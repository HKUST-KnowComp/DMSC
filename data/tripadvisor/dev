2 4 2 -1 3 -1 2 -1		horrible location we visit barcelona on holiday for 4 night .<ssssss>as soon as we arrive at the fira palace we begin to suspect that we have make a mistake in choose this hotel .<ssssss>it be a business hotel located next to the fira barcelona which be a huge facility that host trade fair .<ssssss>there be nothing appealing within walk distance , and navigate to the subway -lrb- a 10 minute walk at least -rrb- be difficult .<ssssss>cab fare to la rambla be 7 euro which mean you have 14 euro in transportation expense every time you venture out unless you like to walk in which case it take 30-40 minute each way.in addition to the unfortunate location , the bed be as hard as a slab of granite which make any activity other than actually sleep impossible and sleep itself be difficult .<ssssss>the hotel staff be indifferent and there be no doorman to help with luggage .<ssssss>after one night we move to hotel 1898 for a few euro more and be very pleased .<ssssss>
3 3 1 5 5 5 5 -1		shabby hotel but great service we book 3 room for 5 day in may .<ssssss>when we arrive , i be very disappointed in the hotel lobby .<ssssss>the leather sofa be crack and wear and the whole room look disshelve .<ssssss>all 3 bedroom be extremely small , which we expect , but my husband and i could not even pass each other in the room .<ssssss>the furniture be very worn , the bed be practically on the floor , and overall , no ambiance .<ssssss>however , the bathroom be modern and very nice .<ssssss>the only reason to stay at this hotel be the service and location .<ssssss>all the staff be very helpful .<ssssss>the front desk be attentive and very nice to help with question , reservation , call taxi , etc. one day after sight-see all day , i come back to my room to find my bottle of white wine on ice by the head housekeeper .<ssssss>what a nice surprise !<ssssss>the neighborhood , rue cler , be absolutely fabulous .<ssssss>my husband and i both agree that when we return to paris , we will definitely stay in the rue cler again but probably choose a different hotel .<ssssss>the hotel be in the midst of renovation and they have a photograph of what the renovate room will look like and they will be ultra modern which be not in keep with this old hotel .<ssssss>so , for that reason , we will look at other hotel in the area next time .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 1 3 3		very unorganized i stay at the edenh from jan 21-28 , all i can say be that this hotel be not ready for customer .<ssssss>i have travel to quite a few place and this hotel be so unorganized .<ssssss>first of all , we wait for we room for a good 3 hour -lrb- there be people wait for 5-6 hour -rrb- after we get we room , 2 hour later a family show up and enter we room state that the front desk give they the room as well .<ssssss>then the rest of the week they front desk call ask for these people ... like be there not any communication after numerous occasion call and visit the front desk .<ssssss>it have to be the most frustrating thing ever .<ssssss>mosquito we all in the room , be prepare .<ssssss>food not so great .<ssssss>i would recommend the asian and american a la carte , but u have to book outside the buffet .<ssssss>i think in time it could be a great vacation spot i mean the hotel be just beautiful the beach be amazing the staff be great -lrb- besides the front desk , who have no idea what they be do -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all we have great weather which make my trip .<ssssss>at this point i would recommend other to stay away until all the resort be actually finish , unless you want you first couple of day to be fill with annoyance and frustration .<ssssss>
2 4 2 5 3 2 2 -1		perfect location but tiny room and unfriendly staff for location in florence , this hotel can not be top .<ssssss>it be literally in the center of everything ... a block from the duomo and a few block from the david and the uffizzi -lrb- pardon the spelling -rrb- .<ssssss>i book it base on location and it be on a main , charming , pedestrian street .<ssssss>many shop ; restaurant ; gelato ; entertainment .<ssssss>location be what it have go for it .<ssssss>you could not book a more centrally located hotel .<ssssss>it be not however as nice as we hotel in rome -lrb- the artimede -rrb- .<ssssss>the front desk staff be not helpful -lrb- they be wonderful at the artimede -rrb- .<ssssss>we triple room be clean but tiny with a odd odor .<ssssss>we feel as though we be in a dorm room - three single bed - little room for anything else .<ssssss>at the artimede we essentially have two room as a triple , each with a king size bed .<ssssss>breakfast which be include be adequate .<ssssss>whenever we make a request of the front desk , we feel as though it be a imposition .<ssssss>for instance , we need a taxi for the airport.when we stay be over ... you can not believe how long it take the front desk to ` get around ' to call a taxi .<ssssss>it be a effort for they to call .<ssssss>when we first arrive at the hotel , we room be not ready -lrb- it should have be - we be not early -rrb- - and the attitude at the front desk essentially be ` tough ' .<ssssss>there be no apology ; no offer to watch we bag while we tour .<ssssss>the follow day , we be out for a day tour ... return to the hotel at 4:00 , and the room still have not be make up .<ssssss>again , we inquire of the front desk and the attitude be ` tough ' .<ssssss>to be honest , we generally deal with the same guy at the front desk so maybe it be just he ... for location , this place get a a plus .<ssssss>for service , a c.<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 1 3 2 4		not a 3-star hotel we stay at this hotel for one night during the easter weekend .<ssssss>we have stay at a fantastic 3-star hotel in milan during the same trip and be very disappointed in the botticelli hotel .<ssssss>the only thing go for it be the location .<ssssss>it be near the san marco piazza .<ssssss>that also be one of the biggest problem .<ssssss>we room overlook a narrow alley type street and motorcycle and scooter use it all night .<ssssss>it be very noisy .<ssssss>additionally , the wall between the room be very thin and we hear more than we want to hear late into the night.the staff be helpful but not overly friendly .<ssssss>the complimentary breakfast be so-so .<ssssss>the room be small and the bathroom even smaller .<ssssss>there be dust all around the perimeter of the carpet room.i would not return to this hotel and would never recommend it .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		buyer beware let I say that i normally wouldnt write a review since i believe most have it out for the hotel but when apple vacation offer this place up as a 6 golden apple hotel they couldnt be more wrong .<ssssss>it might be a four red apple hotel .<ssssss>i will start with the positive .<ssssss>nice big room , nice pool , clean resort , two good restaurant and good entertainment staff .<ssssss>now for the bad , hardly any of the restaurant worker speak english .<ssssss>every day seem like a hassle when ask the cook something .<ssssss>one day they have honey out instead of syrup for breakfast , it take 4 different worker to finally get someone to get syrup .<ssssss>by the time they get it out we food be cold .<ssssss>every day they run out of orange juice and when you ask someone they would say 5 min , 20 min later and still no orange juice .<ssssss>one day my wife and i witness a worker drinking we of the plastic bottle in which they serve the coke and put it back in with the soda they serve the guest , if that be not disgusting i dont know what be .<ssssss>we report it to the manager and he say thank you .<ssssss>now that be 5 star service .<ssssss>in the restaurant the service be as slow as can be .<ssssss>expect to spend about a hour at each place .<ssssss>for the most part once seat it take about 10 minute before they bring you a water and about 15 min for a soda and dont even think about get refill .<ssssss>my wife and i on average wait 10 min or longer for refill once we be finish and the staff didnt look extremely busy .<ssssss>now for the room service , i believe this be do twice a day and the only issue we have with that be that they leave flower on you towel which have ant in they .<ssssss>we didnt have a huge issue with this since they can clean up but it be still something you dont expect out of a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>also 4 out or the 8 day they do not bring wash cloth .<ssssss>they bring towel but not wash cloth so we have to call down to have they bring they to we room , which be 6210 .<ssssss>if you can try to get a 3rd floorl room since they have vault ceiling in they if you decide to still go.now if you be still decide on go to the dominican i hope you be the type that like to lay by the pool or stay on the ocean since there be really nothing else to do .<ssssss>they offer very few excursion and since i enjoy excursion on a daily basis i wouldnt recommend the domincan republic .<ssssss>we do two of they , the outback safari which be a big waste of money since they drive you around dirt road to see how people live and the maranarium .<ssssss>the maranarium be pretty neat since you get to swim with 10ft nurse shark and huge stingray .<ssssss>i would recommend this excursion .<ssssss>anyway like the title say buyer beware , maybe i just hit a bad week or maybe that how the staff really be .<ssssss>all the people on we plane have the same compaint as we do so that show something .<ssssss>compare to other all inclusive , sandal ocho rio , iberostar lindo riveria maya , riu puerto vallarta i would rank this as the worst and with no comparision to the other .<ssssss>
4 2 4 5 -1 4 4 -1		great view i really like the hhv .<ssssss>there be some positive and negative about we staypositive : we room in the rainbow tower be picture perfect .<ssssss>the abc store on site be great .<ssssss>the grounds be spotless .<ssssss>we be able to find chair at the pool .<ssssss>the beach be step away from pool .<ssssss>they come right away to fix the air when it stop work .<ssssss>negative : the people in the store on the property be very pushy , and will try a hard sell .<ssssss>not my style .<ssssss>the hhv people want you to eat on site , and not leave to eat , so they would not provide info about place to eat .<ssssss>we eat breakfast across the street everyday .<ssssss>we do like the pizza place on the property and they be not overprice .<ssssss>i do not think they change the sheet the entire stay of 7 night , the room be clean , but they never clean the floor .<ssssss>we be not messy people so it be ok , but the maid service could do better .<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 3 4 3 1		do not feel like a four star hotel ... to be honest , i expect more from a fairmont hotel .<ssssss>while the fairmont copley plaza be situate in a beautiful , historic building , you do not really get much in return for the price you pay to stay in this hotel .<ssssss>the mini-bar price be absolutely outrageous -lrb- $ 7 for a bottle of water ! -rrb-<ssssss>, and the internet fee be ridiculous -lrb- $ 14/day -rrb- .<ssssss>luckily , i be a member of they president 's club so i do not have to pay the daily internet fee .<ssssss>though the hotel be in a great location and right next a enormous indoor mall , we be give a room with no view , and the furniture be rather old and musty look .<ssssss>i expect a better room -lrb- perhaps with a actual view -rrb- for a president 's club member .<ssssss>i would not stay at this hotel again ... i would recommend the bulfinch hotel which be also in downtown boston , cheaper , and nicer room without the outrageous price !<ssssss>
1 -1 1 1 3 3 3 -1		horrible room i find this hotel on travelzoo and for the price of $ 109 per room/night it seem great value consider the review on tripadvisor .<ssssss>unfortunately we be disappoint when we get there - the room be tiny - and one of they -lrb- 607 -rrb- must have be a convert cupboard as it have a tiny strip window 6 ft from the ground - the colour be a depressing brown .<ssssss>there be no air conditioning in either room.the location be in the financial district - good for if you be in town on business or shopping in union square - for we though fisherman 's wharf be a better and more happen place to stay with children.staff be very nice - they mention that i would have to pay a $ 100 early departure fee as i agree to it when i check in -lrb- i do not think so ! -rrb-<ssssss>and be quite happy to waive this when they hear what room we be in -lrb- 602 and 607 -rrb- .<ssssss>so no i would never stay here again - or a kimpton hotel for that matter - i find it incredible that there be so many positive reveiw for this hotel on this site.by the way this be my first ever negative review on tripadvisor !<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		good but be it safe ?<ssssss>my wife and i enjoy the ambiance , friendly bar staff , close proximity to a beautiful beach , and general cleanliness of this boutique hotel , but be surprised and saddened to have a bag full of souvenier steal from we room .<ssssss>the room and front gate all have the same key in the newly renovate annex -lrb- as do the main hotel -rrb- but the annex have no security at the gate .<ssssss>we room also have no phone in it , and the light in the hall be out and be never fix during the 5 day we stay despite tell they numerous times.the manager and staff be considerate and show concern regard the theft but ultimately do nothing -lrb- not even a complementary drink ! -rrb-<ssssss>about it .<ssssss>the bar/restaurant be very good for a kitchen that consist of a george foreman grill and refrigerator , and the concierge be helpful with reservation etc.your stay in san juan should be a safe one , so be on you guard and do not leave valuable in you room .<ssssss>
4 4 2 -1 4 -1 2 -1		lovely atmosphere , but curtain do not close .<ssssss>we have stay at the elliot a number of time over the last 15 year .<ssssss>we begin stay there when the child be small , because the two-room suite arrangement be perfect for a family with child .<ssssss>we have always love the atmosphere of the elliot .<ssssss>recently they begin redecorate room and the curtain in the redecorated room do not meet in the middle , allow too much morning light .<ssssss>we find we be awaken at dawn by the light , and have no way of close the curtain , or block the light .<ssssss>we look at several room and find this be true of all the redecorated room that we see .<ssssss>the management move we to one of the room that have not be redecorate and that solve the problem.if they park you car , re-gain the car can be slow and confused .<ssssss>one must simply double check , and recheck , that they know , well ahead , when the car be want .<ssssss>
5 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great value for the money my fiance and i stay here for a long weekend and find the hotel to be great .<ssssss>it be recommend by a friend who live in madrid .<ssssss>the location be good , right near the opera and a main plaza , and the subway .<ssssss>it be a cute neighborhood .<ssssss>the staff be nice , the hotel be clean , room be a bit small , but typically european .<ssssss>continental breakfast be good .<ssssss>we be very happy staying here .<ssssss>make sure you ask they to make a reservation for dinner at a local restaurant if you be stay saturday night !<ssssss>otherwise , you will not be able to get a table .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 3 -1 4 -1		great hotel stay at the hotel with my wife for two night on the 22-24 dec. the hotel be lovely , in a great location and worth every penny of the 110 euro a night .<ssssss>i stay in room 64 which be quite large with a smallish bathroom -lrb- all you need to get wash in -rrb- .<ssssss>find the staff friendly enough and have no problem with they .<ssssss>on the downside it be a bit noisy at night and the room be very warm but will stay here again the next time i go to paris .<ssssss>
2 2 2 2 3 1 4 -1		not the greatest !<ssssss>my sister and i just return from 1 week at the excellence .<ssssss>we purchase the excellence club which give you private check in , and a few perk .<ssssss>we book through a agent , who request double bed and on the 1st floor as my sister have a very bad foot problem , on arrival we be take to we room with a king size bed - we tell they it be not suitable and they say they do not have anything available , i be quick to comment that they then should not have take we reservation !<ssssss>eventually 5 hour later and $ 600.00 more dollar we have a room with 2 bed on the 2nd floor .<ssssss>needless to say we first day be horrible .<ssssss>next day get up and go for some breakfast , get out to the pool and no chair - most of they be not be use but have towel on they and be be save .<ssssss>down to the beach , water be rough , we never get in the ocean .<ssssss>the next day and every day after i get up at 6 and go down to save we chair .<ssssss>the weather be not great , rain and cloudy every afternoon .<ssssss>the power and water go out for at least 1 hour if not more a day .<ssssss>the wait for the restaurant be generally 1 hour to 1-1/2 hour , they need a dinner buffet .<ssssss>we never get into the french restaurant the wait be 2 hour , we could not evern get a beeper .<ssssss>overall the food be not great - we live on watermelon and cheese from the buffet and the excellence club .<ssssss>i will definately never go back , i have not travel much but this be my 4th all inclusive , all have be 4-5 star and this by far be the worst , i would not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
1 1 1 2 1 3 1 3		stay away !!!!!<ssssss>i recently stay at this hotel ... please do yourself a favor and stay away ... the room smell bad ... the bathroom be not clean , the sheet be dirty , and to top off everything else ... there be no hot water in the be for a shower .<ssssss>.<ssssss>this be not just my room , but , the entire hotel ... please stay away .<ssssss>
4 5 5 3 3 3 -1 -1		spacious , clean , modern , very reasonably price i spend two night at the b-hotel and be very pleased with my experience .<ssssss>the b-hotel be a great value.other people have say negative thing about the location , but i disagree .<ssssss>in fact , the very competitive rate make the location fantastic , as far as i be concern .<ssssss>it be not right around the corner from most of the tourist-y stuff , but get anywhere from the b-hotel be easy enough on foot , by taxi -lrb- cheap in barcelona -rrb- , bus , or metro .<ssssss>plus , i get to experience a small slice of regular barcelona .<ssssss>i be a solo female and feel completely safe walk to and from the hotel at night .<ssssss>airport transportation to and from the hotel be especially convenient.the room i be give be attractive and very spacious .<ssssss>the room decor be minimalist modern , but not cold .<ssssss>very large floor-to-ceiling window face the placa d'espanya be great .<ssssss>i would not have feel very comfortable stay in the room with a new lover because the bathroom be poorly insulate and open directly onto the room .<ssssss>on the other hand , the toilet be separate from the rest of the bathroom by a slide door , which be nice.that say , there be one thing that really annoy I : the hotel play bothersome music all night long in the hallway and the room be not insulate well enough to block it out .<ssssss>it make I crazy .<ssssss>i live smack in the middle of a large city and be not at all a light sleeper , but have to resort to earplug to deal with the music .<ssssss>they play it during the day as well but the steady hum of traffic outside render it almost unnoticeable .<ssssss>at night , there be no traffic to drown it out .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		it be nice .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the hotel be nice .<ssssss>i be disappoint that i could not use the coupon for free parking because i book online .<ssssss>i be also disappoint that we do not get a room with a balcony that i want , consider most of the room have balcony 's .<ssssss>the guy at the front desk be not friendly , but the rest of the staff be wonderful and the hotel be extremely clean .<ssssss>

2 2 3 1 2 2 3 4		spring hill suprise i stay here for a meeting in september 07 .<ssssss>the location be a little out of the way for a true downtown location .<ssssss>the shuttle service at the seattle airport do not stop at this location so i wasforced to take a ride into downtown and then hire a cab to finish the journey .<ssssss>the hotel do have a shuttle that bring you to town about twice a hour .<ssssss>it be a adequate service and need for this out of the way location .<ssssss>due to the time change my flight arrive pretty early in the day .<ssssss>when book i have request a room to be ready by 10 be so that i would be able to freshen up prior to my meeting .<ssssss>i understand that this be a extra special request for a property at this level .<ssssss>the front desk staff be quite accomodate upon my arrival , note my request , and find a available room within ten minute .<ssssss>imagine my suprise when i find some underwear , use toothpaste , soap , and shampoo still reside in the bathroom that be supposedly ready for my stay .<ssssss>the front desk seem concerned and quickly arrange to send I to another room .<ssssss>overall it be just a average property .<ssssss>i think that there may be a better value for the dollar within a few block of this hotel .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 3 3 4		great hotel !<ssssss>great hotel , v nice rooms!we stay here in march 2006 in a large group with my partner work -lrb- 80 odd -rrb- .<ssssss>we have already be give a upgrade to a suite by the company , so be very pleased to have a room on the 29th floor .<ssssss>the room be very nice and have excellent view down to time square and across to the reuter building and the empire state building .<ssssss>the staff be courteous and helpful and the hotel have a thoroughly modern yet comfortable feel .<ssssss>the non stop express lift from 1-25 make I go dizzy as it be so fast but at least nipping outside -lrb- non smoking hotel -rrb- for a cigarette be not a trek !!!<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 4 2 1		find another place - you do not want to stay here the best part of this hotel be the location .<ssssss>it be only a few yard from bourbon street .<ssssss>other than that , it be one disappointment after another .<ssssss>the price look good when book , but add another $ 12 a night for the resort fee and energy fee .<ssssss>it be ridiculous to charge a energy fee when there be no heat in the building .<ssssss>i stay there on a chilly night and it be cold inside .<ssssss>if i have to pay $ 5 day for energy , at least provide some !!<ssssss>then the resort fee of $ 7 which cover the breakfast , pool and internet .<ssssss>the breakfast be one muffin and coffee .<ssssss>the pool be unheate so unusable , and the internet provide require you to sit behind the cashier desk to use it .<ssssss>aside from that , it be a old building and not very clean - part of its charm , i guess .<ssssss>and do not sleep past 9am or you will not get room service .<ssssss>they leave a note for I that they would not clean my room because the do not disturb sign be on the door , even though i be out of the room -lrb- the sign remove -rrb- by 9am .<ssssss>
3 3 4 1 4 4 4 3		pretty good hotel , a bit out of the way though .<ssssss>the bastion hotel be pretty good i guess , although a bit basic .<ssssss>i have no complaint regard the hotel and its service .<ssssss>everything be adequate .<ssssss>the main problem with bastion be its location .<ssssss>its located between 2 tram stop , so its a 10-minute hike to get to a tram stop .<ssssss>this might sound not so bad , but you have to consider how many time per day you ll have to do it -lrb- in we case 4 time -rrb- and in what state .<ssssss>we didnt mind so much the hike when we start we day in the morning , but come back at the evening or night , dead tired from all the walking and sightseeing , that 10 minute -lrb- 1 km -rrb- hike seem like a lot !<ssssss>moreover the area around the hotel be describe at best , as boring and uninteresting .<ssssss>there be a huge construction site on on side and wood on the other with a canal cross .<ssssss>the area be not like the absolutely magical centre of amsterdam with the lovely canal and magnificent building .<ssssss>its pretty boring .<ssssss>once you get to the tram stop , the actual journey to central amsterdam last only about 10 minute .<ssssss>amsterdam be quite small .<ssssss>look at the location of bastion on a map , it seem like its out in the suburb , but in reality its distance from the centre be very small !<ssssss>the hotel be located right next to a flyover road cross and find its entrance be trickier than you might expect .<ssssss>if you be travel with the tram follow these step ... .<ssssss>get off at surinameplein station .<ssssss>you ll be able to spot the hotel , about 1 km down the main road .<ssssss>now its the tricky part ... .<ssssss>dont approach it by walkin on the side of the road where the hotel actually be !!!!<ssssss>you must walk on the opposite side of the road .<ssssss>if you do that , then halfway through , you ll notice that the sidewalk split up and one can either remain on the street level or follow a path that descend .<ssssss>you must take the path that descend .<ssssss>if you stay on street level , or if you walk on the other side of the road , when you finally approach the hotel you ll discover with horror that the entrance of the hotel be located lower than the street level !<ssssss>you ll find yourself stand on a bridge , overlook the entrance from about 5 metter altitude !<ssssss>thats what happen to we , and then we have to walk all the way back towards the station -lrb- carry heavy luggage -rrb- and pick the right path this time .<ssssss>this have to be the most frustration i ve ever have to face while try to get to a hotel .<ssssss>if you be on the right path , you ll end up in the same lower level where the hotel be , and after turn left and pass under the aforementioned bridge you ll reach the hotel at last .<ssssss>i hope this didnt sound too confusing .<ssssss>maybe it would be a good idea to reach the hotel with a taxi for the first time in order to get you bearing .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 3 4 2		great location , nice hotel this be a nice hotel , in a great location .<ssssss>they be do construction , but that really wasnâ€™t a issue as we be typically out and about while the noisy stuff be go on .<ssssss>i be tell it would be complete by the first of december , but trust I , they werenâ€™t close when we stay there .<ssssss>some guest be demand they be move to another hotel .<ssssss>overall for the price and rating , the property should be better .<ssssss>the personnel be , uh , okay .<ssssss>mostly good .<ssssss>but , they should have be great .<ssssss>they suffer from that ugly syndrome many property suffer from .<ssssss>they mistakenly think they discussion with fellow employee and follow procedure trump the need of they guest .<ssssss>the room be cool , but tiny .<ssssss>it have weird motion light .<ssssss>great when they work properly , annoy when they didnâ€™t.this hotel be right on la rambla , so the location be perfect if you be new to barcelona .<ssssss>if you arenâ€™t a quieter option over in the gothic area might be preferable .<ssssss>if you do spend time walk down la rambla , enjoy the spectacle , but keep you wallet safe .<ssssss>donâ€™t give money to anyone for anything -lrb- okay , maybe a mime or two -rrb- .<ssssss>most local be try to scam you .<ssssss>we watch tourist after tourist get take by the shell gameâ€ ee , the oldest scam in the book.in summary , this property be lean on its namesake .<ssssss>hopefully once the construction be complete , they will also take a look at they guest experience .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 5 5 4 3		awesome my wife and i stay at the resort from may 28 thru june 8 .<ssssss>from the moment we land we be impressed .<ssssss>for some reason i be expect the airport to be small , dark , and dirty .<ssssss>however , the airport be beautiful , and everything go smoothly .<ssssss>we book thru expedia with the hotel transfer .<ssssss>the van be wait for we and off we go .<ssssss>we be the second of four stop , and after about 30 minute we be at the hotel .<ssssss>the ride be entertainment in itself as we almost run over a few folk on scooter , and narrowly miss sideswipe a few other vehicles.as we arrive at the lobby , we be once again impressed .<ssssss>it be beautiful .<ssssss>check in be smooth and fast .<ssssss>we get lucky and get a second floor room -lrb- deluxe -rrb- in build 30 with a ocean view .<ssssss>in addition , it be right next to one of the â€œtrainâ€?stops , so my wife be happy she didnâ€™t have to walk very far for anything .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t know it at the time of booking , but this be off season and one of the â€œtrainsâ€?was out of service for maintenance .<ssssss>even so , the train be pretty regular at around 20 minutes.the first week it rain almost everyday , but sometimes for only 30 minute .<ssssss>however , when it rain , it pour .<ssssss>i enjoy the rain , so it mostly didnâ€™t bother I .<ssssss>the only effect be that the entire resort be very slippery .<ssssss>all the floor be marble , and even the wooden walkway and stone pathway be very slippery .<ssssss>i slip and fall the first night , but luckily no harm be do .<ssssss>if this resort be in the usa , it would be a personal injury lawyer dream.all food and drink be excellent .<ssssss>we tip most everyone , but i didnâ€™t see many other do so .<ssssss>it appear that the service be excellent whether you be tip or not .<ssssss>as mention above , this be off season and some of the restaurant and entertainment be close .<ssssss>however , we never have to wait for anything , and the place wasnâ€™t crowd at all .<ssssss>they give we 3 ala-cart but we ask for a fourth and they give it to we .<ssssss>we have no difficulty in make reservation and always get the day and time we want .<ssssss>in fact , the ala-cart be more than half empty each time we go .<ssssss>they be a great break from the buffet .<ssssss>i think the mexican be the best , but my wife like the spanish .<ssssss>in the seafood restaurant , i order the steak and the lobster -lrb- $ 31 -rrb- .<ssssss>they be great .<ssssss>the italian restaurant be we least favorite.casino â€?bwaa ha ha ha ha ha .<ssssss>always empty .<ssssss>very limited choice of game .<ssssss>$ 10 minimum .<ssssss>doesnâ€™t even sound like a casino .<ssssss>the best part about it be the casino sign out front.i highly recommend the limon lagoon vip tour .<ssssss>i think i have my money worth just by the bus ride and trip to the top of the mountain .<ssssss>throw in the rum drink , cock fight , langostine lobster , cigar rolling , horseback ride on the beach , secluded beach swimming and the lagoon boat ride and it be a real bargain.for shopping , if you donâ€™t want to walk , take the â€œtrainâ€?to the royal suite lobby , and you can walk next door to the shop .<ssssss>behind the shop on the beach be a little city .<ssssss>we find that the better price be in the shop that be not on the beach.return thru the airport go smooth and the wait be comfortable .<ssssss>the only snag be that when you first arrive , one of the airport personnel be pretty adamant to know if you have any mamajuana -lrb- a dominican local drink -rrb- .<ssssss>my wife have buy two bottle for gift , and when we show he , he damage the package .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t notice at the time that he also break the seal , therefore , half of each bottle leak out before we get home .<ssssss>make sure you check it before you put it back in you bags.all in all , it be a great trip , and a great value .<ssssss>

5 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		we cute little room : sheraton 's budget `` manor room '' i book the sheraton 's budget manor wing lodgings when i attend a convention at the hotel in mid-june .<ssssss>since i be unaccustomed to pay high-season rate for airfare to hawaii from the west coast , the convention rate of $ 90 for these room be a godsend .<ssssss>you will not like it if you be picky .<ssssss>the manor wing be a older wing at the front of the hotel , to the right before you enter the lobby .<ssssss>for I it be great .<ssssss>all i want to be in the hotel where everyone else be , and after that all it have to do be be clean , big enough for I and my room-mate , and give starwood point .<ssssss>i pay $ 80 a night less than the next level up -- and that be just for a city view room .<ssssss>manor wing room be small , but not too small .<ssssss>they only have twin bed , but they be firm .<ssssss>there be no lanai .<ssssss>but on the upper floor , you have a decent view of the city for the even-numbered room , and some of the odd-numbered room even have a spot of blue ocean visible !<ssssss>all the manor wing room start with the number 3 , then the floor and then the actual room number .<ssssss>my room be 3708 , which mean 7th floor , room 8 .<ssssss>the 7th floor be high enough up to make the stay enjoyable -- more light , more view .<ssssss>much lower and it might be a bit claustrophobic , since the hotel be really hem in by building .<ssssss>my view on the even-number side of the building be of the mountain , a bit of kalakaua ave. , and of course , the royal hawaiian shopping center building across from the sheraton .<ssssss>my friend , who be stay directly opposite I in 3709 , have the perfect spot for the price : a sunny room with a sliver of blue ocean visible between the other sheraton building .<ssssss>any more to the left or right of he and you lose the little bit of ocean blue .<ssssss>i know because i impose on some fellow convention-goer who have the room next to he and take a look out they window .<ssssss>they could not see the ocean but they could see the unsightly building equipment that be not in my friend 's view .<ssssss>they do have the sunny side , however .<ssssss>i would imagine that many of the other room stack above or below 3709 would have more or less the same view , so it be worth take note of the number .<ssssss>just not the lower floor .<ssssss>my room-mate who share the room with I be thrill .<ssssss>she travel a lot for business and be picky when she need to be .<ssssss>she think the room be cute , just perfect for the price .<ssssss>she have to do business while stay there , so set up the internet service and work in the room each morning just as she would at a business class hotel .<ssssss>not maid service be great , and other than not be in the main part of the hotel , it be great to be on site , just as close to the beach as anyone else in the hotel and have the terrific feeling of get up early in the morning and walk through the lobby and onto the beach for a morning stroll !<ssssss>

5 5 4 3 4 3 5 5		overall a great resort just return from a three night stay at the caribe hilton .<ssssss>this be a great resort , we have a wonderful time .<ssssss>the open air lobby be very nice and all of the staff we deal with be excellent .<ssssss>the pool and beach area be both very nice .<ssssss>you can rent kayak and pool/beach toy at the hut which be located in between the beach and the pool area .<ssssss>there be waiter on the beach on the weekend , but not the weekday i be there .<ssssss>also , on the weekend , there be yoga on the beach at 9:00 a.m. which be very good.not to be overlook be the small cafe in the spa building which be located at the end of the beach , in a seperate building from the hotel .<ssssss>they make wonderful fresh , made-to-order wrap here which we get for lunch everyday and take out onto the beach with we .<ssssss>they also have breakfast item and smoothie .<ssssss>the wrap be only about $ 10 each and much healthier than the menu at the pool bar.the store just across the street be a great place to go to stock up on water , beverage , and snack .<ssssss>the room do have a refrigerator so you can keep you snack cold .<ssssss>the room be very nice , the bed be great .<ssssss>the balcony be big enough to enjoy a cup of coffee on and feature a small table and two chairs.having a starbuck in the lobby be great .<ssssss>a coffee and a bagel in the morning will run you about $ 5 .<ssssss>my only negative remark would be not necessarily about the resort but about puerto rico itself .<ssssss>the shoreline be very build up , one high rise hotel or condo building after another .<ssssss>the building just seem to be on top of each other near the water .<ssssss>it be not a deterrent once you familiarize yourself with the resort , but when i first arrive i be a bit disappointed with how congest the area be .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 3 3 -1		do not even go there this dump be class as a 3 * hotel but it be no better than 1 * and i be be kind at that .<ssssss>first impression be not great - dirty carpeting , no lift and stand-alone air-con that be noisy.the room be very basic and the bathroom though en-suite be cramped.after walk around central florence and see other 3 * hotel it be clear to we that this be a hotel well below that standard and so we check out and move up the street to another hotel .<ssssss>

2 5 3 -1 5 -1 3 -1		ok hotel , but very small uncomfortable bed my husband and i stay at this hotel for 2 night in april .<ssssss>we be look for a inexpensive hotel in the 5th district .<ssssss>i study in paris some year ago and i just love this particular area of the city so i be quite keen on find a hotel in this area for we visit .<ssssss>it be a great location .<ssssss>the hotel be clean .<ssssss>very good price for the room .<ssssss>really inexpensive .<ssssss>the room itself be a decent size .<ssssss>however , the furniture , include the double bed seem like it be miniature size if that make any sense .<ssssss>my husband be about 179 cm -lrb- 6 ' 0 -rrb- and i be about 175 cm -lrb- 5 ' 9 -rrb- and it seem as though we foot be hang off the end of the bed .<ssssss>the bed in and of itself seem like it be only about 140cm wide which seem very small for a double bed at a hotel .<ssssss>at first i think that they have give we a single room by mistake due to the size of the bed and not the size of the room .<ssssss>besides be small , the bed be extremely uncomfortable and i find it really hard to get any good sleep -lrb- which end up make I cranky . -rrb-<ssssss>: - -lrb- the owner of the hotel be not as pleasant as everyone on this site claim that she be .<ssssss>we ask she to help we check on when a particular bus we need to catch to the airport would be leave and she just seem annoyed .<ssssss>as far as the breakfast be concern , i would recommend skip it and go to one of the many cafe in the area .<ssssss>it just wasnt worth the price for what you get .<ssssss>there be croissant , lot of white bread , jam , yogurt , cereal , juice , coffee , water .<ssssss>i would have just prefer to have to a cafe and have a warm breakfast .<ssssss>i be not into eat croissant for breakfast .<ssssss>that be not breakfast to I , but to other this type of breakfast may be fine and totally what you be look for .<ssssss>it be all a matter of what you like .<ssssss>i just want to point out about the possibility of be able to go to a nearby cafe -lrb- of which there be many -rrb- for breakfast if you like warmer food or something else other than what be list above .<ssssss>it be optional at the hotel in paris whether you take breakfast there or not mean that you usually pay extra for it .<ssssss>so you can opt out and spend you money at a cafe instead.i would not stay at this hotel again because of the bed .<ssssss>it be just really uncomfortable .<ssssss>we stay in a room on the 1st floor -lrb- that be the 2nd floor - if you be a american reading this -rrb- and maybe it be just a bad bed and maybe other bed in the hotel be comfortable .<ssssss>i would have pay more to stay somewhere else and have be able to get a proper nite 's rest.otherwise , if you be a couple of inch shorter than we be and do not mind a uncomfortable bed , it be a great location and great price !<ssssss>
3 2 4 1 5 5 5 4		alright if you be not fussy look too good on the internet hence the disappointment with reality .<ssssss>to be fair , it be well equiped for a three star but it be a bit far out , though close to the tube station .<ssssss>the free wireless in the room do not really work and when it do it be very slow .<ssssss>breakfast be a disappointment , i think we pay 36 euro for two ... be not really worth it .<ssssss>roof top pool be also not up to scratch ... i think they be try but it be designer look on the cheap ... staff be 1st rate though .<ssssss>i know there lot of um and arrr here but i would only recommend it if you be not a demand type , that would be happy to have some amenity and do not mind long walk , take the tube or taxis to get around .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 4 3 3 4		average hotel hotel be very good if you be look for something well price for the location .<ssssss>it be only 5 min walk from the champ elysee !!<ssssss>however if you want something with a little bit more class , it be not the right hotel .<ssssss>room be spacious but a bit dated -lrb- but clean -rrb- .<ssssss>i be really impressed with the hotel in general but i be look for something more classy .<ssssss>so i would only recommend the place for people who be look for somewhere where to stay .<ssssss>
4 4 5 2 5 4 5 -1		ok but a bit far from the center the hotel be medium high and be ok for the price we pay -lrb- 90 euro , breakfast include -rrb- .<ssssss>main problem be that we leave the car in a parking for the stay -lrb- crazy price to park in the street -rrb- and have to take public transport .<ssssss>only one bus and the stop be 5 minute from the hotel .<ssssss>in other respects it be ok .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 5 4 3		marco polo prince - great location shame about the room i stay here for a very hot and steamy week in august on a business trip .<ssssss>and i can say that the experience overall be only satisfactory and no better.the hotel itself could not be situate any better .<ssssss>it be build into the harbour city mall , and what a place that be !<ssssss>700 or so top brand name shop that you could seriously bankrupt yourself in - hong kong be not the shopper 's paradise it probably use to be , but you can still shop till you drop!unfortunately the marco polo prince probably live off it be location - whilst the main hotel area be perfectly perfectly presentable , the room themselves be in need of a makeover .<ssssss>that be not to say that they be bad , everything be there and clean as best they can be , but you know that a hotel be a step or two behind when you be hand a actual key -lrb- yes a key !<ssssss>how often do you see one of those these day ? -rrb-<ssssss>for you room.the breakfast buffet be only average at best .<ssssss>on the first day that i be there the cereal that i choose be stale and way past it be best .<ssssss>and when try the hot alternative , the bacon be so overcooked that it explode into a million piece as soon as it be touch with a fork .<ssssss>if you would have to pay hk $ 120 for it , you would have be very disappointed.the lunch buffet i have at the prince deli be awful .<ssssss>it be in theory a beef goulash that i would choose , but it more closely resemble something that i would feed my dog .<ssssss>by contrast the bubble lounge bar serve a excellent lunch , gnocchi as a main course follow by a delightful cheesecake and coffee afterwards.the staff be throughout the hotel be friendly and helpful , particularly the reception staff and bellboy -lrb- one of they be very helpful in elbow I to the front of the taxi queue to get to the airport in a hurry ! -rrb-<ssssss>, so it be just a shame that the room and food do not quite live up to the staff 's enthusiasm .<ssssss>
2 5 2 4 2 3 2 -1		nice location , affordable but barely adequate room we book three room at the mercure kuta for the period of 16-19 august -lrb- 3 night -rrb- , which be at very high season due to a national holiday , for just idr560 ,000 nett -lrb- around usd60 -rrb- from a local travel agency .<ssssss>the good and the bad : very cheap rate inclusive of breakfast , but beware , the staff be very prompt in clear the breakfast buffet which be at 10:00 am sharp - they even start before the hour .<ssssss>the best part about the hotel be the location just across the road from the very busy part of kuta beach - lot of tourist and you can get a massage right on the beach .<ssssss>it be right next to the hard rock hotel and on the other side be a small circle k minmart .<ssssss>there be a small stall right in front of the minimart that sell very delicious brownie call fudgy brownie just for idr4 ,000 or around us40cent .<ssssss>finally , the shower be hot with plenty of water pressure , but we could not take a bath as the bath tub leak and would not hold water .<ssssss>the towel look a bit old for my taste .<ssssss>more of the bad : the room be very small , and poorly design and i banged my head several time on the light fixture near the table .<ssssss>poor lighting in the room , but who want to read in the room in balus .<ssssss>the airconditioning be very cold and we could not turn it down .<ssssss>when we arrive the phone be not work , but even past midnight a engineer come and fix the phone.overall , i would stay there just for the location and if you like to sun tan the hotel have a nice edgeless pool overlook the ocean .<ssssss>

4 4 3 -1 5 -1 5 -1		a acceptable room with a nice staff we just return from 4 day , 3 night at hotel 41 .<ssssss>the location be excellent .<ssssss>it be just a block or so off time square .<ssssss>the only bad thing i can say about the hotel be that the room , even the superior size which we pay extra for , be extremely small .<ssssss>however , this be we first visit so what do we know ?<ssssss>it be clean , the staff be very very nice and accommodate .<ssssss>it be a great place to sleep after a full day of sightseeing/shopping .<ssssss>i would not want to spend any amount of time in the room and in nyc .<ssssss>.<ssssss>who would want to do that ????<ssssss>the bed be a bit uncomfortable at first but when you be dead tired , it suffice .<ssssss>the morning cappacino/coffee/juice / pastry and bagel give you a nice beginning to you busy day .<ssssss>they also have a nice video library to choose from .<ssssss>after all the hussel/bussel and all those people in nyc , it be a quaint nice place to rest and start another day of tourism !<ssssss>the drawbacks-no view , kind of old , bed kind of hard and extremely small .<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 4 5 5 5		pretty good overall my wife and i stay at le pavillon for five night around christmas .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very good -lrb- location not as much , more below -rrb- .<ssssss>the entire staff be extremely helpful and friendly .<ssssss>the architectural design be superior , very ornate in both the lobby and the room itself .<ssssss>because lot of restaurant be close christmas eve and christmas , we order a lot of room service , which be really good , and not too expensive .<ssssss>free use of a computer with internet access on the 2nd floor be very convenient .<ssssss>we also book a good tour of the city , include area devastate by katrina , through a recommendation by the hotel concierge , with dixieland tour .<ssssss>only the sub-par view and the somewhat uncomfortable bed be drawback at the hotel.the biggest problem with the experience be the location .<ssssss>in a completely safe city that have not experience a recent disaster , the 1500 or so foot between the hotel and one edge of the french quarter would be insignificant , but as it stand you can not get between the two without pass lot of abandoned/boarded up office building .<ssssss>as the person check we in say , it be a big city , and if you do not feel safe at night , call a cab .<ssssss>which we do .<ssssss>that say , it be a convenient walk down poydra to the river , and the st. charle streetcar stop nearby , but you can also get these advantage from french quarter hotel .<ssssss>you definitely do not have to worry about loud music at two in the morning at le pavillon , though !<ssssss>
3 3 5 3 5 5 5 -1		pleasant and comfortable we stay for a weekend break to celebrate we 40th immediately after christmas and return before the new year 2008 .<ssssss>the hotel room be very pleasant and comfortable and be glad of the heat in the room after a day outside .<ssssss>staff be very helpful and polite.trams 1 , 2 , 5 stop at spui and the hotel be forward and around the corner and 5 to 600 yard down the road to a inset entrance identify by red carpet step .<ssssss>i think they need a large illuminate sign outside so that it can be see from the corner.i do not know if it be a nh hotel thing but breakfast be very expensive especially with the gbp value fall against the euro .<ssssss>e18 per person for what i would consider a 2 star presentation.a big thank you for the person who write about the broodje bert , lunch cafe just up the street who do a large breakfast for 7 euro , too much for one person , double fire egg , rasher of bacon with side salad on large white or brown bread with coffee and fresh orange drink .<ssssss>mind you it be cold and you keep you coat on and have to eat it quickly against the minus deg temp .<ssssss>we second visit we share one large breakfast , very adequate with very nice helpful people .<ssssss>next visit must be in summer with b/b include .<ssssss>
3 2 3 -1 2 -1 4 -1		great location , a little pricey , view be not the best .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the location to universal be great ... you be able to walk there if the weather permit , but there be also a shuttle every 10-15 minute in the morning , and 15-20 minute in the evening that will take you to citywalk .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and more than willing to help and answer any questions.we stay on the 4th floor , which be not that high up , and on we side , the view be of tree , part of the freeway and a carlot .<ssssss>-lrb- we be not there for the view , but maybe something a little more exciting ! -rrb-<ssssss>the ice machine be diagonal from we room , and would have be perfect if it actually work .<ssssss>so , we decide to try the next floor up -lrb- since the lobby be on the 3rd floor -lsb- yes i know , weird ! -rsb- -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>as soon as the elevator door open , it look like there have be a wrestling match on the 5th floor !<ssssss>maybe they be do some renovation ?<ssssss>it be dusty , look like part of the ceiling be all over the floor .<ssssss>some sign to warn guest would have be smart .<ssssss>be not that some type of saftey hazard ?<ssssss>after look @ each other and decide not to try the ice machine there , we head to the 6th floor.i pay $ 159 per night which now i think be a little pricey ... i would definately stay here again if the rate be no more than $ 100 -lrb- base on the location and service , not the hotel room itself -rrb- .<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 3 1 3 -1		some good , some bad this be we second stay at a all-inclusive , and some thing be great , other bad .<ssssss>this be the first vacation i can recall where everything seem like it be really good or really bad ... very little that be in the middle.first , the positive .<ssssss>the resort be a short 20 minute cab ride from the airport -lrb- $ 25 for up to four people -rrb- .<ssssss>the beach and pool area be huge , and you could easily find chair at any time of day even though the resort be full when we be there .<ssssss>the beach and grounds be beautiful and the quality/selection of drink at the bar be much better than the other all-inclusive we have stay at .<ssssss>the reservation-only dinner restaurant we eat at have great food , and the room be quite large with a nice balcony .<ssssss>the wedding coordinator do a wonderful job with we friend ' ceremony and private reception .<ssssss>the outdoor bar next to the american grill restaurant be a great place to hang out at night .<ssssss>nobody try to sell we on the timeshare club the whole time we be there , and the vendor sell parasailing and other water activity that cost money be not hassle guest on the beach at all.unfortunately , there be a number of negative .<ssssss>check in/out be abysmally slow .<ssssss>come in , i be first in line and it still take 30 minute to get check in .<ssssss>reservation for the restaurant be hard to get -lrb- we do not stay in royal service , which apparently give you priority -rrb- , and then when you sit down to eat , the restaurant be only 1/3 full .<ssssss>consider that there be ton of resort staff walk around , you would think they could add a few more front desk clerk and restaurant server .<ssssss>the buffet be the only option for breakfast and lunch , and alot of the food seem to have be sit out for some time and be cold .<ssssss>the shower 's water temperature be nearly impossible to control -- sometimes it would come out hot and other time cold .<ssssss>there be nothing to do outside of the resort that be within walk distance.overall , it be a nice place to stay , but seem a little pricey compare to other vacation we have take , give some of the negatives.definitely make sure you have some comfortable shoe , as you will be walk quite a bit if you do not want to wait for the train -lrb- and with all we eat and drink during the trip , a little walking probably do we some good ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>
4 5 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		the beach make it this be we second trip to punta cana , and we fifth all inclusive resort , include another iberostar on the riviera mayan .<ssssss>we travel with we two boy age five and ten.the bavaro beach be wonderful , and really the main reason to go to punta cana .<ssssss>we all have so much fun playing in the ocean everyday .<ssssss>really a spectacular experience .<ssssss>the water be warm yet always have pretty good surf and wave to play in.the resort be nice .<ssssss>the grounds be beautiful -- we child love the flamingo .<ssssss>the room be just okay .<ssssss>we have a standard and i think we be use to have we room upgrade to a jr. suite , so maybe that be why i be not very happy with the room .<ssssss>it have two double bed that be very hard .<ssssss>we do have a single roll away that be very comfy and already set up when we arrive .<ssssss>in addition , the couch be make into a bed , also .<ssssss>so , we basically have four bed without ask for the two extra to be make up for we .<ssssss>that be nice.the food here be okay , not great .<ssssss>but , i have to say that i think that might be typical of all inclusive in the dominican republic .<ssssss>we have also stay at the paradisus in punta cana , and remember the food to be only okay.the resort be divide into two side -- the dominicana and the punta cana .<ssssss>from we experience , i like the punta cana side a little better because it be better suit for family .<ssssss>the dominicana side have all the activity , the pool be louder , etc. some of the activity be not really suit for young child -- for example the drinking contest follow by several contestant fall into the pool because they be too drunk to stand .<ssssss>you can use either side , so you can choose what type of atmosphere you be look for -- either could be fun , just not right for everyone .<ssssss>i mention this because we do not check out the punta cana side until a few day into the trip because we think the two side be identical .<ssssss>while they be a mirror image , there be a difference in atmosphere , especially by the pool.i love bavaro beach and be sure we will return , but will probably look at the iberostar bavaro or another resort next time .<ssssss>i think the increase cost of the iberostar bavaro might be worth it .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 5 2		beautiful room , not great for business my wife and i stay at le germain for a week in november this year .<ssssss>we be primarily there for a business trip , but also hold a birthday party for my wife le germain 's apartment suite.the apartment suite be the perfect place to hold a small party -lrb- 12 people -rrb- and we love that le germain do not give we any trouble when we bring in we own food and liquor for we get-together .<ssssss>the staff be very helpful in get thing set up and make sure we have enough dish in the kitchen , etc. we have a fabulous night and would definitely book there again for that kind of event.for the rest of we stay , we have a standard room with a king bed .<ssssss>the room itself be very spacious and beautifully decorate - it feel very luxurious .<ssssss>it be also very quiet .<ssssss>there be plenty of closet and drawer , even in the bathroom , which be great when you be stay for a week .<ssssss>the staff be very solicitous and friendly and bring anything we need quickly.the room set-up be not very convenient for more than one person work or dine - there be a small desk , a desk chair and a big armchair .<ssssss>they be happy to bring we a extra chair , but it be still crowd - funny , give the size of the room .<ssssss>also , the tv do not pull out or swivel , so if you want to watch tv and eat dinner , you have to eat on the bed .<ssssss>not that important and not the kind of thing you would care about during a short stay - but for a longer stay , it be a little inconvenient.speaking of the bed - i be not usually fussy about mattress , but i personally find we bed the most uncomfortable hotel bed i have ever sleep in .<ssssss>too hard for I and it take nearly a week after we stay for the kink to disappear from my neck.we be both work in the room at time and find both the wireless internet and the actual internet port very unstable .<ssssss>we room be at the end of the hall , far from the elevator .<ssssss>if you be there for business , i would suggest stay closer to the middle , to make sure you have a good internet connection.breakfast be include and be always a lovely continental spread .<ssssss>coffee be divine and the breakfast staff be really lovely.overall , i enjoy we stay - i would definitely stay there again for a shorter time or a special occasion .<ssssss>and it be a great location - close to transit , restaurant , movie theatre , live theatre , etc. .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 1 2 1 1		never again .<ssssss>the best thing this hotel have be its location and they know it , this be the only way i can explain they be still in business .<ssssss>the staff be unexperienced , and rude ; there be only one person at the front desk -lrb- that be when there be actually one at all -rrb- i arrive one hour after the check in time and the room be not ready yet , i have to wait for another hour because the maid be too busy .<ssssss>when i finally make it to my room the linen be dirty with every kind of stain and hair you can imagine .<ssssss>i have to request new linen but the maid refuse to change the pillow case because she have forget they , she get very upset when i tell they change they the next day be not a option.the internet connection be awful , most of the time be not work and eventhough this can be solve by reset the modem , there be only one guy who can do it and he will only do it if you insist a lot.if you be plan a extended stay here , do not bother on pay for clean service , the maid will only clean you room when they feel like do it and they can not even do the bed on a decent way.the thing that shock I the most happenn the last day when i try to check out .<ssssss>it be about 5am and the desk be unattended and the door unlock , and it last like that for at lest 20 minute until i be able to wake the person in charge up .<ssssss>anyone on probably the most unsafe neighbourhood of the city can get into the hotel at early hour of the morning.other thing i think people should know be : - there be only one elevator , and it be stinky , small , old and very slow.-there be no phone not cable tv in rooms.-the building be old and the floor squeaky.-you might have to share you room with cockroach as i did.-there be no electronic keys.i have be in budget hotel before but this one should not even be call hotel .<ssssss>i would have change somewhere else but with memorial day around those day every hotel in the area be full but this one , now i know why ...<ssssss>

1 1 2 -1 5 -1 1 -1		a waist of good money well i book this hotel on the review i have read on trip adviser , i book the cultural package which sound ideal , this be to include , two night in double deluxe room - buffet breakfast - welcome gift in room -lrb- bottle of spanish wine -rrb- - late check out - half day use of a mercedes smart car -lrb- subject to availability -rrb- - daily press - free entrance to all museum and important discount in shop , restaurant ... - late check-out .<ssssss>we arrive saturday afternoon for a 2 night stay with very high expectationswhat we get wasstandard double room , i have to ask for the bottle of wine after search for it for 10 min , no mention of the use of a car , check out time be 12 o clock as normal not later as promise on the promotion , all the museum be close as be all the shop for some strange reason madrid close on the may day weekend sun - mon so the museum pass and shop , restaurant discount be absolutly useless.i never receive a newspaper throughout my stay .<ssssss>all in all it be a very dissapointing weekend which i pay a lot of money for .<ssssss>
2 2 4 2 3 2 1 1		terribly overrated !<ssssss>at $ 600 a night , i expect more , particularly in the service department .<ssssss>although i have request a early check-in and arrive several hour later than foresee , my room be not ready when i arrive at 3 pm .<ssssss>as it face a six-lane motorway , it be not exactly quiet either , despite be locate on a high floor .<ssssss>the location of the hotel be not all that great either unless you be a slot machine addict and pachinkos -lrb- the japanese version of gambling -rrb- be you thing .<ssssss>the hotel use old-style real room key , so fitting they in the correct hole in the dimly light corridor after a night out can be a challenge .<ssssss>while i think the electronic music channel in the hotel room be very nice , this alone do not justify the exorbitant price and the zero service .<ssssss>the tv have only american and japanese channel , so french , german or spanish guest have no chance of catch up with what be go on at home .<ssssss>by all means , go and enjoy the spectacular view by have a drink or a meal at the hotel but when you go to tokyo stay at a hotel that be worth its price .<ssssss>
2 2 2 2 4 5 -1 -1		overall , disappointing we have one night in oahu as a stopover from a week in kauai , and choose the moana surfrider as a final slurge before head home .<ssssss>the hotel be beautiful , with a lovely historic lobby , shady courtyard surround a huge banyon tree , and a nice , but small stretch of private beach .<ssssss>the location be excellent , although we be not prepare for the traffic congestion -lrb- it take we almost a hour to drive 2 mile along waikiki beach to the hotel -rrb- and the steep self-park/valet fee -lrb- $ 20 and $ 25 , respectively -rrb- .<ssssss>while the public space be nicely do , the room feel cramped .<ssssss>we request a ocean front room , but end up with a courtyard view in the historic banyon wing , where you could see the ocean out of the tiny window if you crane you neck .<ssssss>however , since we be on the second floor , most of we view be actually the awning cover the dining room .<ssssss>not the kind of view you would expect for $ 350 + per night .<ssssss>the king bed be very comfortable , but we do not get the restful sleep we hope .<ssssss>the band in the courtyard play until late in the night .<ssssss>i finally have to turn on the tv and set the sleep timer to mask the load music .<ssssss>after get to sleep late , we wake up early to muffle sound of someone talk on a microphone - must have be in one of the meeting room near we on the second floor .<ssssss>i do not understand why someone would start a meeting at six a.m. on a saturday morning , but that be apparently what happen .<ssssss>this appear to be a hotel popular for wedding and convention .<ssssss>it be such a contrast to the peace and quiet we have on kauaus , where the only sound at night be crash wave .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 3 4 4		not what i think we book the celebrity resort waikiki after read the review from other traveller .<ssssss>i have to switch room after my first night .<ssssss>the pull out bed be blood stain and the small lanai face a apartment building with a view of the tenant ' garbage .<ssssss>the first front desk clerk i speak to say there be no room available to switch .<ssssss>but after my travel agent contact they , there be two room available that they could move we to .<ssssss>we be move to another room that seem cleaner but a similar view.another front desk clerk , aaron , be helpful the rest of the trip offering suggestion for dining , etc. he make a effort to learn guest ' name , acknowledge anyone who walk through the lobby and offer my daughter flower on the last day .<ssssss>he be a gem!i do not have trouble with housekeeping as previously inidicate by another guest .<ssssss>a nice little touch be a white board in the room so if you have any request or comment for housekeeping , you could indicate it on the white board .<ssssss>what a great idea!the location be good , the staff be helpful -lrb- except we first night -rrb- , they have free internet use with a 10 minute limit , and a activity desk to get information on the area .<ssssss>they also offer free scuba lesson in the pool on tuesday .<ssssss>however , the room be not what i expect .<ssssss>we end up be in three different studio room during we stay -lrb- we pay $ 10 to use a room to shower in on we last day after we have already check out -rrb- , and none of they be the same .<ssssss>the shower room that we use be cleaner , bigger kitchenette , bigger lanaus and bigger bathroom .<ssssss>i think you have to be very specific on you need when select a room or you will be disappoint .<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 3 5 5 -1		hotel meridiana my wife and i stay at hotel meridiana for 4 night the last week of november .<ssssss>we be with a tour group of about 50 people to mostly see florence and surround area .<ssssss>the hotel be a bit of a walk from the main downtown area of florence ... i would guess about 30 minute .<ssssss>if you be from the state , i would say this be like a 3 star hotel , similar to a super 8 .<ssssss>it be definitely european style , which may be different than american be use to .<ssssss>it be clean , but older .<ssssss>the bathroom and shower be quite small , but adequate .<ssssss>do not forget you electricty converter if you be go to use a electric shaver or curl iron .<ssssss>we do not spend much time in the hotel , and it be definitely not a place to hang out , but then again there be so much to see in florence that it would be a wast to stay in the room .<ssssss>the free breakfast be mostly bread , cereal , a little fruit and coffee and juice .<ssssss>pretty good for a light breakfast .<ssssss>there be not a whole lot of restuarant in the area , but we venture a dozen block or so and find some quaint neighborhood restuarant .<ssssss>there be a grocery store about 2 block from the hotel where you can purchase about anything food or drink-wise .<ssssss>my overall impression be that the hotel be adequate , but not anything special .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		a faux pas if we return to this hotel , it would only be its location .<ssssss>however there be plenty of hotel around there , which would certainly do more in every aspect than only acclaim its history , reputation and service on pamphlet .<ssssss>
4 3 2 4 4 2 4 2		lovely location - service need alot of work the location and the feel of this resort be quiet and relax , it be gate and feel safe for family with young child .<ssssss>what i only realise during we stay be that each villa be individually own , and if there be something that need fix in you villa , they need to call the owner to get permission first .<ssssss>this result in a very varied standard of villa - some be own by local family who have everything , some by investor who keep the bare minimum ammenity .<ssssss>with a young family i have plan to cook some meal in , i end up borrowing pan just to cook pasta !<ssssss>the website give you the ability to order food in advance to be in you villa when you arrive - a nice touch if it actually happen - we arrive 3pm on saturday and nothing have arrive by 9am sunday so i cancel the order and do it myself.eclipse - the restaurant on the beach be great food but really really slow service .<ssssss>service be better at lunchtime if you have young kid .<ssssss>overall we have a lovely time due to location and the ability for we younger kid to enjoy themselves in a safe location , with the right villa this could be even better but villa montana need to decide whether it be go to offer the service of a luxury resort or not - it be pretend to but it really cant live up to it right now .<ssssss>

1 1 4 4 4 1 1 1		horrible , incorrigible , the worst experience ever !<ssssss>I and my colleague be hold a event at swissotel over the weekend and stay in they club rooms.the experience have be so terrible i do not know where to start.first from the check-in .<ssssss>we be tell early check-in at 8am be available a day before we arrive and when we arrive , we be tell that there be no room available after lunch .<ssssss>the worst thing be i see they check in another couple to the club room and when ask , they say they have no king room , only twin room .<ssssss>but my colleague have book a twin room !<ssssss>next , we have box of collateral that we have leave with the hotel .<ssssss>on monday morning , they tell we they could not find it .<ssssss>this mean that we have to go for we meeting without the collateral .<ssssss>on the same day , dhl deliver 3 more box to we .<ssssss>the hotel staff could only find box 1 and could not find the other 3 box .<ssssss>concierge and reception just keep push we to the other section and the box be only find the next morning!now to the room , we key have to be change so many time because they be not work .<ssssss>my key have to be change a total of 5 time !<ssssss>and when i go into the room in the evening , the carpet be soak wet at the area inside the door .<ssssss>and the best part of it all be that when we complain to they operation manager on duty , all he could say be we apologise and we will look into it in a most nonchalent manner without offer to make any form of compensation .<ssssss>we totally can not believe the attitude of this hotel especially when we be give they business in the form of a conference and guest who book the hotel due to the conference.we be not unreasonable people and we can understand that sometimes there be slip-up .<ssssss>but the bad attitude of the staff and manager be completely inexcusable.this be absolutely the worst experience i have ever have with a hotel and they can be sure we be never go back .<ssssss>for the price you pay , i suggest you go over to other hotel within the vacinity that would most probably be ton better than this !<ssssss>

3 4 1 5 4 2 4 4		good try but diamond be a bad word here what a great hotel but we too get stick in that horrible diamond wing , they also promise we a move to another room in the morinng but when we go down we be tell there be nithing available all day it be 7 be and there be over 55 room check out , but they be really busy and it be obviously easier to say no to we than redo the room allocation -lrb- and i be not the type that yell and scream and demand , while the meek may inherit the earth we never get the good hotel room -rrb- it be really frustratingi be a big westin fan and be excite when we see the hotel be rebrand ... my wife and i spend we honeymoon in a dingy hotel down the street and we dream of one day be able to stay here many -lrb- too many -rrb- year ago ... we be head back to waikiki this summer with we girl but i think we will have to find another spot to lay we head ... maybe it be time i suck it up and pay the halukalanus ...<ssssss>

4 4 4 5 5 4 4 2		good value for the money we arrive via tnt charter and really be impress with all the tnt people from the one that meet we outside of custom and escort we and take we luggage to the bus .<ssssss>as other have say the ride to the resort give you a better appreciation of the dominician people attitude see how they live .<ssssss>the t.n.t. rep have a group meet the next morning with all its customer at each resort lobby to explain the available tour and other activity in the country , the rep at the meetin cover most question plus tour to medical emergenccy , for those unaccustomed to foreign country he put you at ease that they be always avaiable even give he cellphone number say call 24/7 also tnt have a large booklet at the main desk with all the info they give you in case you miss something .<ssssss>would not hesitate to use they again , the bus be top quality .<ssssss>the resort , some people will find anything complain about .<ssssss>all in all we have a great time .<ssssss>that be say we go with the idea of want sun , beach and relaxation , no spring breaker , no child , and late nite life be not important .<ssssss>so we do not try the disco .<ssssss>we find the room clean and as advertise , the exception be the bathroom it be a little worn in place , example the couple of rust spot in and around the tub from be chip , -lrb- come on guy that a easy fix -rrb- , some grout around the tile work again a easy fix .<ssssss>the room be clean , we leave $ 4 for the maid every morning and always find it spotless with fridge refill , ask for extra towel once and get they every day of we stay , please bring a little something to leave for they we bring school supplies crayon , color book and leave they with she .<ssssss>room key we always have problem with one not work , we would take it to the main desk who quickly replace it then the other would not work , after three time we give up and just rely on the one key , probably should have make they give we two new key .<ssssss>electrical , be 110 volt just like in the u.s. other have say you need a adapter , you do not what you need be a extension cord with additional outlet as there be only two outlet in the room , plus they outlet be recess in the wall , anything that plug in with the cord come out the back be no problem , but hair dryer cellphone charger with large block that the prong come out of will not fit in the recess , they do sell extension for $ 1.00 each or you might finagle one out of maintennace like we do , but for the agrravation its easier to bring a extension cord with mutiple outlet and/or one of those gray color two prong to three prong adapter you can get in home depot for 75 cents.food the restaurant be excellent but a pain to wait in line to make you reservation for and then to find they be never more than 1/3 full .<ssssss>service be always exceptional , the dominican people be as everybody say unbelivable friendly , do be generous and tip they ... we talk to one and could not believe the work schedule they have .<ssssss>its almost from sun up to sun down with something like 12 day on and two day off unless they need then no day off .<ssssss>or no job .<ssssss>.<ssssss>many work mutiple job on the resort through out the day and yet .<ssssss>.<ssssss>still be as friendly .<ssssss>food at the buffet , on one hand the menu vary little but there be sufficient variety of main course etc. one big complaint if one accustom to u.s. standard of food handle it be a little unsettling to see the tray of meat out on display without cover or protection from the patron -lrb- same for the coldcut , they look like they be always out to long -rrb- or for that fact watch the cook pick up the meat with he bare hand and toss they on the grille ... come one at least give the cook a set of tong or something .<ssssss>if you like salad you kinda of have to improvise between the mex table -lrb- onions/peppers -rrb- and the salad bar for everything ... the entire time i be there i do not see a tomatoe that look edible , but the rest be fine .<ssssss>we do not find the meat over cook as other have complain and it be easy enough to make request to the cook ... the pasta cook be a experience definetly try it .<ssssss>all in all with a few exception and common sense the food be excellent both at the buffet and restuarant .<ssssss>the beach although we do not get into any war over lounge and not be early riser -lrb- hey we be on vacation -rrb- it be a problem with people reserve lounge with they towel , what be worse we would sit on the beach from 10-11 be to 5 pm and never see anybody near most of these reserve lounge .<ssssss>it be a problem and they should figure out how to address it .<ssssss>they constatnly be clean the grounds plus rake and pick up the beach .<ssssss>they should be able to monitor this better .<ssssss>if you a prude or have child , the toplessness , thong , and speedo although not everywhere be out there ... the place be heavily favor by people from s. america and europeon ... to they its not a big deal ... so when in rome i guess ... we actually quietly joke about it , the one that do should not and the one that could do not .<ssssss>anyways if you not use to it you could be offend .<ssssss>the night life around the main lobby be subdue but good for a after dinner nightcap , the entertainer be excellent as other have say although we be disappoint the band do not play longer -lrb- only like two hour a night -rrb- .<ssssss>the drink you need to specify you want alcohol in they and what alcohol even then i drink plenty of tequila sunrise with no kick .<ssssss>only one local beer be avaiable as well as the local coffee both be actually very good .<ssssss>the beer be meduim body kind of like miller or michelob , not watery or light like bud .<ssssss>you do need to deal with the language barrier , but the dominician be patient with you , reciprocate .<ssssss>all in all its a nice relaxing resort for the money its a deal the few minor thing i mention be no brainer and should be address .<ssssss>we would definettly go back .<ssssss>hint .<ssssss>.<ssssss>spend sometime before hand and immediately on arrival get the layout of the resort and where everything be so you dont miss anything , we be still find place after a week .<ssssss>oh there it be<ssssss>
1 1 1 1 1 3 3 -1		overpriced flophouse my god , what can i say about this hotel that have not be say already ?<ssssss>i be not a picky traveler and have travel all over the world -- that mean i have stay in some really dodgy area and in some place that be dive .<ssssss>this surpass they all by far .<ssssss>we accommodation fall through , so we be leave with day to find a decent hotel for friday night , 4/13 .<ssssss>since thing in the area be sell out or completely out of we price range , we settle for this hotel at over $ 150/night .<ssssss>i have never feel more rip off than when i make my way through the leak outer corridor and ghetto-type inner corridor to see the abomination that be we room.it smell , the carpet be crunchy , it look like the bedspread have not be wash since the 1960 , there be dirt everywhere , and we be afraid that the shower head be go to fall on we head when we brave a shower .<ssssss>as for positive , i would have to say that the location be superb , even though every pass cab keep on go as we wait out front for over 1/2 hr -- we presume it be because of the type of clientele that would frequent this establishment .<ssssss>the front desk people be also helpful and i feel badly that they have to represent this decrepit property .<ssssss>oh , we also get to park for free , so that be a plus , too .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be passable , even though it be hold in a moldy conference room.all in all , a complete and total rip-off and quite literally the worst place in which i have stay in my entire life .<ssssss>that be say a lot .<ssssss>
4 3 2 4 2 5 4 -1		very hip place i find this place use tripadvisor , and be not expect too much .<ssssss>but this place have amazing character and be fun to stay in .<ssssss>the room be so-so - nothing great , but they be clean and serve its purpose .<ssssss>but the courtyard area be very hip , and the front-desk folk be very friendly .<ssssss>the lounge be close when we be there -lrb- it be a sunday -rrb- , but late night they turn on the heat-lamp for I and my friend so we could hang out , which be great .<ssssss>i would recommend this place if you be look for a cool , hip place with lot of character .<ssssss>
1 -1 2 4 2 3 1 1		inept for business traveler the belvedere , which be a clean , relatively modern hotel , should be avoid by business traveler or those need internet access .<ssssss>first , while they advertise wireless access they only provide it at $ 9,95 per day .<ssssss>ok .<ssssss>however , it be a unreliable system as each day i have twice not be able to relog on and each time the hotel want to connect I , to technical service in some voice mail jail of a third party provider .<ssssss>after waitng far too long i have demand a second username and password ; which for 2 day they just give I .<ssssss>today they refuse .<ssssss>they they put someone on the phone who claim to be the manager .<ssssss>imagine a manager deal with a guest 's log on issue .<ssssss>this place be definitely mis-managed .<ssssss>so , i finally say i refuse to waste my time on they problem , and await technical support as my computer work all over nyc wirelessly and have here also .<ssssss>so , i be finally just access the net via my phone and avoid they poor service .<ssssss>in addition , its only 802.11 b and for $ 9. ,95 a day you would expect at least g service .<ssssss>finally , i will simply share the the sheet be cheap the bed spread look like my grandmother 's and the chair do not fit in front of the desk so the desk be useless .<ssssss>other than that , so far , and i be 4 day into a 6 day trip , its be ok .<ssssss>i think i will check out a day early and just never return .<ssssss>i come to nyc every 4 week and have find plenty of other more enjoyable place such as casablanca , hotel 373 , club quarter or the residence inn all of which accomadate my need just fine .<ssssss>i just like to try new place which be why i end up here , but not again .<ssssss>
5 5 5 4 4 2 -1 -1		love the renaissance !<ssssss>wow , what a hotel .<ssssss>when we make this reservation we figure that a airport hotel would be noisy and dirty ... this be neither !<ssssss>this hotel be far enough away from the airport that you do not realize you be next to it.the room be fantastic !<ssssss>what a bed !<ssssss>bathroom be clean and bath product be lovely .<ssssss>coffee in the room , no breakfast included.on-site restaruant be expensive , but the food be good.concierge give we a great recommendation for breakfast in manhattan beach call ??<ssssss>front desk staff need a lot of work .<ssssss>i call to arrange a early check in prior to noon and they be nasty about it be a first come first serve basis .<ssssss>when i call to cancel the request due to a snow storm , the reiterate that there be no request make and it be first come , first serve anyway.parking - be prepare to pay $ 20 to park!if this be what all marriott renaissance be like , we would stay at more !<ssssss>this be a luxury airport hotel !<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 3 4 3 -1		a hotel in barca that will take child hotel be half way down las ramblas , just 20 mtr along one of the many small streets.the hotel entrance be very nice , the room be clean but very basic .<ssssss>it be mdf heaven , everything make of it .<ssssss>we room be in a annex that be reach by cross the garden area .<ssssss>there be stair but the porter take we case so it be not a problem.i do not think i would stay there again but very few hotel in barcelona cater for a family of 4 .<ssssss>it be convenient , clean and the staff be nice .<ssssss>the breakfast be the worst i have ever have and if you want a drink in the bar you have to sit outside .<ssssss>the bed be very hard , after 4 night i be glad to get home to my comfy bed.it 's cheap , reasonably cheerful and be clean .<ssssss>
3 4 4 2 5 3 4 -1		ultra modern with a slightly clinical feel and quite far from the action .<ssssss>we have just return from a short three night break in barcelona and stay at the hotel caspe.the hotel be deck out in ultra modern chrome and glass style , unoffensive room and leisure area although we find the decor overall to be quite clinical and lack in any kind of ambience ... -lrb- this be not a huge problem though as we pack a lot into we trip and spend very little time hang out in the hotel . -rrb-<ssssss>we room be airy and comfortable -lrb- the bed extremely so ! -rrb-<ssssss>and we manage a excellent peaceful night kip each night .<ssssss>also , the walk in shower and seperate bath be good.having read the other review i do not find the staff to be unfriendly or rude but at the same time they do not fall over themselves !<ssssss>... -lrb- athough the barman be very chatty and helpful . -rrb-<ssssss>location wise , this be not ideal , whilst not far from the sagrada familia , central barcelona and the rambla be a good twenty to twenty five minute walk although there be regular bus and the metrolink be close by .<ssssss>overall we have a pleasant stay and plan to return to barcelona again but probably not to this hotel.one final thing ... if you be a live music fan check out harlem jazz club -lrb- carrer de la contessa de sobradiel 8 ... just off la rambla -rrb- they have live music every night -lrb- we see a fantastic cuban band -rrb- ... .<ssssss>the place get jam so arrive early !<ssssss>
2 1 2 5 3 3 3 -1		good location ... but do not expect a good night of sleep agree with the most recent review here , which basically state that the location be fabulous , but the hotel be not great .<ssssss>we executive room be rather shabby -lrb- old carpet , old linen , bathroom fall apart -rrb- , but the renovation should take care of that .<ssssss>the problem be that the wall be so thin that we could hear the next door neighbour use they electric toothbrush - it be like be in a hostel !!!<ssssss>in the last two night , we have to move room because the new guest in the next room be rowdy and we could not sleep.the gym be also rather naff , by the way !<ssssss>
3 4 4 2 4 3 2 3		small room but really value for money the room be rather small but i be well prepare for that since i have check up on it on a few travel website -lrb- include trip advisor -rrb- .<ssssss>however there be a lack of storage space since the closet be really small .<ssssss>recommend to book a double room as its bigger than a twin room -lrb- since price be same -rrb- .<ssssss>even the closet and toilet seem bigger in the double room .<ssssss>location wise , it be definitely not you touristy area and it look like it be situate in this metal industrial area .<ssssss>but that be still bearable since it be not particularly noisy or anything .<ssssss>it be about 10 min from the main shopping area of kowloon and maybe 20 min from tsim sha tsui , hence will really require a lot of walk or cab ride .<ssssss>staff be not exactly very courteous but you can still live with that .<ssssss>i would not mind stay there again as the room be really clean and neat and its value for money ; it cost less than $ 100 per night .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 3 1		good location , clean , tidy great location , room be not huge but work for sleeping.we have one of the room on the 6th floor with private bathroom , shower etc in the suite.you could hear the street noise if you leave the double window open .<ssssss>but once close do not hear anything , but do have to keep the fan on as the room get quite hot.loved the free muffin and coffee in the morning , if we get up early enough to enjoy before head out for the day.staff be fair , stay in many other hotel where the staff have be more helpfull and attentiive .<ssssss>but overall not complaints.great location , close to everything with taxi stand across the road if require .<ssssss>
4 4 4 3 4 5 4 2		good choice stay here 1 night at the end of we vacation after snowboard .<ssssss>would have stay the w but they jack up the rate .<ssssss>check in be a breeze and they have my extra pillow ready for we .<ssssss>i think we be upgrade -lrb- not sure -rrb- but we have a great view of the bay and a slightly obstruct view of the needle .<ssssss>i also stay at the w seattle 4 night -lrb- please see review -rrb- .<ssssss>the gym be the largest i have ever see with hot tub , sauna , and steam room .<ssssss>-lrb- my wife and i take advantage of all of they -rrb- .<ssssss>outstanding facilite .<ssssss>the restroom be huge with a tub and shower .<ssssss>location be good but not the best .<ssssss>i agree with other reviewer that the hyatt hasnt put any seattle touch to the place .<ssssss>overall good stay and would stay there again .<ssssss>
4 4 1 4 3 3 4 1		new bed need we would love to see fairmont replace the bed here with a luxuriousness and quality to match the setting .<ssssss>and hold the cinnamon scent in the lobby area in the morning at christmas time - it be a bit overpowering and reminiscent of express-motel '' free cinnamon-bun-breakfast .<ssssss>try a background scent of good quality coffee mingle with floral overtone from lobby arrangement .<ssssss>

2 2 2 1 3 4 2 3		be aware ... do you research before you go !<ssssss>we just return from the grand oasis punta cana on april 13 , 2008â€ irst i need to say that iâ€™ve be a member of trip advisor for a number of year and always read the review prior to book a resort .<ssssss>i have find this site have give I some great information from resort to travel advice .<ssssss>this be my first time write a review because i havenâ€™t have any problem and have always be very happy with my vacation .<ssssss>however , i realize during this trip , whether itâ€™s a good experience or a bad one , i vow to write review so other can benefit .<ssssss>unfortunately this year i be start with a not-so-good review.a little information about meâ€ â€™ve be go to the dominican for eight year .<ssssss>we start in the puerta plata area before discover the wonderful beach on the punta cana side so this be where we have vacation for the past five year .<ssssss>each year we choose a different â€ ?<ssssss>-5 â€?star resort like the melia caribe , bahia principle , casa de mar , caribe club princess etc. , all very nice in they own way , clean , with good to great food , no complaint .<ssssss>i travel with friend from work and we normally stay for two week .<ssssss>this year we husband decide that they would like to come with we , so we plan for a one week vacation instead of two week .<ssssss>thank god we do !!!<ssssss>arrival : upon arrival at the resort -lrb- 11:30 be -rrb- we be greet with a tropical drink , and a cold welcome facecloth .<ssssss>at check-in we be tell that we would not be able to get we room until 3:00 pm , a real pain but this sometimes happen in the dominican .<ssssss>we come prepare for the delay , and wait for the buffet to open for lunch .<ssssss>so donâ€™t expect to get you room until 3 .<ssssss>the staff at check-in be friendly and accommodate with we , however this be not the case with other folk .<ssssss>other check in have problem with the resort overbooking and we witness many angry people .<ssssss>i donâ€™t understand how a resort overbooks once they have confirmation of a clientâ€™s reservation .<ssssss>the travel agency have to start take responsibility for this .<ssssss>no one should have to start a vacation on such a sour note.rooms : we be in build three overlook the pool/beach , so we have one of the good view .<ssssss>we room be adjoining which be nice , and all in all not that bad , a little tired but the resort be in the middle of renovate .<ssssss>there be trouble with the air conditioner , but once report they come the next day .<ssssss>for the entire week we do not receive we clean towel until 5:00 pm or later , which make it impossible to bathe before dinner .<ssssss>facecloth and hand towel be a luxury and most of the time we have none .<ssssss>apparently the resort have a shortage of linen .<ssssss>food : i donâ€™t have a lot of good thing to say on this subject .<ssssss>there be four aâ€™laâ€™carts which can be book at the same time instead of daily ; american/texmex one restaurant with terrible food , hardly edible , poor service , staff not very friendly.seafood ; food be good , again service not great , staff seem very unhappy.italian ; the best they have to offer , we eat there twice and the staff be always friendly .<ssssss>donâ€™t let the beef dish in the buffet turn you off in this restaurant as the beef be a real treat.japanese ; never eat there , as we feel that a all inclusive should not charge and we refuse to pay $ 15.00 per person for a meal.buffet ; the food be the same all week , breakfast be about the best , good omelet and bacon -lrb- when they have it -rrb- with a nice selection of bread .<ssssss>lunch and dinner be the same thing all week , not much taste , and many many fly all around the dining room .<ssssss>i have be to other resort where they have a open buffet , this one be close in and i think there be more insect there then anywhere else .<ssssss>dessert be very sad , nothing like other resort , again very little taste , and the same selection .<ssssss>on a good note the staff be the friendliest and always serve you with a smile .<ssssss>beach : the resort be situate next to natura park and be probably on the worst section of bavaro beach , a lot of seaweed , even though the staff be good at rake it up daily , the water wasnâ€™t as clear or clean as iâ€™ve see at other resort and there be a lot of boat anchor all over the beach area .<ssssss>the beach need cleaning , as garbage and glass be lie around .<ssssss>the only person we see do anything be a boy pick up the cup and take they back to the bar .<ssssss>we walk up the beach -lrb- about a couple of mile -rrb- and the two resort next door werenâ€™t any better .<ssssss>however , the water be lovely and warm so we certainly take advantage of the beach , but it could have be a lot cleaner .<ssssss>entertainment : where do i startâ€?we arrive on saturday so the first show be the highly anticipate â€œMichael jacksonâ€?show , music be good , as it be original and the dancing be great .<ssssss>they apparently contract with a group that travel from resort to resort with the same show , they be not on staff .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t know this at the time and think great good entertainment , next night be the caribbean show , terrible dancing , all they do be scream through the show , not much entertainment and people be actually leave .<ssssss>this be the same night after night , people leave before the show end it be terrible .<ssssss>on a good note they have some nice music and dance for the child .<ssssss>grounds/pools : beautiful , mature tree , and flower , nice layout for a small resort .<ssssss>not very many maintenance man clean up the dead palm or plant , they need more staff , as the place could have be cleaner .<ssssss>pool be nice , large main pool with a swim-up bar along with various section in the pool for play volleyball , swimming , or just sit around enjoy the jet .<ssssss>there be two other pool , which be located between building make they rather lengthy but nice and quiet for swimming .<ssssss>there be also a adult pool which we see but never swim in .<ssssss>my only complaint about the pool be that i never see any maintenance or cleaning of the main pool the entire time i be there .<ssssss>remember my room be overlook the pool , so youâ€™d think i would have see some chemical be add especially to a swim-up bar pool.unwelcomed visitor : this be certainly not my favorite subject , but one i feel be necessary .<ssssss>this resort have very large cockroach , crawl around .<ssssss>i didnâ€™t see any in the room , â€œthank godâ€?but they be by the bar and casino .<ssssss>they also have rat , not mouse , but big rat .<ssssss>now i donâ€™t know about you , but i didnâ€™t feel like i should pay a good sum to see rat .<ssssss>i be not foolish , i know rat be mainly around food area , but these one be see by the pool and by the building where we stay .<ssssss>i have never encounter rat before and pray i wonâ€™t again .<ssssss>i believe the trouble with this resort be due to the location .<ssssss>it be right off the main street , where the garbage be all over , housing for the local be located about 300 foot from the resort and there be a major sewage problem outside off the resort .<ssssss>nice welcome !!!<ssssss>conclusion : i feel we didnâ€™t make a good choice this year but we certainly didnâ€™t let the resort spoil we time .<ssssss>if you have already book you trip go with this knowledge but make the best of it , as you be the one who will lose out in the end .<ssssss>if you be shop around for a resort , be aware of what i say , it be the truth , i have nothing to gain by write this review .<ssssss>we all learn from we mistake and hopefully this wonâ€™t happen to we again .<ssssss>if you be in you thirty or younger you may not mind this resort , as there be lot of young people around have a great time .<ssssss>my husband and i , along with we friend be in we fifty and we like to have a resort that be cleaner , friendlier , with more feature .<ssssss>the grand oasis be a small resort , with a casino , three bar , one by the beach , one in the theater and one locate by the main pool , a theatre , spa , fitness centre , internet , and several small very expensive shop .<ssssss>if you have any question please email I and i will try to answer they .<ssssss>

4 4 4 5 5 5 5 2		great location in san francisco i have very mixed feeling about petite auberge -lrb- stay 6 night -rrb- .<ssssss>there be much to love and a few thing that just should not be at this kind of property .<ssssss>first the positive : great staff - very helpful front desk , service at the wine reception and breakfast be great and we housekeeper be absolutely delightful .<ssssss>the afternoon wine and nibbly be great and breakfast be the best we have during we 3 week in northern california .<ssssss>the neutral : we have one of the smaller room -lrb- cosy queen -rrb- and it be adaquate but nothing special -lrb- rather basic -rrb- .<ssssss>for such a great location , the value be good by have the smaller room .<ssssss>now the negative : the biggest be the internet service .<ssssss>petite auberge be the only property that charge for internet service -lrb- $ 7.99 / night -rrb- on we 3 week in northern california .<ssssss>this be not disclose -lrb- that i saw -rrb- on the web site .<ssssss>at a property of this stature , i feel that this be a bit cheesy .<ssssss>the second issue be that many room face the back alley .<ssssss>because night in sf , even in the summer be quite cool , have the window open be a delight .<ssssss>-lsb- btw - i do not see a/c availability in the room but it might have be - open window be great -rsb- .<ssssss>in the back alley , every morning around 5 a.m. be the garbage pickup .<ssssss>for about 10 min .<ssssss>there be quite a racket that you will not sleep through .<ssssss>so if you have a back alley room and do not have the window close and the heat on , i would inquire about the a/c and if available use it .<ssssss>
3 4 5 5 5 4 2 5		good location near beach and marina this be a newly build hotel in barcelona near the marina and beach area .<ssssss>the room be fabulous and the bathroom very spacious with separate bath and shower , however we have problem with the temperature of the water be too cold .<ssssss>we complain but it take they nearly another 12 hour to fix it , the tap with the thermostat need to be replace .<ssssss>the hotel do not offer anything extra to we due to this problem which for a 5 * very much annoyed I , as we be only there for 3 day .<ssssss>the two swimming pool be fabulous , one be on the roof overlook the beach .<ssssss>one of the porter be most friendly to we - he speak to the maintenance person in english regard the water .<ssssss>location be good and metro be just across the road , to walk along the beach and marina be very closeby and also the casino be around the corner , near all the lovely restaurant .<ssssss>breakfast be include in we deal , but when we be check out they try to charge we , we have to ask for the manager and nearly miss we bus to the airport .<ssssss>all in all it be a good hotel - but i suppose it have teething problem be new , however they should look after they visitor better if they want more to come back !<ssssss>
3 4 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		great beach , nicely landscaped resort , but ... .<ssssss>nicely landscaped pool .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 4 2 4 -1		shaky start , but good overall i stay here with my 3 teenage kid for the last few day of dec. room be pay for up front and very expensive -lrb- more than $ 600/night -rrb- we be promise early check-in since we have a very early flight that arrive before 8 be .<ssssss>room be not ready when we arrive , but promise by noon .<ssssss>we be dissapoint that it be not ready at noon , tell to come back at 2 pm , when we do , the room be still not available .<ssssss>the person at the front desk tell we i could get hot chocolate for my kid at the resturant bar , but the bartender could not be bother with we !<ssssss>-lrb- he actually tell we it would be too much trouble -rrb- we be so tired and the lobby be tiny , but we sit there for another hour and a half before we be give access to we room .<ssssss>the room be nice enough , but not spacious .<ssssss>there be hair in the tub and hairclip leave on the bar area - not a big deal , but for $ 600 a night , the room should be spotless !<ssssss>after i complain , they do send housekeeping up to clean the tub and later they send up a bottle of wine.on the positive side , the location of this hotel be incredible - right in the middle of everything .<ssssss>we see several play and go to rockefeller center , etc. , and everything be just a short walk .<ssssss>on new year 's eve , the staff take extra precaution to make sure only register guest be enter the hotel and they also secure a small area right outside the hotel door where you could comfortably watch the action .<ssssss>we room be on a higher floor , so street noise be not much of a problem and the view be great .<ssssss>the bathroom be spacious and attractive .<ssssss>linen on the bed be wonderful .<ssssss>the on site resturant have a great view of time square , but be pricey .<ssssss>housekeeping do a great job keep the room tidy and well stock with soap and towel .<ssssss>the conceige be kind and helpful , but the best part of this hotel be amos the doorman , who cheer we up every time we run into him.i would probably prefer to stay at the marquis which have much bigger room , and a full service lobby , but would definately stay here again .<ssssss>
2 3 4 4 5 2 2 1		the bad weather be one of the better occurance do not get I wrong , we trip to the dominican be not all bad , and we do have some very wonderful time , but overall the trip leave we drain and annoy .<ssssss>i do not mean to complain about everything , but i would have appreciate know about the bad stuff before stay at this resort .<ssssss>my boyfriend and i do extensive research before we leave , but we be not prepare for staff that seem to look right through we when we need help ; a total lack of beach chair , then a near fist fight with a very irrate german man over one that we have originally reserve ; and meal time that be inconsistent -lrb- nowhere to eat for 2 hour stretch -rrb- .<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 5 3 5 -1		good !<ssssss>my husband and i go per 4 days.he have a conference and we be really disappointed about the distance between the hotel and the conference center -lrb- they say it be close ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>however the place be gorgeous , there be a lot of shop and restaurant .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i love the one on the beach .<ssssss>.<ssssss>-lrb- good simple pizza !! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>they give you free towel and there be the possibility to rent everything you can need on the beach .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the sea in front of the hotel be great and warm.the room be really clean , big and with the security box .<ssssss>there be also a very nice staff : i leave my i-pod inside the security box , and , after 3 day from the check out , i call the hotel and they find it and give it back !<ssssss>.<ssssss>.<ssssss>very nice!the hula lesson be nice , but to do just once .<ssssss>
5 4 5 3 5 3 3 5		love the bed !<ssssss>my colleague book this hotel for a convention at the la convention center .<ssssss>and i think she pay about $ 130 per night from fri - mon , 3 night stay.the entrance and lobby be relatively small , but i think it be typical of hotel locate in busy business district like downtown la .<ssssss>since we stay there on the weekend , there be several parties/events/gathering at they meeting facility , and the lobby/entrance staff seem more busy accommodate they over they hotel guests.our room be on 17th floor , which have a lounge area where they serve daily continental breakfast .<ssssss>they also serve complimentary wine and some snack in the evening and the room have 2 internet ready computer for the guest for free.room be very clean , simple , and modern .<ssssss>i really like they bed , mattress , choice of pillow , and a down comforter especially since i be somewhat particular about my sleep environment.the hotel be located in a strange spot .<ssssss>there be nothing else around the hotel that i be willing to walk to at night .<ssssss>we always take a cab to get to place like a sushi restaurant in little tokyo , california pizza kitchen , and roy 's .<ssssss>cab be hard to get to find we way back to the hotel on weekend nights.overall , it be a nice stay .<ssssss>i might find a hotel that be closer to stores/restaurants on my next visit .<ssssss>thing might have be very different if it be not for the weekend stay .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 3 4 5 2		stay away little more than a motel with price that match many of the big , beautiful hotel , this be the biggest disappointment of we trip .<ssssss>the room be small and smell mildewy .<ssssss>the only positive be the staff who be friendly and accomodate .<ssssss>
4 5 5 3 2 5 -1 -1		very nice apex stay at apex for 2 night in january 2008 , and on the overall , we have a very good stay.location be good though not central , but tube be only 5 min .<ssssss>walk away and will bring you anywhere you need .<ssssss>tower of london also 5 min .<ssssss>away , and the city be worth a visit for both contemporary architecture and old neighbourhood lovers.the positive be the staff , always very friendly .<ssssss>hotel be very contemporary chic , sleek design , although not cold .<ssssss>we have a deluxe room on the corner of the building with 3 window on 2 wall overlook the city -lrb- 5th floor -rrb- ... lovely view at night !<ssssss>room very spacious -lrb- king size bed , sofa , coffee table , big closet , desk area , nice decoration item -rrb- , bathroom also big -lrb- tub , separate walk-in shower -rrb- .<ssssss>much more space than what you usually get in london for that price , it really have a little my own studio feeling attach to it .<ssssss>all amenity such as kettle , tea , coffee , iron , iron board , very nice closet with lot of shelf , hanger , drawer , nice toiletries and lovely apex rubber duck in the bathroom .<ssssss>tv and dvd player , nice selection of dvd 's avaialble for free at the reception .<ssssss>the big plus , the small fridge in the room .<ssssss>not a minibar , a fridge , empty , where you can store you wine and food from m to have it at hand for a cosy aperitif after a long day before hit the town again !<ssssss>on a less positive note , the cleaning , though ok on the overall , be not perfect : dust on all frame , on the bedside lamp .<ssssss>.<ssssss>nothing dirty , but give it a odd impression for a 4 star ... also we could hear a lot of noise from water run even in the middle of the night -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>, the airco system be also quite noisy and always blow cold , even if you put it on 25 Â° ... can not comment on bar , restaurant or room service as we always eat outside or bring everything back with we from m -lrb- 5 minute walk -rrb- .<ssssss>so all in all , i definitely recommend apex for the room space , the nice decor , the real chic atmosphere and elegant feeling of it .<ssssss>
4 3 4 3 5 3 3 1		good but not great !<ssssss>.<ssssss>bed<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 2 3 3 1		positively awful i be book in this hotel by a company recruiter and be appal by the condition of this hotel .<ssssss>i do not mind the room be small but the fact that the carpet be filthy , the dark layer of scum in the bathtub , the mold on the bathroom ceiling , peel wallpaper , and blacken window be enough to make I rate this place terrible .<ssssss>i would never stay at any of these establishment again nor would i recommend anyone to stay there .<ssssss>the staff be friendly but when i ask if there be a room that have possibly be renovate more recently i be tell they be all do at the same time .<ssssss>fortunately , i be there for two night .<ssssss>while i seriously consider change hotel it be not worth the effort for such a short stay .<ssssss>
2 4 3 5 3 2 1 -1		great location but average service pick this hotel for the location and because we trust novotel 's reputation .<ssssss>although the location part be great , the service standard be not what we have expect from a novotel .<ssssss>the good : subway station right outside hotel , which get you on subway line 2 .<ssssss>the only down side be major shopping area -lrb- such as xidan , silk market , wanfujing -rrb- , and major attraction -lrb- such as forbid city , tienanmen square -rrb- be on line 1 , so change line be often need .<ssssss>we stay at a standard room in the back part of the hotel , it be not as nice as the new part , but be still clean , roomy , and comfortable -lrb- except for the really hard bed -rrb- .<ssssss>2 bottle of water be provide free each day .<ssssss>the average : breakfast price at the hotel be expensive for china , so try to get a deal where it be include in you room package .<ssssss>if not , there be a really clean and good quality bread shop across the road , so we eat there at breakfast time .<ssssss>the bad : service be below average .<ssssss>at check in , staff be slow , we paperwork change hand whilst other behind we push in .<ssssss>one of the girl at the ticket desk be extremely rude , and unhelpful .<ssssss>would often rather talk on she phone than answer question , therefore be difficult to get help on domestic air ticket -lrb- so we book we flight with china travel next to the hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>most people at the concierge desk be also uninterested and unhelpful , which mean get direction to major attraction be difficult , so plan you trip well , know where you want to go , and just use they to confirm you destination , or to write the address down in chinese for the taxi driver .<ssssss>overall : we would stay there again , but would not expect great service .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 5 4 1		family vacation we just spend 5 day at excellence at punta cana .<ssssss>most of the people who work at the hotel be very pleasant .<ssssss>jackeline at the desk , ramon , a server , libeth , a hostess , edwardo , a bell person , christian a server at the beach , be exceptional .<ssssss>the staff be clearly well trained always say ola and smile and make room for you in the hall way and such .<ssssss>the food be not outstanding , but , plentiful and good enough with spice and the barcelona restaurant be the best .<ssssss>the wine be decent .<ssssss>the nightly entertainment be nice , but after 3 night a bit of the same thing .<ssssss>the pool be extraordinary in that one really can just roll along on float nearly the length of the hotel with curve and island and a swim-up bar .<ssssss>the beach front be magnificent .<ssssss>the water be pristine , the temperature perfect with enough wave to have fun and little tidal pool to make a more timid swimmer feel comfortable .<ssssss>the horseback ride be awesome ; it be a nice ride through a wooded area and along the beach .<ssssss>the spa be nice .<ssssss>the marine-scrub massage with esmeralda be great , but a facial be not worth the $ $ $ .<ssssss>the hotel have a open feeling that be very clean and attractive .<ssssss>the room be spacious , very clean with very firm bed .<ssssss>some little thing i notice : a lamp do not work ; a small chip on the counter ; stuff to make coffee , but no coffee maker .<ssssss>they be quickly ameliorate if you call the front desk .<ssssss>internet service be not available in the room and barely in the lobby area .<ssssss>this hotel be a hour from the airport .<ssssss>the ride be not pleasant with lot of pot hole and poor road .<ssssss>departure be a bit of a experience ; one line after another with hour of standing .<ssssss>despite that , it be nice to be away from hotel row .<ssssss>you can easily stay 4-5 day here with all the activity , restaurant , beach and bar and have a lovely , relax vacation.tips be greatly appreciate despite this be all inclusive .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 4 2 2 5		clean and quiet this hotel be definitly gear to the business traveler , we be there on pleasure .<ssssss>check in and check out be slow due to problem with the automated system and they do not have the desk staff to handle everyone manually .<ssssss>this be one of the quietest hotel i have ever stay in which be much appreciate as i be a light sleeper .<ssssss>the bathroom be too small for 2 people to use at the same time .<ssssss>the room be small but not especially for boston .<ssssss>while the business traveller will appreciate the wireless connection , etc. for the pleasure traveller the room feel strip down .<ssssss>we get a good deal through priceline , but when i call to make sure i have a non smoking room , the person give I attitude about book through priceline .<ssssss>also the number for the hotel be list incorrectly -lrb- i be assume it be a incorrect number since it ring and ring and no one answer -rrb- .<ssssss>it take some detective work to find the real number.in the future i will limit myself to 4 star .<ssssss>

the resort , it be very impressive .<ssssss>at check in there be no line and immediate .<ssssss>i ask for a top floor room and get the 3rd floor .<ssssss>4 be the top .<ssssss>next i inquire about the phone card that you could buy in the lobby and use on the lobby phone .<ssssss>they say they dont do that anymore .<ssssss>they offer I to use a booth next to the front desk and charge 2.50 per minute .<ssssss>i make 2 short call back to the we cost 6.00 .<ssssss>i think that be fair .<ssssss>next they bring I to my room .<ssssss>it be extraordinary and very clean .<ssssss>nice furniture and marble .<ssssss>probably one of the nicest hotel room i have ever have .<ssssss>however , i be toward the front of the hotel , close to the lobby , and have to really look hard to the right to see the water .<ssssss>below be a access path that be make out of brick that constantly carry employee with cart to and from the resort make noise .<ssssss>tv work well with many channel in english .<ssssss>nice jet tub with shower and two sink .<ssssss>mini bar be stock but the fridge in the room do not get cold .<ssssss>i iced down one of the sink for cold beer .<ssssss>i do like the brahma beer they have .<ssssss>its a pilsner and be good when ice cold .<ssssss>also one of the chair on the balcony keep come apart .<ssssss>the arm keep come out of the socket .<ssssss>i use the other one .<ssssss>i do notice the hard bed .<ssssss>however the sheet pillow and blanket be wonderful!my biggest problem with this place be there be no way to lock the front door to keep out the maid or drink re-stocker .<ssssss>the 1st night i be there i use the do not disturb sign and keep it on the door thru the next morning .<ssssss>i have breakfast and then go to the orientation with the gogo tour guy .<ssssss>come back to the room and get ready for the beach .<ssssss>i guess the maid didnt like the fact that i have the sign on the door the whole morning .<ssssss>because , when they clean the room that morning she take the sign and leave another clean room as soon as possible sign .<ssssss>why would i need two of these ???<ssssss>the next morning i get up and to the beach early .<ssssss>i leave a note for the maid to replace the do not disturb sign .<ssssss>she do not .<ssssss>after the day be over i come back to my room and my note be go but there be still 2 clean room sign hang on the door .<ssssss>i didnt do anything more about it that evening .<ssssss>the next morning at about 9 am , i be asleep and the maid knock on the door .<ssssss>i say go away but she come right in and say hola , oh you sleeping .<ssssss>duh ... well after that i get up and take a shower .<ssssss>i be wear a towel get clothes to put on and then the drink re-stocker decide to come in .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i tell he to go away .<ssssss>he ask dont you want I to re-stock you fridge ?<ssssss>i say no and think , not while i be naked .<ssssss>after go to the beach and get back to the room , it have be clean but the fridge didnt get re-stocked .<ssssss>i go to the front desk that evening and request i get the propper sign to hang on the door !<ssssss>they have one there after i get back from dinner .<ssssss>also the next day , the re-stocker guy only leave I 2 beer .<ssssss>i guess he didnt like I tell he to go away .<ssssss>that be the only time they come in on I but i use my sign continuously .<ssssss>that doesnt keep they from yell at each other outside you door wake you up at early hour .<ssssss>they could be quieter and not yell and slam door at 9 am .<ssssss>after a late night , you want to sleep in , this be vacation right?ok , enough of that , let I go back to some of the positive .<ssssss>the beach be one of the best i have ever be to .<ssssss>i like the shipwreck off the coast in front of the resort .<ssssss>the sand be nice with plenty of shade or sun whatever you prefer at the moment .<ssssss>i have nice weather every day with a little rain a couple of night .<ssssss>the food for dinner at the buffet be pretty good .<ssssss>i do not like wear long pants for dinner .<ssssss>if you go out walk at night afterwards , you would get pretty sweaty wear they .<ssssss>i could not wait to put shorts back on after i eat .<ssssss>i try to eat healthy , fish , veggy , etc. breakfast be need a little help though .<ssssss>the dish of scramble egg be more like soup .<ssssss>sometimes the bacon look like it be still move .<ssssss>i like mine cook !<ssssss>i like hash brown for breakfast , not french fries .<ssssss>but i didnt really come here to gorge myself ... i really enjoy the sport bar .<ssssss>i do not pay the 3 dollar that it cost to play pool .<ssssss>i guess if it be free , nobody would get to play it would be too busy .<ssssss>also one night i get there and order a margarita .<ssssss>very yummy ... but when the bartender ask I if i want another , i sad no and switch to beer .<ssssss>i about fall off my stool when she take the lime from my used glass and put it back in the container where it come from !!!<ssssss>wow !<ssssss>i didnt lick it so i guess it be ok .<ssssss>lol !<ssssss>i do not try the 24 hour snack that be in the fridge .<ssssss>be too scared .<ssssss>i do try the slot in there for 20 buck .<ssssss>they dont seem to pay out much but i be not suprise .<ssssss>note , i be just in vegas 2 month ago.the first time i go to the pool , i burnt my foot walk to it .<ssssss>i figure out after that to wear flip-flop to the edge and then get in .<ssssss>it be too warm .<ssssss>i only use it only a little .<ssssss>i like the beach much better .<ssssss>which bring I to another problem .<ssssss>i use a cooler cup at the beach to keep my beverage cold and plentiful .<ssssss>that be nice and work well the first four day .<ssssss>the 5th day i go down and ask the pool bartender to fill it with diet pepsi , he look at I and say the problem with that be , we have people who deliver diet pepsi to you on the beach .<ssssss>i say it have not be a problem until now ??<ssssss>he proceed to go ahead and fill my cup .<ssssss>then say salute .<ssssss>i make it to my beach chair to find he fill it with orange drink .<ssssss>it be ok but he know what i want !<ssssss>i think this place be all inclusive ?<ssssss>can they not spare a cup of soda ?<ssssss>i guess not since they recycle the limes!let I add that most of the people work she be very nice .<ssssss>i even tip some of they .<ssssss>just a couple of they take I off guard ... i do not do any excursion off the resort .<ssssss>i figure i have pay enough to stay there .<ssssss>i do catch the michael jackson show at the macao next door .<ssssss>that be good .<ssssss>the other show i see be back at my resort .<ssssss>they be good with the guest be participent .<ssssss>that be funny and make I laugh .<ssssss>however , one of the show , they lip-sink the whole thing .<ssssss>i do not make it till the end ... pretty bad .<ssssss>something definatly worth see , be the view down the beach to the north .<ssssss>its a good walk but well worth it !<ssssss>take a leave out of the resort and go until the bend in the beach .<ssssss>i just want to see what be on the other side .<ssssss>i make the mistake of not bring a camera ... very breathtaking with the mountain in the background!i do buy a t-shirt in one of the shop for 10 dollar ... think that be a good deal .<ssssss>i do not try any of the ala cart restaurant .<ssssss>i wish i have but didnt want to deal with the wait that morning or have any schedule to meet .<ssssss>i be please with the dinner buffet anyway .<ssssss>ok , on to leave now .<ssssss>yesterday morning when pack my suitcase , i notice someone have break the strap on top that carry another attach bag ... this could have be american airline , but i do not notice it pick it up at the airport .<ssssss>the bus driver take it from I and give it to the bellman at the resort .<ssssss>the bellman bring it to my room and put it on the shelf and it stay there the whole time .<ssssss>oh-well .<ssssss>this be only the second time i have use this suitcase , it be new !<ssssss>they obviously pick it up with the strap instead of use the handle .<ssssss>the plastic buckle break and you know whoever do it know they do it !<ssssss>of course , they be not go to let you know .<ssssss>when leave i let the other bellman take my bag to store until my ride arrive .<ssssss>i

3 3 3 4 3 4 3 1		reasonable value for money hotel in sf be not cheap , and room size be not overly big , so a pretty tiny room for $ 180 be no big surprise .<ssssss>valet parking for $ 40 per night seem a bit steep , but at least the service be efficient and quick.overall the tuscan inn be a nice hotel .<ssssss>very clean , well maintain , with efficient , if not overly friendly service .<ssssss>the couple of fault with room feature be fix very quickly , which be a nice change from the interminable wait often suffer in european properties.the hotel make a big thing of the coffee/bisc service in the morning , and this be quite nice .<ssssss>i would say that , as far as the evening -lrb- 5 to 6 -rrb- wine service be concern , if you happen to be in the hotel , it be fine .<ssssss>but not worth rush back from a day out for.breakfast be ok , but expensive .<ssssss>much better option be pats cafe , just round the corner nr the cable car terminus .<ssssss>

4 5 4 5 5 5 4 2		nice but a bit sterile , with smaller room i stay in the tokyo park hotel at shiodome -lrb- not to be confuse with several other park hotel -rrb- for 6 night on business .<ssssss>as other review note , it can be difficult to find if arrive by cab -lrb- the road be very complex and under construction -rrb- or by train -lrb- the train station/office complex be huge -rrb- .<ssssss>best bet for arrival be by limousine bus from the airport.the entire hotel , from lobby to restaurant to guest room and bathroom be beautiful and immaculately clean .<ssssss>it no doubt help that the hotel be only 3 year old .<ssssss>the room be well design and quiet , and have especially nice attention to amenity in the bathroom .<ssssss>bed be very comfortable and there be excellent attention to lighting control in the rooms.the location in the shiodome area be very convenient for easy transportation to almost everything in tokyo -lrb- or outside tokyo , for that matter -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel connect directly to the shiodome station for toeus -lrb- newer , private -rrb- subway line and the yurikomome elevated train to odaiba ; and it be a 10 minute enclose walk to the shimbashi station for tokyo metro subway and jr station -lrb- yamanote line as well as several other line , e.g. , to kamakura -rrb- .<ssssss>it be only a few minute by train to tokyo station for the bullet train .<ssssss>as other have mention , it be also about a 15 minute walk to ginza , tsukiji fish market , etc.the downside of the location be that take a cab to the hotel be quite difficult .<ssssss>it be essential to pick up one of they map card to show the driver .<ssssss>also , the shiodome complex be sterile -- full of office building and chain store .<ssssss>although the enclosed nature of it be convenient when hot or rainy , it can also be claustrophobic , like live in a shopping mall.you may be wonder : why be the hotel so much less expensive than other top hotel in tokyo , especially since it be new and beautiful ?<ssssss>i think there be two reason : the room be relatively small for a luxury hotel , and the hotel provide relatively few service , compare to 5-star hotel .<ssssss>the regular room with king bed allow very little room apart from the bed .<ssssss>i stay in a upgrade corner room which have a separate small sit area , but it be still fairly crowd , even for just one person .<ssssss>it would be fine for two people , but would probably feel quite small if a child be add -lrb- and would be impossible for more than 3 -rrb- .<ssssss>on the other hand , you be likely not to spend a lot of time in the room anyway .<ssssss>one thing to remember , though , be that extra room be very nice when one or more family member suffer jet lag and wake at 4:00 am.as for service , there be many thing the hotel do not have : a fitness center , a pool , business service -lrb- apart from a couple of computer -rrb- , a variety of restaurant -lrb- only two -rrb- , etc. those thing be probably of main concern to business traveler .<ssssss>for instance , i need to make more business card , which they could not do , unlike other hotel i have visit in tokyo.finally , the open atrium style architecture of the hotel -lrb- a 10-story high open central space -rrb- be dramatic and lovely , but it have a drawback -- one feel as if on display .<ssssss>eat at the main breakfast area in the lobby , one sit at the bottom of the open area .<ssssss>all sound be magnify by the echo chamber effect and the hard wooden floor .<ssssss>i feel like i should not talk -lrb- it echo all over -rrb- and must walk quietly .<ssssss>when i drop a umbrella , it resound loudly throughout the restaurant area .<ssssss>-lrb- fwiw , a better place to sit for breakfast be in one of the side room , which also have view -rrb- .<ssssss>so it definitely could feel awkward come or go through the lobby with boisterous children.in short , be it a good deal ?<ssssss>absolutely .<ssssss>be it a good location ?<ssssss>yes , very much , as long as you get out of the shiodome complex .<ssssss>if travel alone , i would be happy to stay there again .<ssssss>however , it be not really fair -lrb- or the intention of the hotel -rrb- to be compare against five star hotel with complete range of service and spacious room .<ssssss>

4 2 4 5 4 3 3 -1		clean room and efficient service my first impression be that the lobby staff be highly efficient and professional .<ssssss>btw this be hong kong so do not expect the same warmth and friendliness that you normally get in other asian city like singapore , kuala lumpur , jakarta or bangkok .<ssssss>but i would not rate they badly for this coldness as efficiency can be a very welcome trait for a harry traveler .<ssssss>just manage you expectation to suit they local culture and you will be fine.a warning though , there be no free breakfast offer .<ssssss>there be a breakfast buffett but this will cost you .<ssssss>i have never stay in a hotel where there be no free breakfast service before so i feel i be be rip off .<ssssss>they also take they time with my luggage .<ssssss>i be want to carry up my suitcase myself but they * insist * on take it .<ssssss>so fine .<ssssss>it be close to midnight and i be tire so i let they , not expect it to be a problem .<ssssss>all i want to do be shower , change and sleep .<ssssss>but because they take my luggage , i end up sit in my room with the same clothes on as i be wear on the flight for 20 minute before they finally deliver my suitcase .<ssssss>i do not get the logic of this .<ssssss>if this happen to you , insist to carry you own luggage up !<ssssss>there be lift to every floor so there be no problem at all logistically .<ssssss>at first i think this be the way for they to squeeze a tip from the guest .<ssssss>so i have my money out when the knock come but the guy who bring it in turn tail out the door without even pause .<ssssss>so its not the tip then ?<ssssss>* scratch head * apart from this minor annoyance , my stay be good in overall .<ssssss>the good : the room be clean and neat .<ssssss>good size bathroom .<ssssss>comfortable bed .<ssssss>cable television .<ssssss>a view of the harbour .<ssssss>effficient and professional staff .<ssssss>in the room , there be a electric kettle to boil water with .<ssssss>the bad : no free wifus .<ssssss>no free breakfast .<ssssss>strange insistence to take my bag when i check in be a waste of my time .<ssssss>

3 2 2 -1 5 -1 5 -1		four season vs mandarin four season benefit : - better pool area - better fitness center -lrb- it be a full-scale health club -rrb- - amazing brunch mandarin benefit : - private man-made beach - better design room - better restaurant -lrb- variety service -rrb- - less urban feelat both place the staff be superb and the room be spotless and well appoint .<ssssss>i stay at the four season last weekend and find the room to be a bit ` standard issue . '<ssssss>the mandarin seem like it be a purpose-built hotel , the four season feel like a hotel stick inside a multi-purpose office tower -lrb- which it be -rrb- .<ssssss>both be good place to stay and a lot come down to personal preference , but i would have to say i would give the mandarin the edge up in this case .<ssssss>
5 3 5 2 5 5 5 5		excellent the location be not the best -lrb- olympic port , pretty far away from most of the sight -rrb- and it be hard to love the building .<ssssss>otherwise , this be a very well run luxury hotel .<ssssss>i have a suite , and it be one of the best room i have have in a city hotel .<ssssss>restaurant , shop facility , fitness , pool and spa be all first rate .<ssssss>

1 1 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		awful hotel : mold , noise , cockroach yes , this hotel be cheap and , yes , it have a interesting courtyard , but i can not recommend stay there.it have the feel of a prison - or maybe that be just the fact that it use to be a convent : very basic room , my one have no window , high and narrow door and constant noise.my room have black mold on the bathroom ceiling and smell awful .<ssssss>the mold form black chain which hang down from the ceiling .<ssssss>i feel soil and dirty just be in the room.on top of this , the noise be constant .<ssssss>the wall be paper-thin and you can hear everything , and i mean everything , that be go on , not just in adjacent room but in the hotel as a whole .<ssssss>forget sleep - you be not go to get any.luckily i never experienced bedbug but certainly cockroach scurry around in the bathroom.after about 8 am , forget hot water .<ssssss>the strange thing be it do not just turn cold - nothing come out of the tap at all.all together , i feel sullied staying in this hotel .<ssssss>it be one of the worst hotel i have ever stay in .<ssssss>horrible !<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 1 3 2 1		not as bad as people make out this be a good hotel to stay in if there 5 or 6 of you and you dont mind what its like aslong as theres clean sheet and a shower , we stay for 3 night and never encounter the dreaded bed bug or any mouse , even though there be food on the floor for 3 day straight , we room wasnt clean once but we do get clean towel when we ask , we have no problem bring people up to the room either at all hour of the night .<ssssss>so if you goin away for a few day with a group of people on a bit of a session then the hotel manofa be perfect , i would not recommend it for anything else though .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 3 4 4 -1		good location , average hotel if you be after this particular location then the vibe be adequate , but there be not much to recommend about the accomodation itself base on my room.vibe hotel be in a top location in milson 's point .<ssssss>it be a short walk to the base of the sydney harbour bridge and spectacular view across the water to the opera house and city .<ssssss>this would be a good location if you need quick access to the city but want to stay somewhere more relaxing and quiet .<ssssss>it be a short drive to the city or you can catch the train across from the hotel and be in the city in a few minute , and the train seem quite good in sydney .<ssssss>also , make sure you take the short walk across to kirribillus where you will find plenty of small shop and good eaterie -lrb- although slightly pricey as you would expect just a few hundred metre from such great view -rrb- .<ssssss>as for the vibe hotel itself , i find it very average .<ssssss>the restaurant and bar be ok , my bed be comfortable enough , and the room be quiet .<ssssss>some of the room would have good water view .<ssssss>however , my room look old and worn , the tv be small and old , and the bathroom be cramp .<ssssss>the shower design and position mean that i have to kneel under the shower head and get blast with cold water to turn the shower on .<ssssss>the worst part be the musty smell of my floor and room - although i realise later that i be in a smoking room , but surely it still should not smell that bad .<ssssss>the swimming pool be tiny.good location , average hotel .<ssssss>
3 5 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		good location , small room , good value , some smelly room room bathroom both small.great location for visit sf - not so busy like fisherman 's wharf but easy to get around to all attraction especially if you can use the buses.our first room have disgusting smell in it which i could still smell in the morning after sleep - you would have think after a while you nose would get use to it .<ssssss>inform reception and they arrange a new room which be identical layout but no bad smell.wine reception look very nice if you like that sort of thing .<ssssss>do not try continental breakfast.good value for sf - we pay $ 99 a night for 3 nights.probably would not go back cos i be particular about smell but maybe i be just fussy .<ssssss>smelly room be on 5th floor .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 3 3 3		a totally utilitarian hotel during the summer month -lrb- low season -rrb- many hotel in new orlean give discount .<ssssss>on a tourism webpage i find this hotel as advertise $ 99 for 2 night plus free valet .<ssssss>it work out perfect for I and my girlfriend as we be go to just walk around and party a bit .<ssssss>the catch be that you have to call the 800 number on the tourism website and let they book .<ssssss>do not forget to verify the free parking , ask they to put a note on the reservation about it .<ssssss>i wait a couple day and call the hotel directly for reservation verification .<ssssss>all be fine and they verify free parking .<ssssss>we arrive and staff be pleasant , bill be around $ 115 because of tax but parking be free .<ssssss>the room be totally utilitarian , four wall , no view , hot water , and cold ac .<ssssss>it be very noisy because hard wood floor and 15ft ceiling do carry the slightest sound .<ssssss>bed be kinda gross but we bring we own sheet and when it come down to it we really do not care after a night out on bourbon street .<ssssss>i recommend this place for college kid and low maintenance people .<ssssss>the price be right and we sleep soundly .<ssssss>

4 5 4 4 4 2 5 4		great trip overall the resort get high mark .<ssssss>as with any resort there be always something negative that can be say if you dig deep enough .<ssssss>but i wont worry anyone with any here since they would be minor and trivial .<ssssss>this be the review of 2 couple in the 26 - 31 age group.the food be good ; buffet have a good selection and there be so many a la carte restaurant to choose from if that be you cup of tee.the room be clean , no bug , and the bathroom have everything you need .<ssssss>what else could you ask for ?<ssssss>you on vacation people so hopefully you spending more time out of you room than in it.the beach ?<ssssss>this be punta cana , it be great !<ssssss>although i will say that i rate the bavaro beach -lrb- about 20 min away -rrb- higher .<ssssss>bavaro beach be where you will find the majority of hotel in the punta cana area .<ssssss>we beach be nice , and if you like secluded , this be you place as this cocotal -lrb- and it be sister hotel attach , tropical -rrb- be the only hotel here.the animacion -lrb- activity -rrb- be extremely friendly and they will get you participate in a bunch of activity whether you be young or old .<ssssss>most of the staff -lrb- wait and bar -rrb- and young and friendly.this hotel have visitor from across the globe and 2 great place to meet they be the lobby bar and the pool bar .<ssssss>we meet people from england , france , germany and from we native canada -lrb- bc and quebec -rrb- .<ssssss>i would rate meet all these different people as one of the best part of the trip.the best advice i can offer anyone use this site for advice on a hotel ; remember that these be individual opinion and everyone have a different one .<ssssss>i think that a positive or negative review can be either or simply on how much you pay for you trip .<ssssss>if i have pay $ 1200 for 1 week here i would probably be a bit disappointed -lrb- compare it to the bavaro princess where i stay previously -rrb- , but since i pay $ 680 then my review dramatically different.hopefully this review will help you .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 5 3 3 4		great place to stay !<ssssss>we return yesterday from a fabulous trip to the big apple !!<ssssss>four of we stay in the bwhh and share a 1 bedroom apartment .<ssssss>we have a main bedroom as well as a queen size sofa bed in the living room .<ssssss>the apartment be very clean and quite spacious compare to other nyc hotels.breakfast be leave in the kitchen on a daily basis consist of fresh bread , bagel , muffin , cereal , milk , tropicana juice and danish pastry .<ssssss>this be perfect as we could see to ourselves at a time that suit we .<ssssss>the hotel be a 10-15 minute stroll to time square , although we find so many other thing to look at along the way that it be more like 20 minute !!<ssssss>as other have say this hotel be in a great location for all midtown attraction and the subway be only 2 block away to get you to other area .<ssssss>reception could have be a little friendlier and although they be not rude , they be just not particularly chatty .<ssssss>i would definately recommend this place for the excellent rate that you can find on best western website and would be happy to stay here again !<ssssss>*** my husband and sister both recommend the pizza place next door , for a snack to bring back in to the hotel !<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 3 4 4 2		good value in a great location a good price and great location ; a five minute walk from fredrichstrasse railway station and just a tad more to the reichstag and brandenberg gate .<ssssss>ok small room , but fine for a few night stopover , comfy bed with fluffy duvet and pillow , and yes the shower flood the room - just dont use it on full power !<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be more than adequate and provide a very acceptable start to the day - and a big coffee pot cheerful serve by the young , enthusiastic staff!don ' t go expect too much and you will be satisfy with a quite acceptable standard for bed breakfast in a great location at a affordable price !<ssssss>
3 2 4 4 4 3 3 2		not as good as i think ... my partner and i stay here just last week and i be not as impressed as i think i would be .<ssssss>the hotel itself be okay and in a good location - lot of bus etc and only a 30 min walk to fisherman 's wharf - where you can book you tour for alcatraz etc. the guy on the front desk be very nice when we arrive and we room be okay .<ssssss>however , we have the same problem as when we be in hawaii , we be place right round the corner of the lift so could hear they churn around all the time !<ssssss>we also have a view of the main road which be not great -lrb- we be on the 14th floor -rrb- .<ssssss>we room be clean every day so that be good .<ssssss>shower be not as powerful as most hotel - it seem like we be each in there for about 45 minute every day !<ssssss>we ask about a courtesy room for the thursday we check out as we flight be not until 10pm , the woman say there be then when we ask that same night to book it -lrb- think this be the wed -rrb- a different woman say there be not !!<ssssss>very bizarre !<ssssss>she say we could keep we room on until 6pm at a cost of $ 50 -lrb- Â£25 -rrb- i think this be pretty expensive but my partner want to keep it on so we do .<ssssss>overall , it be a okay hotel but a bit noisy for the 3 day we be stay there .<ssssss>
3 4 4 4 4 2 1 3		nice facility , lose point on service overall we enjoy out stay ; the hotel be of good quality , the room be nice and quite spacious , and the facility be well-maintained .<ssssss>however 2 service error leave a bad impression.firstly , we buy a package with late checkout of 4pm .<ssssss>on the day of checkout , we come back to we room before the late checkout time , and have be lock out .<ssssss>we have to explain we case at reception and there be no apology .<ssssss>as we prepare we thing to leave , we could hear the hotel clean staff standing right outside we room door , talk loudly and wait to get in and clean the room .<ssssss>the second we walk out of the room , they all walk straight in - the door do not even close behind us!secondly , we be charge on the bill for a meal we never ordered/ate .<ssssss>i dispute it , and after 5 minute , the woman at reception agree to take it off the bill .<ssssss>a week later i find that this sum have be charge separately to my credit card .<ssssss>when i ring up to query it , i be eventually tell it would be refund , but no apology .<ssssss>i would expect better from such a hotel .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 4 -1		a perfect stay this hotel be perfectly located .<ssssss>you can easily walk to the tiananmen square , the forbid city , a subway station or the famous wangfujin street with all its shop .<ssssss>it be really convenient in such a city lock by endless traffic jams.i stay in the new tower where room be very comfortable and perfectly clean .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be delightful , serve in a quiet garden-type restaurant .<ssssss>i also go to the italian restaurant on the top of the main bulding : beautiful sight over beijing and a good quality restaurant.this hotel be definitely a must in beij at a very reasonnable price .<ssssss>do not hesitate to book there .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 2 3 2 3		very disappointed we choose hotel europe for we 3 night stay in florence base on the positive rating from other review here .<ssssss>however , we be pretty disappoint with the hotel room and they service .<ssssss>first , i think it be a two different world if you get a suite room on the 2nd floor rather than a regular single/double room on the 3rd .<ssssss>apparently , we have a double room .<ssssss>the furnishings be pretty old as well as the carpet that we could see the black stain everywhere .<ssssss>the bathroom be so tiny and not equiped well at all .<ssssss>the shower floor be not raise up to keep the water in the shower .<ssssss>afterall , the most upset experience we encounter be the last day in the morning before we check-out .<ssssss>we tell the staff we need to go out for some last minute shop for about 45 minute and will come back before 11am which be the check-out time .<ssssss>so , we only leave the ac on when leave the room .<ssssss>later we come back about 15 minute before 11 , we find out they come to we room and take the battery out of the tv remote .<ssssss>also they turn off the ac and remove the ac remote from we room too .<ssssss>this behavior be so rude .<ssssss>we feel that we be be very unwelcomed .<ssssss>i understand it be a family run business but they still need to maintain certain professional service .<ssssss>
3 3 3 3 5 2 3 5		ok pro : safe location , clean , funkycon : soulless , uppity front desk staff , do not take the extra step that make a hotel stay special , so-so restaurant.w be located in polanco on hotel row with the intercontinental , marriot and nikko located right next door .<ssssss>there be also a huge hard rock cafe , which make this location somewhat generic .<ssssss>however , i feel perfectly safe walk around at night .<ssssss>there be a close metro station about 2 block away , make it quite convenient.the room be decent size , clean and modern .<ssssss>beside the front desk , the rest of the staff be quite nice and helpful.however , the front desk have problem get my spg -lrb- starwood guest program -rrb- number , and be unable -lrb- do not try -rrb- to get it again until i finally look it up myself online in a matter of a few seconds .<ssssss>i be a spg gold member , and want a upgrade as well as a late checkout -lrb- normal thing i should have get wtih my gold status -rrb- , and they be unable to provide this.solea , the hotel restaurant , have rather mediocre food and unless you be desperate -lrb- and there be many other restaurant nearby within walk distance -rrb- , i would not recommend it .<ssssss>
2 2 2 1 5 4 4 1		be not impress the zenit hotel staff be absolutely lovely and very willing to help but that be about the only good thing i can say about this hotel ... .<ssssss>firstly we arrive in the hotel after much bother -lrb- taxi man could not locate ithe hotel and over charge we -rrb- to find a small but welcome atmosphere .<ssssss>we then receive we key to what can only be describe as the smallest double room i have ever see .<ssssss>we have to walk sidewards around the bed to get to the wardrobe which be ridiculous when the bathroom be almost the same size as the room and the stripy decor on the wall do not help .<ssssss>after request a upgrade , the receptionist move we to the next floor to a double with two single bed , which result in a king size bed free of charge , i suspect because to hotel seem empty .<ssssss>this room be better almost double the size .<ssssss>one we first night we decide to stay local ... big mistake after have a small but good meal in the hotel restaurant we go for a drink .<ssssss>we have two option a loud night club or a strip club -lrb- hotel bar be not open -rrb- .<ssssss>it cost from â‚ ?<ssssss>to â‚ ?<ssssss>0 in a taxi to town which be reasonable .<ssssss>would only recommend this hotel for over night stay .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 3 2 4 1		darling harbour view fantastic .<ssssss>view of hotel from across harbor<ssssss>
3 2 2 4 4 4 3 4		it be a fine place to stay - good value .<ssssss>desk and tv<ssssss>
1 2 1 4 2 4 4 2		the tripadvisor community have fail with this one !!!!<ssssss>location and price do not make a great hotel !<ssssss>this be the number 1 hotel in honolulu ??????!!!!<ssssss>do not be fool by these grossly overinflated tripadvisor rating .<ssssss>this place be actually a fourth rate dumpy hotel with a great location and nice staff .<ssssss>everything be old , run down , shabby , ugly .<ssssss>the room and hallway stink of unidentified odor .<ssssss>the first excuse for a room we stay in be dirty , stain and the a/c unit make so many strange noise that it be hard to sleep .<ssssss>so , we switch room ... the second room -lrb- more expensive -rrb- be still rundown and smell bad .<ssssss>so , we be force to switch again ... the third room be in need of a complete makeover , as be the entire hotel .<ssssss>luckily , the hotel be get a complete overhaul -lrb- and i be sure the price will reflect that -rrb- .<ssssss>have you ever see the show flip this house ?<ssssss>how about flip this hotel !<ssssss>in las vegas this hotel would be immediately implode .<ssssss>
2 4 4 4 5 3 2 -1		enjoy the iberostar hotel white sand beach in punta cana punta cana , dr be okay but i do not fall in love with the island like jamaica .<ssssss>airport be all natural open air with a breeze or fan blow a breeze to check in go thru custom then short wait for bag they tell you which bus you be be transport to you hotel in .<ssssss>it take we 3 try before we actually find the correct bus ... no big deal .<ssssss>the drive be okay , road be pave to hotel from airport but if you go off main road , they be dirt road .<ssssss>airport be pretty landscaped property around it to be beautiful but on the drive to hotel you pass every type of house possible from nice condo , apt , shack big house dirty little town .<ssssss>the road much of dry rocky island have a terrible trash problem with diaper , plastic bottle styrofoam container be in ditch along road or cover big space of land since it appear they have no trash service in countryside .<ssssss>dry desolate island until you reach the hotel zone where there be palm tree hotel after hotel for 20 mile .<ssssss>most of land be develop or in process of be develop so little natural along coast .<ssssss>we hotel iberostar dominicana be great only 2nd to grand bahia principe property which be gorgeous , we stop there on way to we hotel check it out later .<ssssss>iberostar have very nice large room which face the nightly entertainment area which be good bad .<ssssss>good to sit on balcony listen to entertainment but bad when you want to go to sleep before midnight .<ssssss>bathroom be large , hall closet with safe , iron board iron there , tv on small dresser , comfortable bed , couch good size balcony with table chair .<ssssss>we walk for mile up down the pretty white punta cana sand -lrb- not as white as negril -rrb- beach with blue green ocean that be pretty clear but rough surf .<ssssss>ruth ann be not comfortable with big wave after she get knock down by one when she walk into ocean ... she do not swim so i understand .<ssssss>beach be keep pretty clean but some guest be just lazy slob who leave trash on beach rather than walk a few step to trash can .<ssssss>i do not speak much spanish so it be a challenge to speak with many staff or local at small craft market on beach .<ssssss>i miss have lot of vendor to choose from negotiate in espanol be a pain for I the whole calculator game .<ssssss>the vendor do not bug or harass you because the policia keep they all in line .<ssssss>you rarely see a local on beach selling anything but shell guy .<ssssss>they all must wear white shirt with artesan logo on to prove they pay they license fee to govt .<ssssss>no independent work the beach , all govt control .<ssssss>that be a negative to I , i prefer more choice place to beach shop .<ssssss>too many policia on my property all time of day night .<ssssss>i hear they be serious about make sure that dr do not become like ja .<ssssss>police be to make you feel safer , the opposite effect for I as i do not like to vacation in a place that require guard to protect you 24/7 with gun draw ready .<ssssss>iberostar -lrb- as all hotel do -rrb- have dance lesson daily around the pool .<ssssss>i be not into the salsa , merengue or bacchata dance that be so popular there but ra get up take lesson enjoy the music .<ssssss>i be hooked on reggae so it do not do anything for I .<ssssss>i be so sick of hear many foreign language from guest local that i be tickle pink to get home then my brain be speak espanol ... too funny !<ssssss>hear bingo in 5 language every day be annoying but many participate so other enjoy it .<ssssss>entertainment in general encouraged guest to join in game or contest see that everyone be talk to have a good time .<ssssss>i do not love the hotel food although i do not starve but eat hamburger , hot dog , chicken fries for lunch everyday that get old .<ssssss>the variance they have be all seafood base dish neither ra or myself eat fish .<ssssss>chicken be my dish i never tire of it discover iberostar have delicious rotissere chicken at lunch at beach restaurant .<ssssss>breakfast be usually good have fresh fruit , fruit smoothie , excellent pancake , french toast , bacon although not cook crisp usually , egg or omelet cook to order , roll bread to die for .<ssssss>coffee be abundant but we have a hard time get wait staff to bring we water with any meal .<ssssss>it be coffee with milk for breakfast soda or drink for lunch , dinner wine be serve but agua be impossible to get .<ssssss>the oriental specialty restaurant la pagoda have the best wine food of any of the specialty restaurant we try .<ssssss>the steakhouse on beach be disappointment , meat be flavorful but tough .<ssssss>i do not see any reason to get dress up when i be sit in sand for dinner either .<ssssss>la marimbe pork be gross tasting inedible so we leave there go over to buffet for dinner.no difference really between dominicana vs punta cana iberostar although the bavarro section be nicer .<ssssss>they have sign at dinner buttet for international buffet american style cuisine but the food at both restaurant be exactly the same everyday .<ssssss>really not 2 different restaurant but 2 separate by pond that flamingo hang out in .<ssssss>we learn why you should not feed the flamingo , we watch a little boy feed they cook clam they become aggressive bite at other guest as they walk by because they want more food .<ssssss>some guest do not read the sign or just ignore they .<ssssss>food be more european choice always with seafood so it be less than my favorite choices.i may sound pretty negative but i do enjoy myself but not big rush to return there .<ssssss>prefer a english speaking island , more beach vendor , less police , more american , reggae music , less surf , just a more relaxing island like jamaica .<ssssss>i would recommend iberostar for a hotel choice in d.r. as well as grand bahia principe but riu other property along the beach be visibly run down we hear many complaint on the return flight home .<ssssss>i think next trip to d.r. i will try another area , i miss my sunset 6am be too early to get up for pretty sunrise in d.r.<ssssss>

1 3 3 5 4 5 3 -1		avoid this hotel when travel with kid !<ssssss>if you go to singapore with kid , better avoid the mo !<ssssss>the hotel pretend to be child-friendly , so for a 4-days stopover way back from balus to europe we have choose the mo -lrb- instead of the shangri-la valley wing like last year -rrb- : big mistake !<ssssss>as we want to have a drink before dinner in the hotel-lounge : no entry for kid after 5 pm be the strict rule ; club lounge : no kid at all be the strict rule ; hotel lobby : not exist .<ssssss>so there be no place for we for a relax champagne aperitif .<ssssss>have ask the on-duty-manager for the sense of this regulation , the answer be oh yes sir , we be a child-friendly-hotel .<ssssss>due to a prepaid room for my brother wife next door to we we be unable to move to another hotel , so very unlikely we have sto stay here .<ssssss>have a quite and not-runaway-kid and have stay in a lot of luxury city-hotel , this be truly a unique experience : this do not happen in any othe hotel we stay before .<ssssss>so if you have kid with you and like have aperitif , you better avoid this hotel and stay elsewhere !<ssssss>the child-friendly-attribute be just pretend and not true.if you travel alone , the mo be ok , nice but very small -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>room -lrb- we have a harbour suite with beautiful view -rrb- , and excellent breakfast -lrb- in melt cafÃ© -rrb- ; dolce vita italian restaurant be nothing to write about , average food .<ssssss>but we be just glad , that we be allow to go to the restaurant with we kid .<ssssss>nice pool well equipped fitness center .<ssssss>service be excellent and on level of rating .<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 3 -1 4 -1		good location , reasonable price we stay here for 4 night in august , 2005 and be very happy with we stay .<ssssss>we be hoosier folk and after read review for other inexpensive -lrb- by nyc standard , not indiana 's ! -rrb-<ssssss>hotel , i be prepare for a depressing shoebox , but i be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>the room be good size for 2 people , with a large bathroom .<ssssss>the furnishings be clean , modern , and tasteful .<ssssss>the worst thing be we air conditioner , which be loud and with control which be hard to adjust .<ssssss>this be really two building separate by a courtyard .<ssssss>we room be in the back half : so we have to walk outside through the courtyard to get to we room , which might be a problem in rain or snow , but we have no problem with noise .<ssssss>it be a small hotel , so the staff have a personal feel and they be friendly and attentive .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be ordinary but sufficient : good croissant , bagel , orange juice , cereal .<ssssss>there be a internet connect computer in the lobby for guest use to check e-mail or look up review , etc. the best feature be the location so close to the theater district .<ssssss>we go to 3 broadway show in 4 night and they be all within easy walk distance .<ssssss>there be so many restaurant nearby that you get tire of the sidewalk huckster try to get you to stop at they restaurant .<ssssss>there be a comedy club practically across the street , a dry cleaner a half-block away , etc. the subway be not too close , about 6 block .<ssssss>all in all , i would be happy to come back here and look forward to we next visit .<ssssss>
1 2 1 5 1 4 4 -1		good location - no so good hotel problem :1 .<ssssss>i have a prepaid reservation -lrb- make through a official new orlean tourist website -rrb- which state that i be to receive free parking and a confirm upgrade to a deluxe room .<ssssss>the desk clerk state that the upgrade be base on availablilty .<ssssss>the book website and email confirmation have no such disclosure .<ssssss>since i pay such a low fare for the room , i do not want to argue .<ssssss>i smile and take the standard room .2 .<ssssss>the room be of average quality but the bathroom be tiny , dingy , and beat up .<ssssss>there be no counter space and the fixture be rusty and dirty .<ssssss>the bed be small and the threadbare sheet do not cover my 6 ' 2 body .3 .<ssssss>there be wad of kinky hair ball on the carpet in the bedroom and in the hallway .<ssssss>one hairball be on the ceiling above we door .4 .<ssssss>be on the corner of royal and canal put you in one of the noisiest place in the city .<ssssss>even though we be on the 15th floor , we hear all the street noise through the crack window of we room .<ssssss>there be a liqour store directly across the entrance from the hotel and we room 's crack window let in all of the interesting late night/early morning commotion .<ssssss>we do not however , hear any of the other guest .5 .<ssssss>the unsecured parking lot have direct elevator service to guest floor , create a security hazard for the guest .<ssssss>i have one occasion early one morning when a drunk woman -lrb- bottle in hand -rrb- and a pimply face kid be drinking and smoking in the elevator while they ride it up and down look for the pool .<ssssss>although there be guest room card reader and sign that state thay you must have a guest key to enter guest floor , the hotel no longer enforce this .6 .<ssssss>there be three guest elevator and one service elevator .<ssssss>on many occasion , only one elevator be operable .<ssssss>it be very frustrating to have to stop on every floor because service cart and all the other guest have to share one elevator.advantages :1 .<ssssss>location , location , location .<ssssss>be on the corner of royal and canal make it easy to see both the french quarter and location uptown and in the garden district .<ssssss>if you have a car , the location be a plus.summary : unless parking and ease of access to drive be a priority , i would stay away from this hotel .<ssssss>
4 3 4 3 3 4 5 2		very nice hotel with a touch of snootiness .<ssssss>i stay here for a few day during the first week of may -lrb- i also stay at the hilton eiffel tower as well if you want a comparison -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel be very nice and the staff be exceptional .<ssssss>i be hope for a room upgrade , be a gold member , but there be no upgrade to be have for all 5 day i be there .<ssssss>they do compensate I with free breakfast coupon for they breakfast buffet .<ssssss>that turn out to be quite a deal as they charge 30 euro for breakfast !<ssssss>i do not know who pay that kind of money for breakfast , but it be always pack .<ssssss>the room be small , as expect in europe , but very neat and mostly clean .<ssssss>there be some normal wear and tear , but in the bathroom there be a good bit of mold in the shower and ceiling .<ssssss>otherwise , the bathroom be nice with a seperate tub and shower .<ssssss>the only other complaint i have be the airconditioning be turn off .<ssssss>i still find it hard to believe that a hotel like this would still decide when they customer would like airconditioning .<ssssss>it be still a bit cool in may , but be in a small room with stagnant air can become very uncomfortable and warm .<ssssss>open a window be just ok , but the noise level outside make it impractical for I .<ssssss>the hotel be very popular with business people and upscale traveler , so i do not exactly fit in around there .<ssssss>the patron seem to have a bit of snob appeal but the staff be very pleasant .<ssssss>the location be a bit out of the way except for the arc de triomphe .<ssssss>make use of the excellent subway system in paris be recommend and effortless , otherwise you will be spend a good bit of money to get to the rest of paris from this location.i would stay here again if the price be right , otherwise you will find I at hilton 's eiffel tower location .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 3 3 5 -1		nice resort with a few kink to work out .<ssssss>we villa<ssssss>
2 1 4 2 2 2 1 2		do not compare to the riu resort let I preface this by say ... this be not my first time to a all inclusive resort in the dominican or other country .<ssssss>so , i have experience and know what one should expect .20 december - 27 december 2007 - book thru funjet .<ssssss>weather be terrific with lot of sun and temp in the 80s -lrb- f -rrb- with heat index near 90 -lrb- f -rrb- , only a couple of shower ... so the weather be just about perfect .<ssssss>the resort be huge and the room be very , very nice -lrb- all jr suite -rrb- .<ssssss>sadly , i have say everything nice i can really say about gran bahia .<ssssss>i find out very quickly that uno momento , 1 minute , or 5 minute basically mean i can not help you , will not help you , and will not be back .<ssssss>first day , check into the room with 2 adult and 1 almost teenager have be up from 2:30 be to make a flight until arrive in punta cana around 4pm in the afternoon .<ssssss>total of 2 towel in the room , no hand towel , no face towel .<ssssss>call the front desk , call guest service and report .<ssssss>5 minute sir be the reply .<ssssss>it take until noon the next day -lrb- 4 phone call , trip to the front desk and trip to guest service -rrb- .<ssssss>would be fine if this be the only time we could not get towel but it be just the first time .<ssssss>there be several other .<ssssss>there be a mini-bar -lrb- actually just a in-room mini-fridge -rrb- that be suppose to be restock daily .<ssssss>do not hold you breath .<ssssss>it will not be stock daily .<ssssss>they tell you in the info in the room , and everywhere else for that matter , to not drink the tap water .<ssssss>nice ... but how about restock the bottle water daily ... that would be a really nice touch .<ssssss>i find that the only way i could keep water and soda in the room be to walk around the complex look for a housekeeping cart that have those item visible on the cart and take they .<ssssss>otherwise , i be continually tell , uno momento and then later ... sorry , could not find any .<ssssss>what ?<ssssss>be you kid I ?<ssssss>complain to guest service ... whose famous phrase be not a problem , we will take care of it !<ssssss>no , it be a big problem .<ssssss>other have mention that this be not a 24 hour resort .<ssssss>this be also very disappointing .<ssssss>we have be to other resort where you can get food that be include in you package up until the wee hour of the am .<ssssss>not here .<ssssss>a big difference we find between this resort and what we have experience elsewhere -lrb- mostly riu resort -rrb- be that the people who work at the resort be just not friendly .<ssssss>at other resort , it be almost like everyone be there to entertain you and be very friendly .<ssssss>even when you pass someone who be clipping tree , bush , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>they would acknowledge the fact you be there .<ssssss>here ... very few people have a smile on they face .<ssssss>tip - i understand it be they way these folk make they money .<ssssss>bartender ... they do not get it .<ssssss>they could probably make twice what they do in tip if they would just loosen up and be a bit more entertaining .<ssssss>they just pour you a drink and look at you with the look of where be my tip ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>if you drink rum - it be include in you all inclusive .<ssssss>if you want something besides rum ... be ready to pay for it .<ssssss>what a joke .<ssssss>oh and there be no liquor dispenser in the room .<ssssss>if you want a drink late at night .<ssssss>.<ssssss>you get ta get up and go out to get it.the food be substandard even for buffet food .<ssssss>the bacon be almost raw .<ssssss>if you just want scramble egg ... they be undercooked .<ssssss>the food have almost no variation from night to night -lrb- something we have find different at other resort -rrb- .<ssssss>about the only variation be the dessert .<ssssss>if something be suppose to be sweet ... it be over sweet .<ssssss>oh and if you want coffee with dessert ... too bad ... can not get it .<ssssss>as a matter of fact ... try finding coffee anywhere other than at breakfast .<ssssss>pretty much do not exist .<ssssss>but , you have a coffee maker in you room ... right ?<ssssss>yep , just can not get they to leave you bottle water to make coffee with.you could get burger and hotdog out by the pool near the beach and there be a soda dispenser there also .<ssssss>be not work the day we get there ... still be not the day we leave .<ssssss>the burger be cook unmercifully hard and the hot dog be barely warm , much less cook .<ssssss>again , have do all inclusive during the holiday for a number of year now .<ssssss>this be by far the worst experience we have have .<ssssss>like i say ... beautiful resort and great weather .<ssssss>too bad the little thing that should make the holiday pleasant be just miss .<ssssss>in a nutshell ... there be a beautiful riu resort right next door to the gran bahia ... you might want to consider stay there .<ssssss>the people be friendly and they really do appreciate the fact you be stay at they resort .<ssssss>sorry for the long post but want to state the fact as we find they .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 4 1 2 -1		do not recommend i be totally puzzle as to how this hotel be # 2 in ta .<ssssss>we pay â‚ ?<ssssss>20 a night for a twin room .<ssssss>we room be terrible - very small and uncomfortable , there be no way these room be 4 star .<ssssss>when we ask for a better room we be inform all the twin room be the same .<ssssss>it do not matter how much cheap cava be provide in reception , or how much free beer and coke you can drink from the mini-bar , if the room be bad , the hotel be bad .<ssssss>â‚ ?<ssssss>20 be massively overprice for what we get .<ssssss>if you can get a twin inc. breakfast for less than â‚ ?<ssssss>00 , go for it , otherwise , there have to be better place than this in madrid .<ssssss>on the plus side , the breakfast be good and the location be good .<ssssss>there be no hotel security during the day , and the staff do not seem to care who walk around the hotel - we be hold at reception for 20 minute as they could not find we booking , and in that time 2 different dodgy-looking people who clearly be not guest come in , hang around and eye we handbag and luggage until they realise i be watch they , and then they leave .<ssssss>the reception staff do not seem to notice or care , which be very odd<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 3 3 5		would stay again for nyc , this place be great .<ssssss>spacious room , good location , very smartly renovate recently , good service from housekeeping , reception/concierge adequate.would stay again .<ssssss>
2 3 2 4 5 4 5 4		a question of luck this be the third time i have stay at the chesterfield .<ssssss>my first room be very noisy , as it give onto charle street - just about every taxi in london must go past the hotel .<ssssss>at the time , i tell the hotel that less would be more : the small room be so overcrowded with little pillow , vase and other unnecessary item that you can hardly move round .<ssssss>the second time i be lucky as i have a room at the back , but it be equally cluster .<ssssss>this time be the worst , though i be tell i have be upgrade to a junior suite .<ssssss>the floorboard creak so much in my room and in those next and above it that i do not dare go to the - tiny - bathroom during the night !<ssssss>short of lie on the bed , it be very uncomfortable to watch the - not flat-screen - tv .<ssssss>the drawer be too small to put a shirt into they .<ssssss>the room be be heat through the air-conditioning - very noisy and it blow the smoke from the smoking room into what should be a non-smoking room .<ssssss>so , do beware of the room which have a name plate on the door!now a more positive note : as other reviewer have point out , staff be very friendly and i love the restaurant , especially in the evening , though breakfast be also very good -lrb- too expensive -rrb- .<ssssss>i shall return to the chesterfield , but only to eat , not to stay .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		pro 's and con 's , and too expensive .<ssssss>i spend a weekend in february with my girlfriend in the amsterdam marriott .<ssssss>the location be great , close to leidseplein area with its restaurant , bar , cinema and theater and also close to the museum .<ssssss>the staff be very nice and helpful , check in take quite a while though .<ssssss>the room -lrb- whe have a executive -rrb- be large , but the heating be not good enough to get the room to a acceptable temperature -lrb- change the room do not help -rrb- and we be really cold throughout we stay .<ssssss>the a/c be very loud .<ssssss>tiny bathroom which definitely need a overhaul as it show trace of many year of usage .<ssssss>so the room be not up to marriott standard , however the price be .<ssssss>would not go there again ; i usually prefer marriott over intercontis , but in amsterdam it be definitely vice versa .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 4 3 4 2		overprice just stay at the hotel march 14-15 .<ssssss>the bed be extremely comfortable and provide a great night 's sleep .<ssssss>the location be also a huge plus ... close to the cable car and right next to bus/street car stop and lot of dine nearby .<ssssss>however , the hotel definately do not have the ` luxury ' feel , though you may pay a luxury price for it .<ssssss>the room be small and the bathroom be tiny .<ssssss>we have a view of market street which be great , though they originally try stick we in on the interior of the building , face the roof , so we call the front desk to get into the other room .<ssssss>and keep in mind , if you reserve online , do not expect they to uphold any special request you may make .<ssssss>we request a room on the highest floor possible , yet we be give a room on the 5th floor -lrb- the lowest floor in the hotel . -rrb-<ssssss>we second room be on the 6th floor and give to we 10 min after check-in , so they obviously have room available on higher level .<ssssss>all the staff be very friendly and usually helpful .<ssssss>the ` business center ' have computer with internet connection , though know in advance that the internet there cost extra , which should not be the case for the price you pay for a night 's stay .<ssssss>the parking be $ 42 a day with valet , which be comparable to other hotel in the area .<ssssss>all in all it be a ` nice ' hotel , but the price do not reflect what you get in return .<ssssss>
3 3 3 3 4 1 2 -1		disappointing we stop in singapore for one night en route to australia .<ssssss>the orchard hotel be well located , and the room be comfortable enough .<ssssss>however , we arrive at 8:30 pm and the room be not ready until 9:30 .<ssssss>room service be slow , even after reach they -lrb- the direct phone line do not work -rrb- .<ssssss>
2 1 1 3 2 3 3 1		do not go there if you have a car we arrive quite late in the evening by car , and it be difficult even to stop by the hotel to ask about the parking .<ssssss>we end up parking around the block -lrb- probably illegally -rrb- , and be advise that the hotel guest can use a parking lot a few block away .<ssssss>the area be full of homeless , and when we find the parking lot it be empty and we do not feel secure leave the car there by itself .<ssssss>however , we do not have much other choice as there be no supervised parking in the area .<ssssss>when we book the hotel through venere , the information be that the hotel have a garage .<ssssss>this be not true .<ssssss>unload the luggage be also quite difficult as there be nowhere to stop outside the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel have carpet both in the hallway and in the room , and these seem so old that they really do not feel clean .<ssssss>so even if the room probably be clean it feel quite dusty .<ssssss>there be no ventilation and as other have mention it be impossible to open the window ... well you can , but they be old and quite dangerous .<ssssss>the bathroom be large , but the appliance -lrb- hairdryer -rrb- do not really look usable .<ssssss>the location be ok ; it be central , but full of homeless .<ssssss>they be not dangerous , but i would not rate this as the best neighborhood .<ssssss>go around from the hotel be easy because of the tram and bus stop just outside the hotel entrance .<ssssss>
4 5 5 -1 4 -1 3 -1		a great find in the heart of the real florence .<ssssss>i stay at the hotel una vittoria with some friend from 5th to 7th august 2005 .<ssssss>we have a great stay .<ssssss>the decor be modern , clean and refreshing .<ssssss>the breakfast be excellent and the hotel staff speak good english and be keen to help -lrb- refresh for italy -rrb- !<ssssss>we have a superior room which have a very comfortable bed , mini-bar , deep bath and shower in a wet room , plasma screen tv -lrb- english speaking channel be ccn , bbc world and mtv -rrb- and air conditioning .<ssssss>all this for Â£87 per room per night be excellent value .<ssssss>a couple of thing to note about the room though , the wet room seem to collect puddle so you end up wade through the water after a shower until the maid have be .<ssssss>also , there seem to be no extractor fan and everyone who stay have to call someone to sort out the safe .<ssssss>we ask for room service one day and seem to through they into a bit of confusion but they do bring we up a couple of sandwich which be fine.the area itself be about 20min walk from the ponte vecchio and probably 25min from the duomo .<ssssss>i find it refreshing to have a distance between I and the heave crowd near the centre .<ssssss>also there be a few excellent local bar and restaurant around the hotel which be much more fun to explore than the more traditional hangout .<ssssss>fantastic people watch potential.in summary , i thoroughly enjoy my stay at the una hotel vittoria .<ssssss>the modern decor and the local surroundings make for a different view of florence that you may not get at a expensive hotel in the touristy centre .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 1 2 4 -1		not for we so to counter this review , let I say that a lot of people at the resort really seem to enjoy they holiday .<ssssss>we be there for a wedding and we have a great group of people to spend time with , so that part of we trip be fab .<ssssss>but most people in we group have many of the minor problem we did.added up , it make for not a great resort - not for we anyway.the good : mamajuana -lrb- make sure its well ` soak ' -rrb- the lobby be beautiful .<ssssss>alexandre at the lobby bar love he job!loved the look of ` restuarant row ` mike 's really be that goodthe sand be soft , water be warm !!<ssssss>the vendor be handy for trinket shopping.bartenders be among the friendliest we have encountered.we have picture take in the water , with the animal , etc with the pro photgrapher on staff.route 66 be good , as be pizza and burger and the breakfast selection -lrb- although not what we go on vacation to eat -rrb- the bad : after check we in , the front desk be very unhelpful .<ssssss>we have request a king bed and a upper floor .<ssssss>when we receive neither we ask to switch room .<ssssss>after 4 different people tell we different story and keep tell we to come back later , we give up after a day , unpacked and settle in.the room -lrb- 9121 -rrb- be equivalent to a motel 6 .<ssssss>poor lighting -lrb- yes we know from the review it would be bad , but ... -rrb- , dirty bathroom -lrb- broken tile , mold -rrb- , a smell way beyond its the tropics musty in the room , and when the air conditioning finally kick in , it could not be turn off .<ssssss>it be just not equal to other ' 4?1/2 ' star resort we have be to in mexico and cuba .<ssssss>not as nice as the 3 star hotel we stay in in mexico.we find a ` straight razor ' blade sit we bed one afternoon , after the room have be clean - definately not ours.most people in we group be lock out of they room at least once - it be not a issue with the key , as the maid could not get in either .<ssssss>instead the technician have to be call to fix the lock .<ssssss>the mini bar include beer only on the first day.dinners be not tasty , nor relaxing .<ssssss>i have never be in a louder series of restaurant -lrb- more of a issue with out of control kid - or they parent - than the resort -rrb- we have dinner at la bodega -lrb- $ 200 for 4 people , include 2 bottle -rrb- and while the environment be quiet and the wine be good , the dinner be nothing special.the pool be big , but they be dirty and very moldy .<ssssss>do not see anyone clean they all week .<ssssss>all in all , we have fun : go horseback ride , golfing and deep sea fishing ; drink lot of rum , splash around in the ocean and have lot of siesta .<ssssss>we will not go back to ocean sand/blue , and will continue to seek out adults-only all-inclusive .<ssssss>we would rank this resort 3?1/2 star , definately not 4?1/2 ...<ssssss>
3 4 3 5 3 5 -1 4		good price , good place .<ssssss>pool area<ssssss>
4 4 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		location , kocation , location i stay at the metro 11 year ago , the location be second to none , slap bang in the thick of it , macy 's to the right , 5th avenue to the left , perfect and this be the decide factor for a return trip to the metro .<ssssss>i be disappoint with the decoration of the hotel ; it be shall we say tired and clearly have not have a touch up since my last trip .<ssssss>have say that , the room be spotless , and clean every day .<ssssss>we be on the 12th floor with a great view of the empire state .<ssssss>we have 2 double bed in we room ; the bathroom be big with red hot water , a big cupboard for we clothes and case and a safe .<ssssss>the fridge come in handy but it be very noisy in the night .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t have breakfast in the hotel instead we go out , we find a great place call jimmyâ€™s on 6th avenue serve a huge variety of hot food , which set we up for the day .<ssssss>the metro promote brendonâ€™s bar which be opposite the hotel ; i would not recommend this place at all , and i suggest the metro remove they association .<ssssss>the staff and service be appalling , we be make to feel grateful for get a drink .<ssssss>after sit we down at a table , it be apparent that the diner around we be not satisfied , so we decide to pay for we drink and leave .<ssssss>we have a great meal in the metro grill next to the hotel instead .<ssssss>i would definitely stay at the metro again but would hope theyâ€™ve have a bit of a refurb by then !<ssssss>
4 4 2 5 4 4 3 4		great value but some poky room the deal they offer I -- eur55 a night for a single en suite room include breakfast and tax -- be excellent value give the location -- it be at the northern end of la rambla , literally a few door down from plaÃ§a de catalunya with its local train and metro station and its bus stop for the airport , sightseeing and several local bus .<ssssss>the location also place the hotel within easy walk distance of both the historic heart of the old city and the later eixample with its celebrated moderniste architecture .<ssssss>the first floor room be small and basic but clean and comfortable -- the catch be that there be no natural light , with only a small window look out onto a gloomy ventilation well .<ssssss>fine if you be out all the time and only need a base to dump luggage , shower and sleep but not a place to hang out during the day .<ssssss>breakfast be standard self service cereal , bread , jam and simple pastry , though with fresh fruit and yoghurt too .<ssssss>the multilingual staff on the 24-hour reception be friendly and helpful , but , as i find when i meet up with a friend base in barcelona , they take a dim view of visitor in the room .<ssssss>

4 2 5 4 4 4 3 4		hipster intercontinental we stay at the boston intercontinental on a monday night in july .<ssssss>we have stay at the ic in atlanta and i like the ic property .<ssssss>the ic in boston be just gorgeous !<ssssss>gleam modern dÃ©cor , two incredibly hip hotel bar -lrb- rumba and sushi tec -rrb- and room that be really gorgeous .<ssssss>if you want young , hip , and modern this be you place .<ssssss>i enjoy the bar scene there so much i end up go back with a friend the next night even though we have move to a different hotel for a business conference .<ssssss>the room be spacious and have some very nice amenity such as small reading light on the bed and a door that slide open to the tub .<ssssss>we pay extra for the club level .<ssssss>note if you stay at any ic property they always offer you a upgrade club level at check in for just a bit more money .<ssssss>sometimes , as in we case , the front desk folk forget to offer the upgrade .<ssssss>we remind they as we check in and get the upgrade for only $ 50 more .<ssssss>i feel the club level be worth a bit extra as it entitle you to drink , hot appetizer at night , bottled water , juice etc and a fairly large breakfast .<ssssss>in fact , at both the icâ€™s we have stay in the breakfast buffet include in the club lounge be exactly the same as the one in they main restaurant.i do have some minor gripe about the boston ic .<ssssss>when we arrive no doorman be there to help we with we baggage .<ssssss>we find that the service across the board be friendly but young , slow and inexperienced .<ssssss>for example , i order a expensive bottle of champagne while i sit in the outdoor patio area which be clearly set up as part of they bar .<ssssss>the waiter be very nice but young .<ssssss>he didnâ€™t know the price when i ask , he take at least 40 minute to bring out my champagne and complain that he be the only waiter work this large area .<ssssss>the concierge in the evening at the club level couldnâ€™t even recommend a good italian restaurant when askedâ€ ello ?<ssssss>what exactly do a concierge at the club level do if they canâ€™t even answer a basic question like that ?!?<ssssss>if you be try for a world class hotel that cater to top executive and business traveler , they be go to expect veteran service by well inform and train staff .<ssssss>the boston ic be really lagging in that department .<ssssss>we do not get nightly turn down service as we normally do in the atlanta property , we room have some minor issue -lrb- light burn out , phone not work -rrb- that further make I feel service be not what it need to be .<ssssss>if the ic boston get they service up to par they will have a really great hotel on they handsâ€ f you be someone who like a lively lobby bar screw the service issue this place be a blast !<ssssss>

3 3 3 2 5 3 5 -1		good and not so good we have a 4 night break over the weekend after easter .<ssssss>pay Â£360 on web which i guess be pretty fair for this time of year in what can be a very expensive city anyway -lrb- florence be pretty well gear up to extract money from tourist ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>hotel be quite a way out of town - if you include the time to negotiate the nearby ring road in one piece you be probably the best part of half a hour stroll .<ssssss>the route be direct though and you can not get lost.nothing much of interest around the hotel , a couple of restaurant nearby -lrb- will cost about euro 60-70 for two for 2 course and house wine and this seem to be the norm in florence -rrb- .<ssssss>good deli just up the road on the plazza della liberta with nice people and great cheese , olive , etc.by the way , beware restaurant in florence with bottle of wine pre-set on the table - the impression be that this be the normal house wine but it be more likely you will be charge euro 25 or so for something that taste no better .<ssssss>we have a bad experience of this and awful expensive food at ristorante da mimmo on the via san gallo which run from near the hotel to the town centre .<ssssss>not a nice experience.anyway , back to the hotel .<ssssss>i travel extensively for business and i would rate this hotel as a good 3 star , not a 4 star .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and pleasant , we room be pristine in term of cleanliness -lrb- which be the most important thing for I -rrb- and the breakfast be quite adequate -lrb- you might not be entirely happy if you like english style hot breakfast though i suppose -rrb- .<ssssss>room be big enough although no bath or facility to make a hot drink in the room which be a nuisance.the big downside with we room be the noise .<ssssss>we be at the front of the hotel and it be like a race track out there at certain time of the day .<ssssss>this sadly mean we could not open the window as the noise would have be intolerable and we could not get the air-con to work but this be ' t a issue for we as the weather be mild.we be expect a double bed but in fact we get two twin bed push together .<ssssss>not the end of the world though .<ssssss>get a pleasant surprise with the room safe - we be not charge anything for use it which be most unusual in my experience .<ssssss>all in all , would be happy to return to this hotel but i think we would make sure we get a room away from the front .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 3 4		great location and furnishings but ... i stay here in august and although the hotel inside be beautiful and the location for site see be excellent , i do not think i would stay here again.i think the first impression put I off , we arrive at reception about a hour before check in time and we politely ask if we could get in we room early and we be meet by a stand offish response form the receptionist who say no room be available .<ssssss>fair enough , we be early but it be the tone of she voice .<ssssss>she suggest we go out and come back later but as we have be on a early flight we just want to get shower and change so we say we would sit in the lounge area and get a drink instead .<ssssss>it then take 2 hour for a room to become available .<ssssss>we have book a club level superior room which include wifus so we ask how we access the internet and she say it would be charge to the room , we have to argue and get out we confirmation email before who would accept that it be free of charge , then she say it would be bill and when we come to check out we would have to remind they to remove any charge !<ssssss>this be standard with this rate so why be this such and issue ?<ssssss>throughout the stay the reception staff always react like it be a inconvenience when ask they any question .<ssssss>the safe be lock on enter the room and it take they 2 hour to send someone up to sort it out.but aside from be make unwelcome the actual hotel be furnish to a high standard with the most amazing comfortable bed and modern furnishings .<ssssss>the continental breakfast in the cub lounge be not great but there be enough to start you on you day and the lady who be serve we in there be particularly lovely to us.the location be fantastic for sight see .<ssssss>we manage 4 day in new york with only get the subway once as we be able to walk everywhere .<ssssss>it be also very convenient for the broadway show -lrb- we see the little mermaid and it be fantastic -rrb- .<ssssss>when look for a hotel in ny we do a lot of research and we pick this hotel for location and also because we have never be before we be worry about safety in nyc so want to stay on a main busy road .<ssssss>have be there now and see how safe it actually be i would happily go for one of the hotel locate in the lesser known site street where you get more value for money , but you can not take away the convenience of this location .<ssssss>

4 2 4 5 4 5 5 4		great location ; not much atmosphere i be rating this hotel four star mostly because it be nicer than those to which i usually give three , but i do so somewhat begrudgingly .<ssssss>actually there be quite a bit not to like.let 's start with the positive : superb location at union square , so close to absolutely everything and easy to get everywhere you want to go .<ssssss>great shopping and sightseeing nearby .<ssssss>the room be large and reasonably well furnished .<ssssss>i have a corner room , which the front desk say be larger than some of the other room , so you might try request one of those as a special request or a upgrade if you be so inclined .<ssssss>front desk and staff be helpful and friendly .<ssssss>the restaurant and bar at the top have a great view , but i do not try the food so can not comment on that .<ssssss>negative -lrb- or not-so-positive -rrb- : it be a typical , run-of-the-mill , large , urban hyatt convention hotel .<ssssss>there be no style or charm to speak of .<ssssss>it be very pricey , and you be not get luxury accomodation .<ssssss>while the funishing be fine , a couple of the lamp in my room be ding up and cheap look -- surprising for a room in this price range .<ssssss>because it have so many room , at peak time the elevator run really slow .<ssssss>i be surprise at how much sound i could hear through the door and wall .<ssssss>fortunately , there be no partier .<ssssss>basically , you be stay here because you company have a contract with hyatt , you be build up you hyatt point , you convention be here , or you be from out of town and you recognize the hyatt name and figure it be a safer choice than all those other san francisco hotel you have never hear of .<ssssss>if you will look around , you likely will find other hotel with as good a location for the same or less money that will be much more interesting .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 5 5 -1 3		very nice hotel spend three night at the ambassador .<ssssss>it be in a prime locaton for shopping .<ssssss>it be a older hotel , so do not expect a fancy 21st century property .<ssssss>you get a clean nice room , good tv , nice bath .<ssssss>the hotel have double door lead into the room , so you get less noise from the hallway , say that however , i hear no noise from the hallway at anytime .<ssssss>the lobby be very nice , and the staff helpful and friendly .<ssssss>the buffet breakfast in the morning be fantastic , one of the best i have see .<ssssss>large breakfast room look out on the pass street scene .<ssssss>if i go back to berlin i would certainly stay here again .<ssssss>

4 4 4 5 5 3 5 3		a wonderful family vacation we stay at the punta cana resort club for 7 night from jan. 29 to feb. 5 , 2007 .<ssssss>we choose this resort because it seem to suit all we requirement : a beautiful location , good food , a quiet , dignified atmosphere , and family-friendly accomodations.we stay in a 2-bedroom nature casita , which be absolutely perfect for we .<ssssss>there be 4 of we , span 3 generation .<ssssss>so my husband and i have the queen-bed bedroom to ourselves -lrb- include we own bathroom -rrb- , while we 3-year-old and she grandma happily share the other bedroom , which have two separate bed -lrb- and its own bathroom -rrb- .<ssssss>the bedroom be not luxurious , but they be clean and comfortable enough .<ssssss>my only complaint would be the pillow , which be a bit too firm for my taste , and the air-conditioning unit , which i find a bit noisy .<ssssss>but those thing can vary from one room to another ; my daughter and mother have no such problem .<ssssss>all in all , we get what we expect for the price , and i would say it be very good value.each casita come with a open-air living room , which be important for we because we all have different bedtime - my daughter much earlier , grandma much later .<ssssss>so the livingroom be a good place to hang out for whomever be not in bed yet .<ssssss>there be some mosquito , but by keep the two ceiling fan turn on at full speed and use some insect repellent , we be not really bother .<ssssss>we little gecko friend help out too .<ssssss>; - -rrb- we be very careful never to get any tap water into we mouth , not even while brushing we tooth , and i be happy to report that none of we have any gastro-intestinal problem .<ssssss>we leave a generous tip for the room-cleaning staff every day , along with a note -lrb- in spanish -rrb- request extra bottled water , and this work very well : we always have a generous supply of bottled water , enough to take along to the beach , etc.btw , here be a tip , especially if you be stay in a nature casita : there be a lovely little swimming pool amidst the nature casita that nobody seem to know about , probably because it be not indicate on any of the map of the resort .<ssssss>-lrb- i guess it be a new pool and it just have not make it onto the map yet . -rrb-<ssssss>it be near the south-west corner or the tennis court , but sheltered by lot of vegetation .<ssssss>there be sign that lead to it if you be in the area of the nature casita ; that be how we happen to find it .<ssssss>it be a wonderfully quiet place to have a early morning dip before breakfast or a cool swim in the middle of the day .<ssssss>it be get a built-in waterfall/grotto feature at one end and a extra-shallow section for small child at the other end .<ssssss>some lounger chair too .<ssssss>and because of all the tree around , it get a lot of shade -lrb- unlike the main pool and adjacent wade pool , which get practically no shade at all -rrb- .<ssssss>we end up go to this wonderful little pool at least once a day and we usually have it all to ourselves .<ssssss>: - -rrb- we casita be a very pleasant , leisurely 10-minute walk from the beach .<ssssss>no shuttle require , although we could have use one if we have want to .<ssssss>some people rent golf cart to get around the resort , but we really do not find this necessary.as for the beach , it be absolutely gorgeous and it never feel crowd , with plenty of lounger chair and even some hammock .<ssssss>beach towel too .<ssssss>however if , like we , you require some protective shade to enjoy a day at the beach , you need to get there early to make sure you get one of the palapa .<ssssss>but fail that , you can usually still find a cluster of palm trees.as for the water , it be the perfect temperature and calm enough for smaller child to enjoy .<ssssss>-lrb- yes , there be a bit of seaweed but the staff do a good job of keep it under control and we be not bother by it . -rrb-<ssssss>my husband be a serious swimmer and he be able to go for very long swim every day along the whole length of the beach .<ssssss>other water sport we enjoy be kayaking and windsurfing .<ssssss>the beach activity staff be always very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>we do not go snorkel , though .<ssssss>the water near the beach be not really clear enough to snorkel and we never get up the momentum to go on a snorkel trip .<ssssss>however , we do take a guide tour along the nature trail to one of the more out-of-the-way cenote that be particularly beautiful , great for swimming -lrb- though not with small child ! -rrb-<ssssss>and crystal clear .<ssssss>if we ever go back , that be where i will be take my snorkel gear.finally , the food .<ssssss>my husband i be very much into good food and , though we be not food snob , we tend to travel on we stomach .<ssssss>the food at the la cana be , in we opinion , really quite good for a buffet restaurant .<ssssss>both at breakfast and at supper , there be always a wide variety to choose from -lrb- include some local speciality , which we appreciate very much -rrb- and , as far as we could tell , the food be always freshly prepare .<ssssss>all in all , we be quite impressed with the buffet offering - which be a relief because you do not really want to take a 3-year-old to a Ã  la carte restaurant more often than you have to .<ssssss>that say , we really enjoy la choza restaurant for lunch : it be right on the beach -lrb- very convenient -rrb- and the food there be quite good , especially the seafood .<ssssss>and for three or more people , la choza 's local version of paella be worth a try .<ssssss>another lunch option be the pizzeria by the main pool .<ssssss>you best bet there , in we opinion , be the pizza .<ssssss>the other stuff we have there be rather forgettable .<ssssss>we have dinner at the italian restaurant one evening and that be a nice change - mostly for the ambiance .<ssssss>the food there be quite good .<ssssss>but again , with a 3-year-old in tow , it be not so good that be not equally happy to go to the buffet at la cana every other evening.the staff at this resort be generally very friendly and helpful , especially at the lower echelon .<ssssss>base on previous review , i be brace for a lengthy check-in process upon arrival -lrb- at 10 p.m. , no less -rrb- but it be fine .<ssssss>ok , the front desk staff seem a bit less than eager , but they be always polite .<ssssss>and beyond the front desk , the staff be always extremely friendly .<ssssss>it really do help if you try to speak a bit of spanish .<ssssss>they genuinely appreciate the effort.if you have child , definitely visit the petting farm and the adjacent ranch .<ssssss>a shuttle will be happy to take you there and pick you up again .<ssssss>my 3-year-old get to ride on a pony for the first time ever and that be the highlight of the week for she .<ssssss>: - -rrb- the kid club seem well run , though there be only two small child use it during the week we be at the resort , so it be hard to tell .<ssssss>and i have no other kid club experience to compare it to .<ssssss>but the young woman in charge seem very nice when i chat with she .<ssssss>-lrb- i take my daughter to play in the playground there , but she be still too young for the actual kid ' club .<ssssss>maybe next year .<ssssss>: - -rrb- the fact that this resort be not all inclusive be a bit of a inconvenience at time .<ssssss>daily additional expense include lunch , all beverage -lrb- except at breakfast -rrb- and most of the Ã  la carte restaurant at dinner .<ssssss>fortunately , you do not have to carry cash around , or even you credit card , since it all go on you tab via you room key/card , which you use like a credit card .<ssssss>but these separate expense do add up .<ssssss>then again , you do not get the heavy-drinking party type at this resort that you might elsewhere .<ssssss>what you do get be a nice mix of family with -lrb- usually younger -rrb- child , retiree -lrb- many of whom come for the golf -rrb- , and couple who be look for a nice quiet beach vacation .<ssssss>and they come from a interesting variety of place , too : france , germany , the uk , spain , italy , the we and canada , among other .<ssssss>we really enjoy the wide mix of nationalities.to sum up , we thoroughly enjoy we one-week stay at this resort .<ssssss>for we purpose , it be exactly the right choice : quiet location , beautiful beach , child-friendly environment , good food , two-bedroom + livingroom accomodation .<ssssss>it be not all perfect , but it be very good value for the price .<ssssss>we would go back again , and maybe next time we will spring for one of the beach casitas - a bit pricier but more conveniently located .<ssssss>
1 1 -1 2 -1 3 4 -1		do not desserve the price ... i be fond of the different hotel of the chain : mario , laura ... but here the price be far too high compare to the poor quality of the rooms.i have a junior suite -lrb- 250 eur -rrb- which be : - floor look dirty - window be not close and could not be - water have still he bar code -lrb- not the price hopefully -rrb- - decoration be not even nice - the bed be not stable - toilet small - no hair dryer - shower , not bath !<ssssss>should have both option .<ssssss>- breakfast = american coffee -lrb- can not be consider as real coffee , believe I -rrb- .<ssssss>i ask for expresso and i be say there be none !!!<ssssss>unbelievable !!!<ssssss>- no computer available in the lobby - i be offer to go behind the desk ... of course the swimming pool be not open : not inform when i booked.bar on the roof top : same thing , not open , not informed.you can send mail to confirm the reservation and ask for feedback but first of all you need to justify the ridiculously price !!!<ssssss>last one : 25 minute to have a taxi ... to finish with something positive : the personal , nice and welcome .<ssssss>what can i say : extremely disappointing .<ssssss>go to the mario or laura , it be better .<ssssss>
4 2 5 -1 5 -1 5 -1		so attentive !<ssssss>what a wonderful place !<ssssss>the room and bathroom be perfect , and the staff be so attentive and polite .<ssssss>we could not have ask for better ... except the food and drink be vastly overprice .<ssssss>we pay nearly Â£80 for both of we for lunch , and only have a few piece of sushi .<ssssss>and a non-alcoholic cocktail be Â£8 .<ssssss>we soon find other place to eat !<ssssss>
3 3 3 -1 4 -1 1 -1		big room , ambivalent service , poor plasma tv two-night stay in early december 2005 .<ssssss>service level , unfortunately , depend greatly on the individual employee you encounter .<ssssss>i be check into a standard room with a non-working tv and two double bed -lrb- i be 6-4 . -rrb-<ssssss>when i return to the desk at 11:35 pm , with all my luggage in tow , i say , we will have to try again - the tv will not turn on with either the remote or the button on the tv .<ssssss>without look up or give I any eye contact , the clerk say we will have engineering go up in a bit .<ssssss>this be at 11:35 pm .<ssssss>not the answer i expect or be look for ; certainly no apology or empathy .<ssssss>so , i escalate with well , give that i be 6-4 , i would prefer a king bed anyway , so let 's go ahead and try another room .<ssssss>the clerk 's response : we do not have any king room leave .<ssssss>say in a flat tone of voice , still without eye contact .<ssssss>lucky for I , the clerk who have originally check I in -lrb- with good hospitality -rrb- come out at that moment and recover nicely for the other clerk , immediately place I in what pp call a junior suite but what be actually a larger corner room with a king bed.if this pan pacific property remind you of a hyatt , with its vertical interior atrium room arrangement , it be because it be a portman pre-hyatt design .<ssssss>lot of thick wall , thick marble , thick circle .<ssssss>the room themselves be large and reasonable , but date .<ssssss>bathroom be generous but very family affair/buffy/jody in they decor - too much almond/beige , include all fixture .<ssssss>the tv in the room be far too small and , with only standard-definition signal come in , the result be a too-soft , smeared picture.this be not a hotel to stay in for any view of the city.additional snarky service be experience at the hotel bar and by the concierge .<ssssss>my colleague ask the concierge if he have any tape to secure a box .<ssssss>without look up , the employee rummage in a drawer , produce a roll of plastic tape , place it on the counter , and go back to they paperwork .<ssssss>for this class of hotel , one expect at least certainly sir , here you go ; would you like I to secure that ?<ssssss>do you need it send anywhere ?<ssssss>be evidently beyond the comprehension of the employee .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 3 1 1 1		just poor !<ssssss>this be my second time in this hotel , another 2-week stay .<ssssss>unfortunately that one be not up to the price pay .<ssssss>i have request a golf-view room ; i get one , nice although overlook the two huge air conditioning hotel fan which be constantly work and particularly noisy .<ssssss>so i request another one and be grant a room on the 3rd floor right above the ballroom .<ssssss>extremely bad location , and unfortunately no other room available !<ssssss>party be go on friday , saturday , sunday , monday etc. with music playing until very late in the night , in fact early in the morning .<ssssss>terrible when you be there for business .<ssssss>neighbour in adjacent room be particularly noisy , which demonstrate poor room insulation .<ssssss>it be almost impossible to enjoy the pool which do not open until 8am -lrb- it be suppose to open as soon as 7am -rrb- and would be instantly crowd by horde of bawl kid .<ssssss>in addition , the internet connection never work in my room and be never fix although raise to the hotel staff ; and you get to pay for it every day !<ssssss>breakfast quality be hardly average , and personnel at front desk be overall not really care .<ssssss>also , avoid use the laundry service , as my shirt be deliver with damage button !<ssssss>finally , the food in the restaurant appear to be overprice ; and so be parking .<ssssss>be that because mid-may be just a bad period ?<ssssss>i be really unsure and be overall quite disappointed .<ssssss>it be unlikely i will stay there a third time , although the hotel location be great .<ssssss>
3 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		budget hotel , good location excellent location -lrb- about 5 minute from the train station and less than a minute to the duomo -rrb- .<ssssss>good value .<ssssss>we have a double with ensuite .<ssssss>the room be large enough and the bathroom be fine.a few thing to keep in mind : - very friendly and helpful staff .<ssssss>- the elevator be a little tempermental , so you sometimes have to walk up several floor .<ssssss>- we stay in november , so there be not a need for air conditioning .<ssssss>however , i do not see any air conditioning ... only a fan .<ssssss>that be something to keep in mind for summer .<ssssss>- free internet access and reasonably price drink -lrb- soda , juice , beer , etc -rrb- in the lobby area.bottom line be that it be a clean , reasonably price hotel in a great location .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 4 5 -1		amazing location , great staff , mediocre room stay there for a recent weekend trip .<ssssss>the location be perfect , and within walk distance to theatre , restaurant , bar , and shop .<ssssss>staff also be very nice .<ssssss>guest be young , hip , and attractive .<ssssss>and the best part be vip access , albeit expensive , cellar bar .<ssssss>the only downside , which for I be a major one , be that the room be much like a ramada inn with a uncomfortable platform bed .<ssssss>start at $ 400 + a night , i think you might be able to find better for you money -lrb- i.e. , royalton , hudson , or dream -rrb- .<ssssss>

3 2 4 5 5 4 4 5		not all experience be perfect i loooove looove love the ritz carlton product , and especially look forward to stay there twice a year when visit san francisco .<ssssss>many of the thing i adore about this property have not change but unfortunately some important thing have slip .<ssssss>for this visit , my reservation be make directly through the hotel two month prior to my stay .<ssssss>i call direct in order to book a specific room -- which i like very much in the past -- or a room in the same approximate corridor offer a similar view .<ssssss>this be not a difficult request due to the size of this property and number of room that fit this description - if my first choice be not available , i be hope for a exterior view and be not restrict by budget .<ssssss>i also request two dinner reservation for this visit .<ssssss>when i arrive at the hotel and check in , i inquire about the location of the room and be tell it be interior face .<ssssss>this be not what i have request or ideal .<ssssss>i ask the young woman at the front desk about my special request and she say it could not be accomodate as the hotel be quite book .<ssssss>i ask if they might have a higher category room or suite available .<ssssss>unfortunately , she tell I there be no other option .<ssssss>not happy about the sitaution , but still happy to be in one of my favorite place i succumb and head off to my room.things go along as they usually do ... lovely flower , pleasant staff , well maintain facility , nice display of food and drink -lrb- on the concierge floor -rrb- and the expect top notch ritz carlton sf experience .<ssssss>day two after hoof it around the city all day we return to the hotel to get ready for dinner and have a message in regard to we dinner plans-the rc have mistakenly make a 8:00 p.m. dinner reservation for that evening .<ssssss>it be now 5:45 p.m. and the concierge contact the restaurant but unfortunately they be unable to accomodate we .<ssssss>the concierge suggest a few other options-we take she suggestion , and when she phone we back she notify we that the only opening be at 6:45 .<ssssss>unfortunately since it be saturday night we option be limit .<ssssss>we quickly shower and head off to dinner .<ssssss>after return from dinner the concierge greet we and ask how everything be .<ssssss>we tell she the restaurant be very pretty and have a nice atmosphere but the food be just okay .<ssssss>she inquire about what we eat and how the rest of we stay be and we tell she how dissappointed we be with a few thing and then breifly detail the room situation , miss reservation , etc. she then state not all experience be perfect and to contact she in the future so she could assure we would be take care of .<ssssss>hmmmm-can you say stunned ?<ssssss>i think i be sorry or i hope you would enjoy the food more might have cover it more tactfully .<ssssss>i enjoy the remainder of the evening but think wow-did that just happen?it be true , not all experience be perfect but as a frequent traveler i fully well know that .<ssssss>i do not think that line should be utter by a staff member under any circumstance let alone this one especially since i be -lrb- and we be -rrb- just answer she question .<ssssss>people make mistake , and that be why they call they mistake .<ssssss>i be irk but willing to overlook a less than flawless stay .<ssssss>one mediocre visit would not prohibit a future one .<ssssss>i hope it be just a hiccup .<ssssss>all i can figure be the place seem understaffed -lrb- turn down service be occur well after 10:00 p.m. -rrb- , dirty plate and glass be everywhere especially during the morning and cocktail hour .<ssssss>and lastly we request a late check out and that too be something that could not be accomodate .<ssssss>not a big deal but certainly not the expect for $ 600.00 a night .<ssssss>
5 4 5 2 5 5 5 -1		a fabulous time !<ssssss>we love we visit to the ritz carlton san juan .<ssssss>the staff be amazing .<ssssss>we stay in a club room floor with we two child and they could not have be more attentive .<ssssss>the club room include , breakfast , light lunch , afternoon tea , appetizer , and dessert and coffee - wine and mixed drink be also available .<ssssss>we have dinner at the restaurant two night and the second night -lrb- without a reservation -rrb- they remember and welcome we .<ssssss>the second we walk in they greet we back and we waiter from the previous evening come over to say hello .<ssssss>the attention to detail be unbelievable .<ssssss>location be the only downside .<ssssss>
3 5 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		price/location combo make this place unbeatable let I preface this review by say that i be a resident of hong kong , and in fact own a flat on robinson road .<ssssss>during the renovation of we flat , we be frequent guest at the bishop lei as it about 2 block from we flat .<ssssss>let I also say that this be not normally the type of hotel i would consider - i be ridiculously picky.having say all of that , i challenge you to find a hotel in hong kong that be more conveniently located for the price they charge .<ssssss>yes , you have to step outside to change you mind in the small room .<ssssss>yes , they be basic .<ssssss>but they be clean , comfortable , and for $ 500hkd/night -lrb- $ 65us -rrb- you can not touch it anywhere else in hong kong .<ssssss>and besides , if you be do much more than sleep in the room , you have miss the point of a visit to hong kong.just one other note to refute a prior review - while it be true that they do not provide bottled water in the room , it be in fact untrue that the water be not potable .<ssssss>tap water be perfectly safe in hong kong .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 5 3 4 -1		great location i be pretty scare after read some of the review .<ssssss>we be on the 14th floor and we room be great , we view be awesome !<ssssss>no you be not say at the hilton or some fancy hotel but it be a nice hotel .<ssssss>i have spend more money and stay at worse place .<ssssss>we stay be great and would do it again in the same hotel<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 3 3 2 -1		great location , spoil by detail we have a 2 night stay at the quo in may .<ssssss>we choose it from review here and because of its ' location at the edge of the old town.it be perfect for walk to all the must see site but also 100 metre from the madrid vision tour bus route .<ssssss>we walk both morning and do the red and blue route each afternoon.we have a fabulous meal at la terrace in the casino de madrid .<ssssss>we have the degustation menu and the food and service be out of this world .<ssssss>it be only 200 metre from the hotel.we book the superior double room on the top floor which have a roof terrace with great view over the neighbouring roof top .<ssssss>on the sunday night there be a thunder storm and the lightning be spectacular.the room be quiet at night and the twin bed be comfortable.we pay extra for a acceptable breakfast but agree there be plenty of place close by that be much cheaper.problems in the room that let the hotel down be : the blind at the french window onto the terrace would not wind all the way up prevent the door open properly ; one of the sunlounger be break ; there be a trouser press but nowhere to plug it in to ; there be a faulty light on the desk ; i pre-ordered champagne to be deliver on we first night as a surprise - it be forgotten.because it be a weekend nothing be fix until the monday morning we be leave .<ssssss>it be not good enough for a 4 * hotel to have such defect in the room .<ssssss>no reduction be make to the bill.recommended because of its ' location .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 5 2 4 -1		we have a great time !<ssssss>.<ssssss>desert<ssssss>
4 2 4 5 5 3 5 -1		awesome place ... just dont be ignorant this be we first trip ever outside of canada and it be a wanderful experience !<ssssss>we tip generously to the bar tender -lrb- mainly the 1 -rrb- and he be always make sure we have fresh drink in we hand even if we didnt ' ask , i would walk up to the bar and he would already be make my drink .<ssssss>my boyfriend and i be way too trust in the sense of money .<ssssss>we go shopping on the resort and buy quite a bit from one particular store .<ssssss>the boyfriend be charge $ 23us but inform we that he only accept peso so he kindly convert and we get we credit card and use the atm pay he what we think be $ 23 but in reality when we get home be $ 147 we .<ssssss>aswell with I i be tell $ 235us and knock it down to $ 200 we but once again do not accept we dollar so i do the same thing this time in reality pay he $ 488 !<ssssss>so know you exchange and dont trust they to do it for you , there be nothing we can do about we loss try to not let it happen to you : -rrb- other than that we would 100 % think about go again to this lovely resort .<ssssss>
2 3 3 -1 2 -1 1 -1		nice place ... worst service ever !!<ssssss>wow , never have i witness service that bad in a 4 * hotel.the staff over there pretend you do not exist .<ssssss>transfer 7 time on the phone for a question regard golf .<ssssss>i mean , i do not consider myself a demand client , but i have my limits.everything over there be a special order , from the bottle of water at the bar to have you room clean more than once in a two week stay.not impressed .<ssssss>i will probably never go back to a sol melia hotel just because of that .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 4 3 1		modern and stylish sofitel in a nice location the location be just fantastic -lrb- and probably the reason for the price tag -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be nice , clean and stylish but small .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable.the only surprise be to find such a small tv and not even plasma/lcd -lrb- not that i watch it -rrb- .<ssssss>the fruit i get as a preferred guest look in quite bad shape and they go directly into the trash bin .<ssssss>the bathroom -lrb- shower only -rrb- and its huge door be not very practical.there 's a small wellness section on the 7th floor with a sauna -lrb- not sure it work properly that day -rrb- and a steam bath -lrb- very nice -rrb- .<ssssss>the hot tub be either broken -lrb- or not open yet - a saturday at 10am -rrb- .<ssssss>the view over the roof be quite nice and so be the small fitness center.i have not test any of the restaurant nor breakfast as we spend most of the time in the city and clubbing , and just use the hotel as a place to crash.what i really do not understand be why they have only one internet over wifus provider -lrb- with no alternative -rrb- who want to charge 30eur for 24h !<ssssss>this be unacceptable these day especially as you could not use any roaming partner and they seem to filter protocol like voip ...<ssssss>
2 2 3 3 2 1 1 1		awful service my husband , myself , and we three year old son just return from a five day stay to the el conquistador .<ssssss>although , the resort have be recently renovate , the service be in need of a major renovation .<ssssss>in all of we travels we have never experience such poor service.upon get to we room we find the safe to be lock .<ssssss>it take five hour and a couple of phone call before security manage to come up to the room .<ssssss>as soon as we check in i request extra pillow so i could put they on my son 's bed so he would not fall out .<ssssss>once again , it take numerous phone call .<ssssss>finally someone from housekeeping show up approximately six hour later with one pillow .<ssssss>he could not understand why we be so upset .<ssssss>upon speak to the head of house keep , additional pillow be finally deliver .<ssssss>we know that we be go to pay resort price for food so we be prepare .<ssssss>however , the service in all of the restaurant , especially otello 's be beyond awful .<ssssss>it take approximately 45 minute for they to bring out a plate of chicken finger .<ssssss>we always eat on the earlier side to avoid any crowd and delay when we be out with we son .<ssssss>this be in fairness to he and to everyone else in the restaurant .<ssssss>however , you can not expect a three year old to sit for forty five minute patiently before a meal arrives.we know the hotel be not inexpensive and we do not have any problem with that .<ssssss>however , we expect to get far better service than what we receive .<ssssss>everyone who we speak to say the same thing .<ssssss>many of the people we meet would not return because of the poor service .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 2 3 5 3		amazing time but not 5 star , more like 3.5-4 .<ssssss>the guy at the pizzeria<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		a great deal my husband and i have stay here for we vacation the last two year , and we think it be a great deal .<ssssss>the ocean view and ocean front room provide a absolutely beautiful view of waikiki beach .<ssssss>the lanai be very comfortable and a great place from which to watch the sunset .<ssssss>yes , the room be small , but we have always find they clean .<ssssss>the room have air conditioning , cable tv and a refrigerator .<ssssss>the staff have always be courteous and helpful .<ssssss>we only complaint be that my husband be a light sleeper and be sometimes awaken by the noise of neighbor door close , which he say be quite loud .<ssssss>overall , we have be pleased and would stay here again .<ssssss>it be on the quiet end of waikiki and you can not beat the price .<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 4 -1 5 -1		absolute best service my husband , 9 year old daughter and i just return from 4 night at the mandarin oriental .<ssssss>i can not say enough about the service we receive .<ssssss>here be the highlight : * complimentary wine and tea in we room for we just after arrival * complimentary cheese , cracker and fruit wait for we one evening after a long day sightseeing * concierge have a rental car ready and wait for we within 30 minute of we request * all staff call we by name every time they see we * doorman learn what type of restaurant we like and send we to they in the house carthere be lot of great thing about this hotel : the view , quality of the room , the location but the people there make it a truly special place to stay .<ssssss>it beat the trump , the plaza or the ritz hand down .<ssssss>
3 5 2 4 2 5 4 -1		good ambience .<ssssss>swim pool<ssssss>
4 2 4 -1 4 -1 3 -1		great location , good base , not luxury this hotel have a excellent location just at the top of las ramblas off the plaixa de catalunya .<ssssss>the room be comfortable - some be a bit odd with the sink outside the bathroom in the room itself , so if you do not want this , be sure to book another room .<ssssss>you do not tend to spend too uch time in this hotel but if you do , it have a pleasant seating area/lounge downstairs but it be not really one to hang out in .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable , room clean , there be only one lift so it can be a bit tedious wait so make sure you have be work out you leg !!<ssssss>i would recommend this hotel for a group of people who be just look for a bse to sleep and get ready in and not really to hang out in the hotel .<ssssss>it be pricey for what it actually be so if you step up a few more euro , you may get a better hotel in term of luxury .<ssssss>
4 5 3 2 3 5 5 -1		have a great time my boyfriend and i stay here for 7 night last week -lrb- 15 oct 07 - 23 oct 07 -rrb- .<ssssss>we read load of review before go and find a great cheap deal with directholidays.co.uk .<ssssss>we be unsure on what weather to expect but we have glorious weather all week with only one day of cloud .<ssssss>it be hot all week -lrb- day and night -rrb- but the room have air con so it be lovely .<ssssss>it probably rain every day but do not cause a problem and be only ever a quick shower.i have mix opinion on what we find compare to some of the other review i have read .<ssssss>we be not mad keen on the ` animacion ' team .<ssssss>the american and spanish seem to like they but they take over the pool at the same time of day everyday playing game that i never ever understand ... i try to work out what be go on but it be mostly in spanish so have trouble .<ssssss>people seem to like they though !<ssssss>the american and spanish also seem to enjoy the cheesy music -lrb- eg abba , ymca , grease -rrb- ... sorry bit of a over-generalisation there ... just we observation !<ssssss>at night the animation team take over the lobby bar a couple of time with another weird show which we do not get ... they do it so with rather loud speaker so do take over quite a lot.which bring I on to the nightlife ... or lack of to be honest .<ssssss>the resort do lack a little after dinner time .<ssssss>there be a choice of 2 bar -lrb- lobby or mare nostrum on the beach -rrb- which be both nice but quiet -lrb- if the animation team be not there -rrb- .<ssssss>we struggle a little to entertain ourselves in the dark ... we do go next door to the caribe a few time and they have a beach party one night but other than that seem quiet too .<ssssss>we be not party animal so do not want a rave or anything but it be lack a little something on this front ... on the food topic ... a mixed bag .<ssssss>we try all restaurant on the resort .<ssssss>el rio -lrb- tex mex and steak house -rrb- - food be ok , quite nice , nothing to write home about .<ssssss>fondue -lrb- good fun although service a little slow both time we go there ... best place to eat on the resort in we opinion -rrb- .<ssssss>mare nostrum ... give I a bad stomach for just over a day ... i blame the seafood crepe - can not be sure though i suppose .<ssssss>the seafood be dissapointing to be honest and we do not go there again .<ssssss>el bacio -lrb- italian -rrb- ... not great food and do not go there again .<ssssss>el sombero in next door resort be good and the food be nice there - a close second favourite.during the day the buffet be good .<ssssss>breakfast be in the caribe every day and be good .<ssssss>lot of fresh fruit and fruit juice -lrb- include a favourite to all the woman ... banana milkshake ... they could not refill the jug quick enough ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>there be a guy on the egg counter cooking omelete and egg - really great too .<ssssss>there be a pancake counter with waffle and stuff for the american no doubt ;-rrb- .<ssssss>too sweet for we brit in the morning i think .<ssssss>there be all sort to eat - i be sure everyone would be happy with something.the all-inclusive part be great .<ssssss>free stuff - woohoo !<ssssss>it be a great feeling .<ssssss>beer anytime you like and refill you do not even have to ask for ... great .<ssssss>i be sure some people take advantage but we do not ask for more than we really want .<ssssss>one tip - learn some cocktail name as we do not know any and expect the barman to make you something exciting if you ask !<ssssss>if you ask for a cocktail with rum in it ... you will most likely get a shot -lrb- albeit a large one -rrb- of rum and ice .<ssssss>all drink come in a plastic cup which be fine by we .<ssssss>presidente beer be great too .<ssssss>cocktail that we learn about : meringue -lrb- have a banana liquiore and orange juice and rum i think - one for the girl :-rrb- -rrb- , coco loco -lrb- a white milky one with chocolate sauce -rrb- .<ssssss>we room be in 4000 and face the pool .<ssssss>it be ok but do smell progressively worse as the week go on .<ssssss>it be generally damp and musty which we put down to the fact that the room be in a humid island on the carribean !<ssssss>all the same , i find it more and more unpleasant -lrb- but my boyfriend be less bother -rrb- .<ssssss>they do clean the room everyday and the aircon work well .<ssssss>no other complaint really .<ssssss>the second day we leave a note in a attempt at spanish for more water and presidente beer -lrb- rather than the standard stuff which be not as nice -rrb- .<ssssss>we get it but just the standard beer and water from then on .<ssssss>we leave a nice tip when we leave as they do a great job.on leave we flight be delay by 16 hour -lrb- mytravel ... -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel be wonderful and let we keep we room without question .<ssssss>the even bring we a plate of food on we last night .<ssssss>we do not pay a extra penny and have all-inclusive all day .<ssssss>can not thank they enough for that.i find the resort to be really nice all in all .<ssssss>very clean always , the staff be so polite and friendly and cheerful always - lovely !!<ssssss>there could have be more to do in the evening and the food be not great to be honest but the pool and beach be great .<ssssss>we do not go on any of the excursion and we do not find the water sport place until the last day so do not do that either - maybe we should have.i would recommend this hotel to anyone with the caveat that i have return home feeling as though i have be on a butlin holiday camp and that i really do not see the true domincan republic at all ... perhaps we fault for not do the excursion but a lot of they be a long way away and we do not fancy spending we time sit on a coach .<ssssss>i recommend the people and weather to everyone though !!!<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 4 2 -1		mixed the hotel have good and bad points.bad : we room -lrb- 62 -rrb- , and bathroom be both small .<ssssss>they be o.k. for two people for two night , but i would not want to spend more than a few night in it .<ssssss>it would be o.k. for a single person for a longer stay.the bed be narrow - i think two obese people would be really cramp in it.our bedroom be directly next to the lift which be noisy.the breakfast be nothing special , and at 12 euro per head expensive .<ssssss>-lrb- we have a smaller but nicer breakfast in a historic baker shop near the hotel for under 10 euro for the two of we -rrb- .<ssssss>the lady serve breakfast be not friendly , and seem put out when i ask -lrb- in french -rrb- for plate and a clean glass.good : we have superb view of the eiffel tower from we bedroom and bathroom.the room and bathroom be clean , mould free and nicely decorated.the hotel be s short walk from the eiffel tower , and les invalides and other tourist site be within walk distance.all the receptionist , night auditor and manager be polite and friendly.the hotel be about ten minute walk from ecole militaire mÃ©tro station.the hotel be in a smart , but at the same time lively area with shop and restaurants.if you would like the superb eiffel tower view , ask for room 64 .<ssssss>this be next to ours , but not next to the lift .<ssssss>however , you would not have the view from the bathroom!this be a good hotel , but i could not say fantastic .<ssssss>perhaps my expectation be too high have read some of the other review here .<ssssss>

3 2 3 2 4 5 5 -1		decent place - plus and minus dream punta cana be definitely not a 6 apple resort .<ssssss>we book this place on the 6-apple square deal expect a real bargain .<ssssss>sorry to say that we get exactly what we pay for .<ssssss>the resort be not horrible , certainly not a nightmare , but it be also not the luxurious experience that they make it out to be .<ssssss>it be a amstar resort , own by apple , which be why apple rate it 6 star .<ssssss>do not be fool .<ssssss>the ride from the airport be horrible ... we take a shorter route that actually take 1.5 hour and involved numerous people get sick .<ssssss>on the way back , we take the long way and end up get to the airport in 1 hour with no one sick .<ssssss>make sure you tell you rep not to take the short way !<ssssss>check in be great , but we room be not 6-star by any stretch of the imagination .<ssssss>there be a huge crack in we ceiling that run clear across the room , and the closet and face of the furniture be in generally bad shape .<ssssss>the bathroom be ok , but the shower be weird and hot water be sketchy .<ssssss>we maid be excellent , and we do not tip until the last day .<ssssss>we also give she some school supplies for she child and she love it !<ssssss>think about bring they a little something :-rrb- we also have a problem with we ac , which be fix within 1 hour .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>the pool be great , but i do get a ear infection from it and it screw up my swimming for the last 4 day .<ssssss>you will also find loser gather raft every morning to hoard for the rest of the day ... such a shame that people act this way .<ssssss>the beach be pretty right in front of the resort , but the water be rough , not clear at all , and there be sharp rock all throughout the ocean so swim be hardly possible .<ssssss>no snorkel opportunity , and other be right -- a ton of trash all over the place .<ssssss>a real shame , they certainly can not tout they beach as top of the line , as i have have better beach in jamaica , dominica , bahama , and at excellence punta cana , etc. restaurant be very good generally , with good food and great service .<ssssss>the desert be straight from the buffet , however ... very disappointing .<ssssss>the buffet be terrible ... food selection be very limited , none of the food be good , and they run out of everything .<ssssss>bacon be like gold at breakfast ... patio , himitsu , and seaside grill be great , very good food .<ssssss>we service be always exceptional .<ssssss>show be ok , i do not put much stock into they anyway .<ssssss>overall , best thing about this resort be the service , and the worst be the beach/buffet .<ssssss>it be not a 6-star by any means , so be prepare .<ssssss>you can certainly enjoy yourself , but do not think you be get any special deal with the 6-star .<ssssss>you will get excellent service , however !<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 4 3 3 -1		lackluster luxury-ish i be accustom to stay in nyc hotel of this category , and at first sight , the palace stand tall .<ssssss>the building , the lobby and all public area be outstanding .<ssssss>i stay in a room which be $ 545 , probably among they lower price room -- but still , it represent a severe drop in quality from my first impression .<ssssss>it be basically a completely ordinary room , ordinary furnishings , cheap old fashion tv , nothing whatsoever which would give you the impression of any level of luxury .<ssssss>the bedding be well below the standard of the chain hotel which seem to pride themselves on bedding these day .<ssssss>the palace bed have thin , cheap feeling linen , a completely average blanket , all what you might expect at the most ordinary sheraton .<ssssss>even the bathroom lotion and potion be ordinary , private label , just like you would find in a hilton or marriot .<ssssss>there be not even a thermostat in the room !<ssssss>i should add that the lobby staff be abundant with bellhop , but every time i need they , i have to interrupt they constant chatter among themselves .<ssssss>and finally , at checkout , there be $ 60 of food charge to my account which i have never purchase .<ssssss>they fix it , but still , this be not how fine hotel operate .<ssssss>take a look at the st. regi if you would like to enjoy luxury do right at a similiar price .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 2 3 -1		mixed opinion ... i stay at the hotel over christmas 2008 .<ssssss>i be really look forward to stay there after read all of the review .<ssssss>overall , i do enjoy my stay there and would certainly recommend it to anyone who be look for a nice , clean hotel in a good location .<ssssss>these be just a few of my thought on my stay.positives : it really be in a great location .<ssssss>we walk to bugi village , mustafa , raffle , orchard road , the flyer , fort canning and chinatown from the hotel .<ssssss>the room be very clean and comfortable .<ssssss>i really enjoy the buffet breakfast .<ssssss>some of the staff be really friendly and helpful .<ssssss>consider the price of hotel be singapore , this be really well priced.negatives : you need to give they you key whenever you leave the hotel , this be not a problem when leave -lrb- you just put it into a slot -rrb- ; however , it do get annoying when it be busy at reception and you have to wait in a queue to get the key back again .<ssssss>the woman who take the voucher for breakfast and get the coffee be very rude and make thing a bit difficult .<ssssss>they also only accept cash which i thought be a bit strange.i would recommend this hotel to other due to the cleanliness , price and location .<ssssss>however , i be not sure if i would stay there again , there be so many hotel in good location i would prefer somewhere else .<ssssss>
5 5 5 4 4 3 3 3		a luxury room for a budget price i stay at the altamont with my girlfriend early march 2007 , and be very impressed by the experience.the room we be give genuinely be of luxury hotel quality : high ceiling , huge comfy bed , and big ensuite , and all for only aus $ 110 per night .<ssssss>great location too : close enough to the colour of king cross and to the cbd , without be bang in the middle of it.i would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone come to sydney .<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 5 3 4 3		a quite good hotel i be from hk so actually do not think the balinese style in the hotel be not such balinese ... e.g. the lake beside the restuaurant with breadfast , it really decorate in a chinese style indeed.the top of all the house in bali be like the style in ancient chinese.the balus ppl be very polite and nice , the beach near hotel be clean and good view.overall , bali be a good place to have a relaxing vocation , except the high living standard .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 2 3 3 -1		run away expedia rate this as a 4 star hotel , which be horribly misleading .<ssssss>i wish i have read review on this site prior to booking .<ssssss>the hotel be advertise as be newly refurbish with luxurious room .<ssssss>the first room we be take to have only a shower , and barely enough room to set down we bag .<ssssss>it be not newly refurbish by any means .<ssssss>the second room we be show be again , extremely small , and very hot .<ssssss>i ask why the air conditioning be not on , and be tell they turn it off during this time of the year .<ssssss>the small window on the slant ceiling open minimally and be of no help .<ssssss>we ask again to be move to one of they luxurious suite -lrb- as advertise on they website -rrb- and be tell they have no such thing as a suite in that hotel .<ssssss>the only good thing i would say about this hotel be that the manager have enough sense to call expedia to assist with get we reservation change .<ssssss>

4 3 2 5 5 4 5 5		great location and clean hotel i love the location for this hotel in san francisco .<ssssss>you do not need to rent a car because you have all the transportation around you need at all time of the day and night .<ssssss>we also take numerous tour which pick we up in front of the hotel .<ssssss>if you decide to rent a car the rate per night at the hotel w/tax be approx .<ssssss>$ 42.00 .<ssssss>the holiday inn express be very clean and unusually large and soundproof .<ssssss>the bed should be upgrade because they have see many year of abuse .<ssssss>we use we point and do not have to pay anything and be put in a mini suite which include a fridge and microwave .<ssssss>the view be of the wharf from we room but be we be on the run the entire week it be a pleasure to come back and leave from that location .<ssssss>the breakfast could be better and maybe more of it be you have a lot of people from other country who take advantage of fill bag for dessert - i blame this on all of san francisco who charge ridiculous price for all food especially breakfast .<ssssss>i be tell denny 's around the corner charge for 3 people a average of $ 72.00 .<ssssss>new york be much cheaper than this city .<ssssss>also , the homeless be out of control every place you walk in the best of area they be beg , try to touch you and sleep in the street .<ssssss>in fact they be out of control and make it very uncomfortable because no police and very little security around .<ssssss>they be even outside of the hotel but i feel fine because i have my husband and 15 year old son with I .<ssssss>if i be alone it would not be enjoyable .<ssssss>when you stand on the line for the trolley car they be grab on to you and beg .<ssssss>every park , every landmark , every place there be ton and ton of they even sleep on the trolly 's before they roll out in the am .<ssssss>i be interested in take one of the trolley 's and step on the bus because i think one of they work for the transit and almost get corner by 4 of they until my husband come behind I .<ssssss>this city be not safe for single woman .<ssssss>i think they need to stop protect they and clean up san francisco because it be a beautiful place to visit .<ssssss>everyone we meet feel the same way in fact one woman from england go to the baseball giant game the same night we attend and 3 of these homeless man sit next to they and every time they move the homeless follow they until one fall and split open he chin and be bleed but refuse help and paramedic leave the scene .<ssssss>i call they bum and almost get my head chop off by many of the tour guide that we take trip with .<ssssss>one place we stop to take a picture i walk with my son ahead of my husband and he feel someone right behind he when he pick up the bag that we be carry and think it be I but instead have a homeless right in he face .<ssssss>if people would stop visit they would have no choice but to do something about it .<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		good location , adequate accommodation the location of this hotel - right on circular quay and a short walk from the rock and pitt street mall - be absolutely perfect for my first visit to the city .<ssssss>the hotel give a good service , although i feel the room need update , and after tasting the food we soon find other place to eat .<ssssss>the only problem we have be be disturb at 9am by housekeeping on we last day , somewhat unnecessarily as we be check out that day !<ssssss>not a welcome intrusion when you be try to get some sleep in preparation for a long-haul flight.apart from that there be no problem , and the staff be attentive and friendly .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 3 2 -1 4		noise noise noise !!!!<ssssss>i be not sure what the normal rate be for this hotel -- we pay $ 189/night and i think it should have cost more like $ 50 .<ssssss>the room be clean , however , the hotel 's wall be paper thin .<ssssss>we could hear the people next to we , the people above we , the people below we , the people in the hall and all the noise from the surround area -lrb- traffic , people yell , siren , etc. -rrb- .<ssssss>this place be just way too noisy .<ssssss>it be awful .<ssssss>i pay $ 167 -lrb- get a deal - yes -rrb- at the westin market street and it be phenomenal -- clean , quiet , temperature control , etc. 100x better for you buck .<ssssss>also - unlike the westin - hotel carlton have no mini bar or refrigerator , no a/c .<ssssss>free internet at hotel carlton be a plus - but can not make up for the rest of the nightmare .<ssssss>i mean seriously - i would rather pay $ 10 for internet than not get any sleep b/c of all the chaos surround I .<ssssss>

2 2 3 5 3 2 4 -1		book a kingsize room ?<ssssss>so what ???<ssssss>have stay at the heritage marina a couple of year ago , when we be pleasantly surprise by the facility , and amaze by the fabulous breakfast buffet , we be a bit disappointed with it when we return this year.yes , it be a bit run down in the corridor and stairway , but this be a budget hotel .<ssssss>however , the breakfast option have now be reduce to cereal , bagel and pastry , and that be about it .<ssssss>the worst thing however , be that have book a deluxe kingsize room , we arrive at the hotel around 7.30 pm to be tell that they have no kingsize bed room leave so we be to have a room with a single queen size bed instead.on query this , we be tell that although you reserve a room online , they be allocate on a first come , first serve basis , so you may or may not get what you reserve .<ssssss>dreadful woman on reception by the way , who just keep say there be no more kingsize room leave , with no attempt to apologise.i ask if the rate would be lower then , and i have to say that they do eventually rearrange thing so that we get a kingsize bed , but it be not easy , and i know that other traveller have the same issue , and they be not as lucky as we .<ssssss>other than that , the room be clean and the bed be comfy - the lady who come to clean we room also help we when we door refuse to open !<ssssss>however , although we have coffee and coffee maker , no milk / creamer , sugar etc. !<ssssss>they also forget to replace coffee and toilet roll .<ssssss>

2 2 2 1 2 1 2 5		check you bill carefully this be a beautiful resort , but i have major problem with the front desk .<ssssss>we airport transfer be suppose to be include in the room rate -- although when i arrive , they want I to pay we $ 30 -lrb- after originally fail to meet we -rrb- .<ssssss>when i depart , there be another charge for we $ 20 for we return trip to the airport .<ssssss>i contest both and they drop they without much complaint as if it happen all the time -lrb- i.e. they be clearly pad the bill -rrb- .<ssssss>also , they advertise a discount if you pay with american express , but then refuse to grant it to I , originally deny the promotion exist , then say it be only at one specific restaurant .<ssssss>-lrb- there be brochure for the promotion at a few place in the resort -rrb- when i ask to speak to the manager or assistant manager , they say they be in a meeting and could not speak with I .<ssssss>after 30 minute of try to work out the problem , they refuse to honor the discount they advertise , refuse repeatedly to call the manager , and i have to rush off to the airport .<ssssss>i follow up with a complaint and they reply i must have misunderstand the brochure -lrb- although it be in english and i be a native speaker -- they be not -rrb- .<ssssss>that say , the resort grounds be beautiful and spa/gym nice although the location be far from other place of interest in bali -lrb- 1 hour from ubud and 1-1/2 hour to kuta -- depend on traffic and if the resort 's driver have to stop for petrol . -rrb-<ssssss>the restaurant be fine , although we have have much better breakfast buffet elsewhere in asia .<ssssss>room need upgrade - - pretty gross stain on the chair .<ssssss>if it be not for the problem with the bill and the refusal to honor they own discount , i would say this place be fine .<ssssss>but , i will not stay there again .<ssssss>if you do , check you bill carefully !!<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 2 3 3 3		not value for money same problem as everyone else : i book the smallest room they have and that room be so ridiculously tiny that i could easily get room that be double or triple that size for the same price elsewhere in singapore .<ssssss>you do shower standing right next to the toilet and the water leak out of the door into you room .<ssssss>the result puddle be 1 step away from my bed .<ssssss>the garbage truck arrive early in the morning and there be no soundproofing .<ssssss>breakfast be slow , cold and sad - the coffee be worse than nescafe instant coffee .<ssssss>the chair be beautiful , as be the lobby but the room make I feel too claustrophobic .<ssssss>there be many other much better alternative in singapore .<ssssss>i only plan to stay one night , but it be not a great night .<ssssss>not recommend !<ssssss>
4 2 4 4 5 3 4 3		a for effort this be my first time book a entire trip through expedia.com and i have to say i be pleased .<ssssss>all of the voucher you need to print out go over very smoothly -lrb- apart from a parking voucher , which turn out to be for a park n ' ride that we do not park in ; a $ 144 mistake ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>most of the next comment echo what other reviewer have mention already , so i guess i would just like to reiterate .<ssssss>one of the plus be that the resort be only 15-20 min .<ssssss>from the punta cana airport .<ssssss>some of the other be up to 45min to a hour away .<ssssss>the hotel and grounds be very very nice .<ssssss>i be impressed .<ssssss>it be a fairly big place -lrb- to walk from we room , which be close to the beach , to the lobby/dining area take about 5-10 minute -rrb- with many little hotel building .<ssssss>everyday there be so many groundskeeper and clean staff , most who greet you with a smile and a hola .<ssssss>i be also pleasantly surprise with we room .<ssssss>a good size with nice amenity .<ssssss>yes , the shower be small , and in the same room as the toilet .<ssssss>but you get a nice big round bathtub in the other washroom as well .<ssssss>the balcony be great !<ssssss>the one bad thing be the bed .<ssssss>very hard !!!<ssssss>i really enjoy the beach area .<ssssss>they do a great job make that look nice .<ssssss>lot 's of palm tree , lot of lounge chair , lot of white sand .<ssssss>the ocean water be somewhat clear , but they do need to remove seaweed every morning to make this possible .<ssssss>not a big deal .<ssssss>warn !!!<ssssss>: there be many european there during we stay , which seem to be the time european travel more .<ssssss>have travel to place like australia , bali a thailand , i be use to see woman sunbathe with they top off .<ssssss>but i be sure most american be not .<ssssss>if you have kid , you may want to take note of this .<ssssss>the pool area be probably one of the main focal point of the resort .<ssssss>i like the beach better cuz it be more relaxing , but the pool area be great .<ssssss>nice big bar area , half you can walk up to and the other half you can swim up to .<ssssss>latin music play loudly all day long with cheerful bartender .<ssssss>the pool itself be really big , go off in different direction .<ssssss>get a shaded spot be tough on both the beach and pool , but i do not want shade .<ssssss>food : in all honesty , i enjoy the buffet the best .<ssssss>there be so many choice to pick from and it be pretty good , in my opinion .<ssssss>fresh fruit , lot of cold salad , omelette station , station where they cook chicken or steak for you , pizza , pasta , rice , potato and vegetable dish .<ssssss>sadly i only go to breakfast once and really enjoy the breakfast .<ssssss>the ` fine dining ' restaurant be a little annoying .<ssssss>while the idea be great , they fall well short of what they aim for .<ssssss>they rotate which night certain one be even open .<ssssss>you have to go to this customer service desk and pick which night you want to eat and at what time .<ssssss>they stress closed shoe and pants for guy , which to I be stupid .<ssssss>we only make it to the american , japanese and mexican restaurant .<ssssss>i think i like the mexican the best .<ssssss>japanese be second and the american be just ... .<ssssss>sad .<ssssss>the french one be close when we be there .<ssssss>i hear good thing about the italian one which we fail to get to .<ssssss>oh , and the snack bar by the pool be good .<ssssss>it do the job .<ssssss>the pizza be really good !<ssssss>the roasted chicken be good too .<ssssss>they also have hot dog , french fries and tortilla chip with cheese saucethere be plenty of activity to try to get involve with and the animation team be pretty good at it .<ssssss>they work long hour everyday and have so much energy .<ssssss>i play a good 2 on 2 volleyball game one afternoon with one of the animation team guy and 2 european guy .<ssssss>i definitely would have take advantage of the tennis court and basketball court , but relaxing be just too good !<ssssss>there be also 2 pool table and a ping pong table near the lobby bar .<ssssss>we go to the disco one night .<ssssss>it be pretty cool inside there , and i can imagine during spring break time it be nut .<ssssss>there be a big dance floor in the middle with bar table seat around .<ssssss>i think this resort be somewhere between 3 and a half and 4 star .<ssssss>if it be not for the restaurant food , i would give it 4 .<ssssss>but food be a important part of vacation and sadly , it just be not up to par .<ssssss>but the grounds be wonderful , the pool be fun and the beach be great !<ssssss>i would really recommend this place for couple who be travel with group of friend .<ssssss>i would not say it be the most romantic place i have be to , but it work fine for a week getaway i suppose .<ssssss>but if friend be with , i think it would be a blast .<ssssss>tour : we take 2 tour .<ssssss>saona island -lrb- $ 85 pp -rrb- and santo domingo -lrb- $ 70 pp -rrb- .<ssssss>i have to say i be very disappointed with saona island after read so many good review .<ssssss>they take you to some very cool spot on the speed boat where the water be electric blue and teal and green .<ssssss>but the island itself do nothing for I .<ssssss>the rainy season definitely mean the mosquito be out and no joke , i have 5-10 bite on my back while go up to get something to drink once .<ssssss>you be fine in the sun on the beach , but when you have to go into the tree where the food/drink be , be careful .<ssssss>i be sure it be fine in the dry season .<ssssss>we really enjoy santo domingo .<ssssss>i be fascinate see other city and culture so this trip be great .<ssssss>it be a very long day though ... .<ssssss>we leave the resort at 6:25 and do not get back until 8:30 .<ssssss>it be over 3 hour to get to santo domingo from punta cana , but the tour guide do a pretty good job talk about a lot of thing most of the way .<ssssss>you also have to put up with a lot of people come up to you try to sell thing .<ssssss>but i be use to this and it be not a problem .<ssssss>you just have to be comfortable say no , gracia .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 4 5 4 2		biggest and quietest room i have have in nyc just to endorse other ' positive comment -- we room be spacious enough for we family of four ; the bed and bedding be high quality , and the staff be courteous .<ssssss>despite be next to the elevator , the room be very quiet - almost no street noise whatever .<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 1 3 4 1		jarring ... i can find a million reason to crib about the hard rock hotel in balus .<ssssss>the fact that it stand in stark contrast to the cultural , aesthetic and architectural beauty of balus , the fact that it be located in the only area of balus that i thought be truly disgusting , the lacklustre , crowd beach in front , the fact that one need to weave one way thru a 20 minute traffic jam to get in or outâ€ $ ?<ssssss>i could go on and on .<ssssss>however , i be aware of all this before i even book the hotel -lrb- and as youâ€™ve probably guess , do not really stay here out of choice ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>therefore , i come with rather few expectation .<ssssss>at the very least , i be expect a reasonably luxurious , clean room that i could shut myself in if need be .<ssssss>but hrh fail to meet even those threadbare expectations.we -lrb- a group of 10 ` young adult ' -rrb- move from a beautiful , tranquil villa complex in umala into hard rock .<ssssss>we be initially book at the villa for 5 day , but after a friend eagerly recommend and plead we stay at hard rock , we reluctantly decide to give it a try for 2 day .<ssssss>we move from paradise at 70 $ â€™s to a hell of we own making at double the price.my complaint about the room and hotel be too many , and i really donâ€™t want to get into detail , in a nutshell : crappy reception , jarring corridor , tacky 70â€™s style room , bathroom amenity that one would expect in 2 * hotel .<ssssss>iâ€™ll give the devil itâ€™s due : the swimming pool complex be stunning and the member of the staff like everywhere else in indonesia be sincere and warm.the hard rock would be a disappointment anywhere , but if i consider the fact that remarkably stunning property be available at the same price elsewhere in balus , i feel cheated and angry .<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great concept , decor but noisy , weird ick smell i love the location and feel of this hotel but the room be definitely not soundproof , as advertise .<ssssss>all night long big truck seem to be noisily lumber by and it sound like trash be endlessly be pick up .<ssssss>but this tend to make you get up early and take advantage of the neighborhood .<ssssss>check out grace cathedral and the indoor and outdoor labyrinth .<ssssss>and you can lay out you day geographicallly from there too .<ssssss>chinatown and all the neighborhood be also interesting in the early hours.but i digress .<ssssss>i think the real turnoff for I be the odd odor on my floor -lrb- 4th -rrb- and in my room .<ssssss>i have a zen den and although it be small , it be perfect for one person and very interesting .<ssssss>but that smell ... as i lay awaken in the middle of the night by the all the truck noise i have thought of legionnaire 's disease and spore insidiously creep through my system .<ssssss>it be disconcert , to say the least.i will be up in sf on business all fall/winter and may give the triton another shot .<ssssss>but i will try other kimpton 's first .<ssssss>my only other experience have be with the hotel george in dc -- just wonderful.if you so end up here , check out akiko 's , right around the corner , for incredible japanese food .<ssssss>beautiful presentation and very eclectic / artistic space.sf be incredible ... enjoy !<ssssss>

4 4 5 3 5 4 3 5		nice hotel the inside do not look like the outside .<ssssss>seem the hotel have be refurbish not too long ago , the interior design be nice.the room and bathroom be modern and clean .<ssssss>we do not have to wait long to check-in/out , but give the size of the hotel i would except some queue during peak hours.the restaurant serve good food but pricey -lrb- for berlin -rrb- and the service be very chaotic -lrb- they keep forget we order and mix they -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel provide free wifus internet access , always a bonus point .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 4 3 2 4		ideal location for famile on 1st inpression you would not be too impressed with the lay out of the hotel , there be a really small front desk with no area for socialise , but the room be huge for new york standard , very clean .<ssssss>we have a 2 b/room suite and find it to be a ideal base for we visit .<ssssss>it be in a great location and within walk distance to many attraction .<ssssss>you be only around the corner from the waldorf marriott hotel and these we find be lovely to go and have a few drink people watch , as i be say there be no facility to have a tea or coffee in the reception area in this establishment .<ssssss>there be a italian resturant next door to it , but this be exspensive and the food be only okay and not good value for money .<ssssss>much better place to eat .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the breakfast they deliver to the room be lovely and if there be anything that you want more of , there only too happy to supply you with more .<ssssss>just one down fall on the place be that this be a non smoking hotel , bit of a pain when you have to keep go up and down the lift every time .<ssssss>not sure if i would return to this place as i would like some where in the evening to go to and just relax and have a drink or two<ssssss>

2 2 4 4 2 1 3 2		not worth the money i be write a long review , so if you be busy , here be the bottom line : there be better deal than this hotel.when i make a reservation in a world famous hilton resort hotel chain , pay a certain amount of money , there be a certain expectation , but this hotel do not meet my expectation.first impression : my first impression of this hotel be that it be old and crowded .<ssssss>i see wear and tear , here and there , although we room in the tower seem new.location : the location be good for old san juan and ashford avenue , and about one hour or more one-way drive to the biobay , scuba diving , ferry for vieque , or el yunque , which be ok.however , it be not easy to find a market or a restaurant nearby.room and tower : we tower room be nice and new.our bed throw have black spot here and there , which i strongly suspect as mold , so we never use the throw .<ssssss>other bedding stuff be good and comfortable.the bathroom do not have a bathtub and ventilation , which be a minus , but have a nice shower system with good hot water pressure.no minibar , which translate to a free empty refrigerator.the tower do not have any security , so anyone from the street could go in and out freely .<ssssss>also it be a little bit away from the private beach or the swimming pool.beach and swimming area : the swimming pool be ok but do not look as good as other resort hotel ' pool i visit include other hilton although it do not matter for I because i spend time not in the pool but on the beach.the private beach be good and safe for child as it be protect by a breakwater or something .<ssssss>there be some float thing to climb up and enjoy , and a sunbathe balcony on the sea .<ssssss>although it be crowd , we have a good time on the beach.food : everything be overprice .<ssssss>one bottle of bud light will cost you $ 8 + tax + tip .<ssssss>a mcdonald quality hamburger be $ 13 + tax + tip at a bar , and it be the cheapest snack you can get in the hotel except starbuck , which be the only place with reasonable price in this hotel.if the food quality be good , we would not complain about the price because we be on vacation and ready to spend some .<ssssss>however , we do not want to pay that money for this quality of food , so we always drive out to eat and to shop for the next day 's breakfast.btw , this hotel claim that its pool bar be the birth place of the pina colada .<ssssss>if you want to try it , it be $ 13 + tax + tips.staff : most of the staff be friendly and nice except for the front desk manager .<ssssss>the concierge be so helpful , and even house keeper be always smile although they be not good at english .<ssssss>however , when i be in trouble , the front desk manager be very unhelpful and give I a why-should-i-be-bothered-about-your-fault attitude .<ssssss>how she neglect I really astounded I .<ssssss>fee , parking , internet , etc : you need to pay the additional resort fee -lrb- about 13 or 14 % -rrb- even if you already pay for you room.everything cost you money .<ssssss>i already write about the overpriced food .<ssssss>parking also cost like $ 15 a day , and the parking garage be not connect to the hotel facility which be very bad while rain .<ssssss>internet be also like $ 15 a day .<ssssss>although they say the wireless internet on the lobby be free , we could not get the signal at the lobby and end up pay the money to get the wire access.overall , i be willing to re-visit puerto rico , especially to do the biobay tour again , but i would not stay at this hotel next time .<ssssss>
4 5 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great affordable hotel in waikiki ignore the naysayer , this be a great hotel if you be travel on a budget .<ssssss>the best part about the hotel be the cleanliness , the quiet , the comfortable bed and the beautiful lobby .<ssssss>just spend three day at the new otanus kaimana and i could not be more pleased with what i get for the price .<ssssss>i would say the location be secluded and elegant : you be about two or three block from the main strip of waikiki but far enough that you can get away and have a quiet night 's rest -- the main strip can get a little flashy and common after a while .<ssssss>the open , airy lobby extend right through to the back where you can see the beach and the restaurant .<ssssss>the beach here be much less crowded than the one on the main strip .<ssssss>the standard room be pretty small but this be not a problem for I .<ssssss>my room be super clean and i be greet with complimentary pineapple in the fridge .<ssssss>i have spotless , heavy , white sheet on a thick mattress with two wonderful pillow .<ssssss>bed and pillow be so comfortable that my travel companion and i do not wake up until noon the next day .<ssssss>when i do wake up , i open my terrace door and all you could hear be the wind , the rustling of the tree and water -- very quiet .<ssssss>one thing i do find peculiar be the louvered bathroom door , which leave little privacy as you can hear through the door .<ssssss>towel be thick and clean , bathroom product be all by neutrogena .<ssssss>they do have internet access and other amenity available if need .<ssssss>staff be polite , i will defnitely stay here again .<ssssss>

4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		very nice hotel , great staff , right on the beach i will begin by say that i be travel on gov ' t business , so not only be i not pay , but i also get a very good deal on the room .<ssssss>i pay a little extra out of pocket for a pool/ocean view , which i must say be definitely worth it .<ssssss>instead of look out over a congested and unremarkable street , we look out at the ocean .<ssssss>great sight to wake up to .<ssssss>if i be to pay full price -lrb- ~ $ 250 -rrb- , i think i would be satisfied , although there be certainly other smaller hotel that would be cheaper and nice -lrb- we pass the consulado and the convento hotel , and both look great -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a couple of small problem .<ssssss>mainly , the balcony be have some renovation do , so we could not use it for a day or so .<ssssss>the staff give we a food credit , and a bottle of wine , so we be happy .<ssssss>the staff here be extremely friendly and helpful .<ssssss>they know they be work in a classy resort , and they treat they guest like guest .<ssssss>probably the best part of the hotel be the pool/beach area .<ssssss>two nice pool -lrb- though kinda shallow -rrb- , a hot tub , and a gorgeous beach with chair and umbrella .<ssssss>the ocean be a bit rough , but we swim every day .<ssssss>come from the northeast , it be no rougher than i be use to , and much warmer .<ssssss>overall , san juan be ok .<ssssss>after a couple of day , you feel like you have see most of what it have .<ssssss>i highly recommend get out of the city .<ssssss>go to some smaller town or beach , and check out the rainforest .<ssssss>bring plenty of water and snack , and hike up as far as you can .<ssssss>truly memorable .<ssssss>
3 5 3 -1 4 -1 3 -1		great value there be no doubt that for a great value in the union square area , you can not really go wrong with this hotel .<ssssss>that be say - the other review for this hotel seem a little overdo .<ssssss>sure , this be a nice little place , but it be not all that nice , and we be just a touch let down after read all these reviews.the public space in the hotel be pretty dark and a little worn on the edge , and you can tell that it be a old buildling .<ssssss>athough it be be redone , the dark lobby/bar area look like it be once a hip and cool hangout that be a little past its prime .<ssssss>still , it be a nice enough place to get a drink and sit.our room be clean and comfortable , and have some of the kitschy touch that we look for out of the joie de vivre and kimpton hotel chain .<ssssss>for whatever reason , the room have a slight bizarre odor to it - almost like it be once a smoker 's room that be never aerated fully .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable , and the homey bathroom look like it could have be in someone 's house rather than a hotel .<ssssss>overall , the fixture in the room be nothing special and for some reason , we be expect a little bit ... newer ?<ssssss>nicer ?<ssssss>but give the price of we room , we have no right to expect more .<ssssss>this be a great value , and while i would probably try another hotel if i be in the area again , i do recommend it for anyone look for a union square room under $ 150 per night .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 4 3 -1		hotel apartment for 4 we book the hotel apt for 4 as we be travel with 2 child age 11 and 8 .<ssssss>the hotel itself be next to the amstel canal , and the apt be just down the street down a side alley .<ssssss>the location couldnt be beat , and we have a fantastic time .<ssssss>however , i would definately not recommend the apt for 4 people .<ssssss>there be one small live room with 2 arm chair and a table with 2 chair .<ssssss>the bedroom have two single bed push together , and a seperate single bed push in the corner .<ssssss>there be also a tiny camp bed leave in the middle of the sit room to accomodate we youngest !<ssssss>as he be to afraid to sleep in a room on he own , we have all 4 bed cram into the one bedroom and all have to clamber across each other during the night for the inevitable toilet trips!the apt be fine for 3 people , 3 if you dont mind share a bedroom .<ssssss>we have stay in better and worse place , and basically just see we room as a place to crash , however if you have highter expectation , dont rent the apt !<ssssss>

4 4 4 5 4 2 2 4		great location , good for a extended stay stay here for five week in nov-dec 2007 .<ssssss>hotel location be excellent ; round the corner from broadway , less than ten min ' walk from macy 's , two minute from bryant park , five min from fifth avenue , and about ten min ' walk from the port authority -lrb- good for those who want to take a day trip to woodbury common shopping mall - highly recommend ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>hail a taxi from outside the hotel be not difficult and there be a subway station right beside it .<ssssss>my room on the 35th floor be quiet and have a view north up 6th avenue and over bryant park .<ssssss>it have the most comfortable bed i have ever sleep in - no exaggeration .<ssssss>the bathroom be small but very clean and nicely appoint ; shower be excellent and there be also a bath .<ssssss>the room have a safe , a iron board and a proper iron .<ssssss>there be a laundry in the basement which cost a dollar per wash and per dry - wash powder 's available free from the front desk .<ssssss>the dry cleaning service be good - same day delivery and the price be not bad .<ssssss>broadband internet access be available by wireless but could be a bit slow .<ssssss>my only issue with the room would be that it be very stuffy ; there be no way to open the window further than a few centimetre , so get fresh air in be a bit difficult .<ssssss>there be a kitchenette with a huge fridge and a dishwasher ; these be useful but i could have do with a hob or ring for saucepan - i have not be make aware that this be available on request .<ssssss>there be a 24-hour deli on the corner of the block next to the hotel .<ssssss>you can also get hot snack at the hotel bar on the second floor ; it be tiny but nice and have a pool table .<ssssss>there be a hospitality hour in the evening from mon-thur , where snack , soup , salad and so on be serve to guest .<ssssss>breakfast be really rather good - selection of hot food like sausage , bacon , potato , french toast , waffle , pancake , oatmeal and so on -lrb- skip the egg as they be nasty ! -rrb-<ssssss>, as well as pastry , bread , cheese and fruit .<ssssss>i would advise get down to breakast as early as you can as it get a bit hectic after 8.30 , particularly on weekend .<ssssss>as other reviewer have point out , the single biggest problem the hotel have be its elevator system .<ssssss>get a lift in either direction between 8.30 and 10.30 be very difficult - i wait up to ten minute on occasion .<ssssss>it appear that some of the lift be not even in service as it seem to be the same two that be always in use at breakfast time.front desk service on arrival and during the stay be fine ; however on departure i encounter some problem .<ssssss>there be absolutely no flexibility as regard check-out time ; i request checkout of 2pm but be tell i have to be out by 11.30 at the latest or else i would have to pay for another half-day .<ssssss>this despite the fact that we have pay for thirty night already !<ssssss>also , the manners of the male concierge leave a lot to be desire ; quite at odds with any other hotel concierge i have deal with .<ssssss>the doormen/porters be pleasant and polite .<ssssss>all in all it be a nice stay - if the residence inn iron out those few wrinkle in its service i have no doubt it will get more five-star rating from those on prolonged stay .<ssssss>

3 3 3 4 4 4 2 2		beautiful ... but ... my husband and i just return from a very relaxing and beautiful holiday in punta cana .<ssssss>this be the first time we have do all inclusive and have mix feeling on if we would go all inclusive again .<ssssss>i will briefly list some of the pro 's and con 's of we trip.pro 's : the resort be beautiful - the grounds and building be well keep , the pool be lovely and well maintain , the restaurant be clean , and the beach be amazing .<ssssss>the weather be perfect - in the 80 's everyday with very little rain and the ocean and pool water be just right .<ssssss>the resort be huge but the size of the resort do not bother we at all .<ssssss>we enjoy walk around and be alway able to hop on the train if we need to get some where fast.con 's : one of we biggest complaint be the staff - the vast majority of the staff we encounter seem less than enthused to be work at the resort .<ssssss>we tip for nearly everything at the beginning of we trip , but find that we get the same service whether or not we tip .<ssssss>overall the food be good , but not amazing .<ssssss>by the end of we trip we eat more out obligation -lrb- since we have already pay for it -rrb- rather than feel hungry and craving the food .<ssssss>i always manage to find plenty to fill up on , but my husband who be pickier be sick of the food about half-way through we trip .<ssssss>a few time i see fly crawl on the food , which be understandable , but also pretty gross .<ssssss>my husband , who rarely get sick be also sick for a good day , and lay in bed the entire time feel pretty miserable - i be not sure if this be due to a food issue or a water issue , but either could have be a possibility .<ssssss>watch to make sure that you water bottle be seal .<ssssss>several time we be give water bottle that be already open and refuse to accept they , request seal bottle .<ssssss>also , be prepare to feel pretty isolate -lrb- and stupid -rrb- if the only language you speak be english - if you meet more than a few english speaking individual you be lucky.some tip : if you have child be very careful in the ocean , as the tide could easily pull a young child under very quickly .<ssssss>wear a watch - the only clock we find in the entire resort be in the lobby .<ssssss>all of the outlet be european , except for 3 behind the tv which be hard to reach .<ssssss>there be no alarm clock - but you can set the phone to be a wake-up call .<ssssss>be aware that phone call to the we be very expensive .<ssssss>the phone in we room do not accept call card , so call home on christmas day to talk to both of we family use a credit card .<ssssss>we talk less than 4 minute total .<ssssss>when we arrive home , we credit card bill be $ 84.00 !<ssssss>we be dispute this right now , but not sure how it will turn out.overall we have a wonderful vacation and do not regret come to this resort or to punta cana .<ssssss>since this be we first big trip we do not really know what to expect , so we just think it be great to be out of the snow .<ssssss>however , after talk with other people at the resort , we consistently hear that this be the worst all-inclusive they have ever be to - which make we question whether or not we would recommend this resort to other .<ssssss>i doubt we will return to punta cana because there be many other place we would like to see , however i will always look back on this trip with fond memory .<ssssss>base on we experience i would recommend this resort , however , i would also thoroughly check out other option .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 1 2 -1 -1		do not care for the room but great location .<ssssss>we get a great rate at the last minute through hotels.com .<ssssss>this hotel look great from the outside but the room be very small and need a lot of work .<ssssss>the window sill have mildew on it , the curtain be dirty , the towel be very thin and wrinkled and the room just do not seem very clean .<ssssss>we be promise free valet parking on the website but when we check in we be tell the parking lot be full but that there be a pay-to-park lot on the corner ... which turn out to be cheaper than most hotel parking lot -lrb- $ 15.00 / 24 hour -rrb- but it be out on the street .<ssssss>on the up side , the location of this hotel be great !<ssssss>it be within walk distance of many restaurant and the french quarter .<ssssss>
2 4 1 4 1 4 3 -1		if the location only matter ... if you want to stayi in waikiki and to be close to the beach , and near all the 5 for $ 20 t-shirt shop ... this place be for you .<ssssss>the lobby be nice and so be the staff , and that be where in end .<ssssss>the room be small , and wall and door poorly paint .<ssssss>they have try to brighten the area up with blue a yellow color , but fail .<ssssss>other than the fit sheet , the bedding appear dirty or soil and need to be replace .<ssssss>if the wind be blow , the window whistle ... i check the door to the lanai , and everything -lrb- believe I -rrb- .<ssssss>now , they do offer valet parking , which be convenient when you be tired and want to relax , but the enterance be oppose traffice , and can only fit at most three car at a time !<ssssss>very fustrating as it be right next to a bus stop.great place to stay if you be only look for a place to sleep , and be on a budget ... but if you be plane to relax in you room , and enjoy a slow paced atmosphere ... try again .<ssssss>

4 3 5 5 4 2 3 3		location , location , location two 30-something couple from new york/new jersey just return from a trip to boston -- and we spend two night at the millenium thanks to a great deal due to construction at the hotel .<ssssss>even with the construction and a less-than-appealing makeshift reception desk , the stay be quite nice .<ssssss>the room be fabulous , with a gorgeous bathroom and a wonderful -lrb- but small -rrb- porch face fanueil hall .<ssssss>we only true knock be that on friday and saturday there be a long-standing veggie market that set up right in front of the hotel and above where we room be situate .<ssssss>its hard to enjoy you porch overlook the city when you be greet with the stench of rot vegetable and fruit .<ssssss>not for the faint of smell !<ssssss>other thing to note -- if you do not valet , feel free to at least unload you bag on the side of the road .<ssssss>the valet fail to mention that to I when we come to ask where we should park .<ssssss>we do not want to valet and use the lot across the street .<ssssss>when we come by with we large suitcase , he remember that we could have at least unloaded .<ssssss>also , make sure to let the hotel know that you be park across the street .<ssssss>although the valet tell we to go there , they end up be concern that we could leave we car there overnight .<ssssss>they make a call and learn it would be ok , but i be suppose that they do not usually deal with non-valet drivers.over all , a great trip and a great location .<ssssss>if you can afford the nightly cost , it be a sure bet .<ssssss>just bring you nose plug if you be stay the weekend !<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 5 5 4		nothing fancy we priceline a room at the hotel for about 75 $ a night , the go rate be about $ 260 a night !<ssssss>few nice thing about this hotel : great location - right on the river and next to the harrah 's , the staff be very friendly and helpful and there be alot of dine option in the hotel.the room be fine , the bed be very very comfortable and they have hbo available .<ssssss>they need to work on the carpet , in we room it be old look and stain .<ssssss>the wall be paper thin , we could hear the guy in the next room like he be in ours .<ssssss>i recommend to stay on a lower floor , the water pressure be terible on the higher floors.if you park at the hotel , expect to pay 29 $ per day for it !<ssssss>you can get a pass from the front dest so you wont have to wait in the exit line .<ssssss>wifus be 15 $ a day.all in all i cant complain , the room be fine and you cant beat a 75 $ a night rate , but i be not sure i would pay 260 $ for it .<ssssss>
4 5 3 4 5 3 4 5		great !<ssssss>i will post this review under both the ifa villa and ifa village as they be part of the same resort complex.overall this resort be above average and i would rate it a four out of five.my girlfreind and i -lrb- both 27 -rrb- arrive on jan 29 and stay until feb 5 , 2007 .<ssssss>facility : upon arrival they put we in the villa section , room 1089 , i ask they if they could move we closer to the beach and they say they would have a room in the 4000 block on the 31st .<ssssss>the villa section be quite a way away from the beach .<ssssss>the higher you room number in the 1000 block the further away you be .<ssssss>overall my room in the villa section be a little run down compare to the room i be give later in the 4000 block .<ssssss>i the worst problem be the shower -lrb- no tub -rrb- be very low flow and take a long time for the water to turn hot .<ssssss>also the refrigerator do not seem to cool very well even on high .<ssssss>the tv have no remote and the front door do not seem very secure .<ssssss>i would recommend everyone to rent a safe -lrb- $ 3 dollar a day -rrb- the villa overall wuold be good for someone who would prefere a quiet location pool site rather then a crowded beach .<ssssss>or the foot traffic of the other more central pools.the main stage , 3 al cart restaurant , a pool bar and captain lounge be all located in the villa section .<ssssss>the 2 buffet restaurant be located in the other part of the complex so they be bit of a walk to get to.on the january 31 we move to we room in the 4000 block in the ocean village section -lrb- 4036 -rrb- .<ssssss>the room overall be in much better shape the we other room in the villa the biigest improvement be the flow of the shower .<ssssss>the tv have a remote and as we be on the third flow we have a balcony .<ssssss>we be now only a short walk from the beach.the beach be great but make sure you wake up early and put a towel on a chair .<ssssss>many day we sleep in and could not find a empty chair and have to go over the barcelo section of beach.find the stage and stay away from it if you prefer quite as they like to blast the music.i find the grounds be very well keep and securefoodoverall the food be very good .<ssssss>you could aways get something to eat from 7 be to 3am .<ssssss>the buffet offer a abundance of different food .<ssssss>they always have someone on the grill cooking something .<ssssss>my personal favorite be breakfast , the cook woould prepare a omelette for you from a assortment of ingredient for you selection .<ssssss>my only complaint would be that sometime the waiter or waitress would take too long to get my drink and i would be finish eating by the time it arrive .<ssssss>i only eat at the international a la carte restaurant so i can not comment on the other two .<ssssss>many day i would grab a slice of pizza from the snack bar beside the pool in the village section.the disco -lrb- afterhour at the beach bar -rrb- be somewhat of a disappointment as it be not very well attend .<ssssss>but you can go there to grab a bite to eat up until 3am .<ssssss>staff and entertainmentoverall the staff be very freindly .<ssssss>i never have any problem get a drink .<ssssss>sometime i would go up to the bar and be ask what i want by three different bartender while the fourth be alreadty prepare my order .<ssssss>if you be sit at a table the waitress can take some time come around so i would have to go to the bar to get another drink .<ssssss>-lrb- no big deal -rrb- the animation team -lrb- entertainment -rrb- be very good and they try to keep you entertain .<ssssss>atmospherethe week i be there the resort be mostly attend by couple and european tourist -lrb- mostly french -rrb- .<ssssss>although i do see many different combination , group of woman , group of man , some family etc i would definitely go back again .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 3 5		good central hotel stay here for 4 night after cruise on star virgo , nice room , very good buffet breakfast , good pool and gym which we 2 16 yr old boy enjoy , nice central location for sightseeing , walk distance to many shopping centre eatry , staff always courteous but not what i would call family orientate , more design for business people but i think this be true of many hotel in singapore .<ssssss>
2 1 1 5 2 2 3 -1		another old hilton old , old , old.only stay there if you have to .<ssssss>be in the airport itself be easy and convient to get to.the food at the restaurant be quite good though .<ssssss>
4 4 2 5 5 4 4 -1		good just get back from barcelona and have a lovely stay .<ssssss>the hotel be quite trendy and the staff be lovely , however be very dissappointed with the fact that i search for a hotel on the internet that advertise a double room , and with add caution enter the request for a double room on the special request line ... still receive a twin room with a apology ... the basic double bed be a simple basic request that could not be provide ...<ssssss>
4 3 4 3 5 5 5 4		great character hotel we do not know too much about this place before book , but be delight when we stay there .<ssssss>it be stylish , charming and quirky , and even the lower grade room we have book turn out to be spacious and well equip .<ssssss>activity bustle in the lobby which also serve as the breakfast area .<ssssss>take a window seat and soak up the atmosphere with a very generous continental breakfast .<ssssss>manager larry could not have be more helpful .<ssssss>he provide we with info and map for get about and take the trouble to walk we part way to a restaurant that he recommend close by - one among a number of very under-statedly fashionable bistro and bar in this area.we will definately return to the blue moon .<ssssss>with the dollar/pound exchange rate it be not a cheap option for brit at the moment. , but on leave we be promise a great discount on we next trip there.mark juliette<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 5 5 5 3		great architecture and design , very professional staff swissotel hotel may be quite different from one place to another .<ssssss>we once experience the amsterdam one and have a very bad opinion of the chain -lrb- waken up by mystake quite early in the morning to get we check out quickly -rrb- .<ssssss>the berlin experience be way much better and start with a tour of the premise with a reception clerk wich be quite unusual .<ssssss>we be there for new year ' eve and have a very good room service diner on the 31st !<ssssss>when we arrive , we also have lunch at the restaurant wich be affordable -lrb- more expensive for diner -rrb- and enjoy a very fine cuisine .<ssssss>the room design convey a feeling of modern luxury and peacefulness .<ssssss>
5 5 4 4 4 3 2 5		absolutely fabulous !!<ssssss>spend a week at the majestic from 4/17 through 4/24 .<ssssss>here be the high and the low : airport be probably the worst run i have ever see - no organization , hundred of people swarm with no rope to form line , no idea of where to go or what to do .<ssssss>once through immigration find one of we bag be miss - try to communicate with a airport rep and fill out a form .<ssssss>miraculously the bag arrive at the hotel at the end of the day - sheer luck !<ssssss>we arrange transportation through expedia and have no problem there .<ssssss>the only annoying thing be that they could not tell I what time they would be pick we up at the hotel for the way back .<ssssss>i be force to go meet the rep at the hotel 3 time before they could give I that info.arrived at the hotel around 1:30 - the 2 room be not ready so we go for lunch at the buffet .<ssssss>finally get the room around 3:30 and they be next to each other but not pool view .<ssssss>also , one of the room have a terrible musty odor .<ssssss>i go to the front desk to try and switch room but they say the hotel be full .<ssssss>they promise to send someone right away to wash the room and try to eliminate the odor .<ssssss>well after call three more time no one ever show up so we just give up .<ssssss>eventually as the weather dry up the smell go away .<ssssss>the room be big and comfortable with awesome air conditioning .<ssssss>the shower be huge but the toilet area be a little small .<ssssss>there be a few too many mosquito for my taste but that be to be expect in the tropics - just a few bite on the kid , or so i think ... next day my 8 year old wake up with he eye completely swollen shut !<ssssss>we take he to the 24 hour medical clinic on site .<ssssss>the woman doctor there be very kind and helpful and give he a shot of something that bring the swell down after 24 hour .<ssssss>a little unnerving but the response be comforting.the food : all the food be better than i expect .<ssssss>i be not a fan of buffet but how else could they feed all these people economically ?<ssssss>the breakfast be unbelievable - fresh juice , egg , omelett , pancake , waffle , bread , roll , crepe , yogurt , fruit shake , etc. but the best thing be the freshly make churro - nothing like the mushy one you get in the we !<ssssss>i eat at least 4 every morning .<ssssss>and the coffee ?<ssssss>best i have ever have .<ssssss>the lunch be a little limited - 2 buffet - one on the beach and the breakfast one .<ssssss>dinner be a choice of the breakfast buffet where they have italian , or the other sit down restaurant - mexican , steakhouse , seafood , japanese and gourmet where only 12 and up can go .<ssssss>all be pretty good but the menu be small and not child friendly .<ssssss>initially my 8 and 10 year old do not eat anything because there be no chicken tender or mac and cheese .<ssssss>but guess what ?<ssssss>since they be hungry they try new thing and now they both like steak !<ssssss>pasta be only available at the main buffet for dinner .<ssssss>the dessert be also fantastic - a different variety every night .<ssssss>the chocolate cake be the best and they always have a ice cream bar - you must try the coconut ice cream - it be so delicious !<ssssss>believe I , we do not go hungry .<ssssss>my daughter do get diarrhea from the 3rd day until we get home but the rest of be be ok .<ssssss>i try to not drink too many of the tasty frozen drink just in case.now the reason i rate this a 5 : the beach and the pool .<ssssss>i have be on many vacation and these be by far the very best i have ever see .<ssssss>the pool be so big that it never seem crowded and it be clean all the time .<ssssss>the temperature be perfect and the ledge in the water be ingenious for sunbathe .<ssssss>i do not want to leave .<ssssss>since there be so much grass and vegetation around the pool you do not feel like you be in a hotel - it feel like paradise .<ssssss>the beach be also beautiful - the softest sand i have ever feel .<ssssss>the water be clear and blue although not as calm as i would have like .<ssssss>and i have to say that this be the only beach in the caribbean that i have be to that do not have the annoying local try to sell you hair braid and jewelry - what a wonderful change!the kid club be a little dull but my kid only go to hang out with other kid so it be ok for they for a couple of day .<ssssss>at the beach and pool every day they bring a different animal for people to pose with and then purchase the picture for $ 10 a piece .<ssssss>a little pricey but i be glad i buy all 8 of they - a python , 2 different monkey , 2 macaw and a iguana - pretty cool for the kids.we go to a couple of the show but they be a little cheesy .<ssssss>i try the casino and that be fun - win a little money too .<ssssss>the nightlife be not fantastic but we be happy to relax in the room and read or watch tv .<ssssss>want to get up early anyway to enjoy the outdoors.all in all this be a great vacation if you can get past the little annoying thing .<ssssss>i have be on cruise and to other caribbean island but for a family of 5 this be the best value around .<ssssss>if you want to relax and sit by the pool and the beach this be the place for you !<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		great hotel - management problem while stay two night in june , we fould the hotel to be very comfortable .<ssssss>we be upgrade to a suite room on the 11th floor since we be ambassador member of they priority club .<ssssss>the room have a view of only part of union square and a glimpse of the bay bridge.they send a small cake to we room to celebrate ourwedding anniversary .<ssssss>it be a nice touch and unexpected.two problem : 1 -rrb- we room be right next to the elevator and the motor noise could be hear all night -lrb- right next to the bed -rrb- .<ssssss>2 -rrb- when book the room we be tell that the parking and the breakfast be include in the package .<ssssss>at check-in we be tell that only breakfast be include the second day .<ssssss>we tell they that the reservation agent have specifically tell we that parking be include -lrb- along with breakfast -rrb- in the package .<ssssss>but we finally give in and register with the understanding that only breakfast be include for the second day .<ssssss>when it come time to check out , they have include both the parking and the breakfast on my bill .<ssssss>when i speak to the manager at the desk -lrb- night manager -rrb- he inform I that this be not the first time a guest have be mislead during the process of registration and he insist that i pay for parking and breakfast -lrb- parking be $ 51.30 per day and breakfast buffet be around $ 45 for two -rrb- .<ssssss>after 15 minute of explain to the manager that this be he hotel 's fault and not mine , he begrudgingly take the breakfast off the bill.my advice would be if you be book a package at this hotel , get all the detail in write before you go !<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 5 3 3 4		great value .<ssssss>.<ssssss>hotel montreal be great value .<ssssss>we pay 65 euro a night for a double room and breakfast .<ssssss>we room be really nice , it look like it have be recently renovate and be well sound proof against what would have be a awfully noisey street .<ssssss>so top point for comfort and cleanliness but the staff and area let it down a little .<ssssss>.<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 4 -1 2 -1		just ok i will start off by say that there be no major problem with the hotel or we stay .<ssssss>have say that , i would like to point out to people who wish to stay there in the future some issue they might run in to.when we first arrive , the first thing i notice be the horrible neighborhood .<ssssss>very dirty -lrb- even for san francisco standard -rrb- and a lot of homeless .<ssssss>as i be unpack my bag from the car , i be overwhelm by the smell of what could only be describe as a green leafy substance be smoke no more than 10 foot from I .<ssssss>i could not get away from it and could not find the source .<ssssss>i mention to my fiance my goodness , someone be smoke marij ... !<ssssss>the doorman hear I and say welcome to the city !<ssssss>which i find very offensive and rude .<ssssss>after be move to a different room -lrb- at we request -rrb- we finally settle in .<ssssss>we room be very small -lrb- expect -rrb- and the bathroom be even smaller than expect ... but oh well , it be clean and neat .<ssssss>there be no view however .<ssssss>it be a pet friendly hotel and they be very accomidate to we dog which be expect due to the fact they advertize themselves pet friendly.overall the hotel be fine , it be just not a place i would go out of my way to stay in if i have a choice .<ssssss>we be sort of limited because of we dog .<ssssss>last tip : make sure you do you research before you choose the serrano , you might find something better ... or maybe not .<ssssss>
3 2 5 3 5 5 5 4		comfortable stay , but isolate and problem with min-bar charge this hotel be generally nice .<ssssss>on the plus side 1 .<ssssss>the bedding be extremely comfortable .<ssssss>you will sleep well .2 .<ssssss>the hotel seem to be well make and it be quiet .3 .<ssssss>there be a nice pool .<ssssss>it be roomy and have little sprinkler that squirt out from one side .4 .<ssssss>there be lot of free parking .<ssssss>but , there be some negative :1 .<ssssss>the hotel be isolate .<ssssss>you can not walk anywhere .<ssssss>if you try , you will probably get run over .<ssssss>the hotel do operate a shuttle , but it be on a first come , first serve basis .<ssssss>so , you can not reserve it for use .<ssssss>it be best to have a rental car if you stay at this place .<ssssss>there be plenty of restaurant a few exit down .2 .<ssssss>there be a expensive restaurant on the premise and also a bar with bar food .<ssssss>the bar food be for the most part not very healthy .2 .<ssssss>they spray a wierd fragrance in the lobby , i guess to create some ambience .<ssssss>it smell like a really strong , synthetic floral perfume .<ssssss>yuck .3 .<ssssss>the hotel erroneously charge I for the mini-bar -lrb- $ 50.00 . -rrb-<ssssss>i do not use the mini bar , so i be guess that a hotel employee take stuff from the mini-bar and charge it to my room .<ssssss>i call the hotel and they apologize and say that i would be refund .<ssssss>i do appreciate the quick response , but hey ... i be not use to have false charge on my credit card .<ssssss>i be glad that i checked.all in all , it be not a bad stay .<ssssss>however , for the reason above i would probably seek out another hotel next time in dallas .<ssssss>if you have business in the area , it be probably a decent choice .<ssssss>

2 2 1 4 2 1 1 3		didnt live up to the marriot brand .<ssssss>i just return from my stay in san juan puerto rico , at the courtyard marriot on isla verde .<ssssss>i have to say that i be disappoint with the service .<ssssss>the first night we arrive , we noticedthat the floor mat in the bathroom be wet and we could not figure out where the water come from .<ssssss>also , the bathroom be not very clean and be a little moldy .<ssssss>we then notice a watermark on the wall .<ssssss>whenwe call the frontdesk to tell they there be a leak , they say theywould get back to we .<ssssss>we hear nothing back .<ssssss>the next morning we call again .<ssssss>the front desk say they would look into get we another room .<ssssss>they say they would call we back .<ssssss>we go out for about 6-7 hour and hear nothing from they .<ssssss>when we come back to theroom , the whole bathroom floor be wet and water be leak from theceil .<ssssss>we call the front desk for a third time and finally they relocate we and tell we a pipe be break .<ssssss>the new room be better but i be very upset that they take so long to accomodate we .<ssssss>the dinner buffet downstairs be about 23 dollar and the food be reallynot impressive and a little dry .<ssssss>but the ice cream bar be excellent and the mojito at the dar be great !<ssssss>i enjoy the live band downstairs .<ssssss>the service , however , spoil my stay .<ssssss>in addition , the concierge seem to have no idea how to direct we to basic place in san juan .<ssssss>i would not stay at this hotel again .<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		a little disappointing we just return from a week at natura park , punta cana .<ssssss>the grounds be beautiful and the room be spacious and clean .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly but on the slow side .<ssssss>service at the buffet be disappointing and we have to go search for coffee , cutlery and mugs.if you want a chair at the beach you must have to get up at 4:00 .<ssssss>we be on the beach by 7:00 and most of the chair already have towel on they even though the hotel 's brochure say you can not hold the chair for more than 15 minute .<ssssss>this be disappointing and most chair be leave vacant all day which i thought be very unfair .<ssssss>the weather be extremely windy and the beach be average .<ssssss>i actually prefer puerta plata and think the water be cleaner , calmer and without boat traffic everywhere .<ssssss>the beach be cover with weed most day as the crew must not have be able to keep up due to the windy conditions.the best feature i find with this resort be the friendly staff but the food be only average .<ssssss>my friend get sun poisoning and she suffer with swell and a itchy rash all week .<ssssss>my husband love the deep sea fishing and catch quite a few fish .<ssssss>sail fish and maui maui i believe.i would not recommend any day excursion because they be way too overcrowded and would have rather stay at the beach on the resort.i would give this trip a overall rating of 7/10 due to the beach and swimming condition .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 3 1 1 1		a waste of money ... we stay here during we european trip some month ago and be bitterly disappointed .<ssssss>the staff be somewhat standoffish and service be not good .<ssssss>we have to carry we own bag from the kerbside to the hotel - seven heavy suitcase .<ssssss>on other occasion they be less than helpful.the hotel have be cheaply renovate and the owner apparently regard the style as contemporary chic .<ssssss>as a result , the price of the room -lrb- and everything else -rrb- be outrageous .<ssssss>we be awake at 7:30 be every morning by the construction crew work on a nearby structure .<ssssss>some rudimentary double glazing and/or soundproofing of room during refurbish could have prevent that intrusion , but no such luck !<ssssss>the food be above average but the portion be small and we quickly tire of the same old cold cut and exotic fruit for breakfast .<ssssss>like everything else , the food be ridiculously overpriced.despite the fact that we do not make any sort of mess , it take the cleaning crew three trip to service we room and the do not disturb sign be routinely ignored.we will never stay at the dylan again !<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 3 5 5 3		great place to relax and enjoy the resort my wife and i stay at the el conquistador for we 1 year anniversary oct 1st-6th .<ssssss>we read all the review prior to take we trip so alot of it be expect .<ssssss>i think in general , all the review be accurate.weather - near the end of hurricane season , we be somewhat worried about the weather , but it be 85-90 each day partly cloudy .<ssssss>when the sun be out , it be hot , there be a breeze by the pool and also on the island.food - the food be expensive .<ssssss>$ 10-15 for a burger , $ 25-45 for a dinner entree .<ssssss>however , the food be good quality .<ssssss>actually the breakfast at the caribe cafe be price pretty well $ 6-9 for entree , and the coffee shop have bagel , muffin that we price ok .<ssssss>so you could start the day off with a good meal and a good price .<ssssss>we do not do the buffett at las brisas , as it be close -lrb- i think it be $ 20 a person anyhow -rrb- .<ssssss>we find the ballyhoo bar and grill at the marina to have the best lunch menu and moderate price .<ssssss>the burger , sandwich and quesadilla be all good .<ssssss>the main grill on palomino be close and the secondary grill be ok , but the price be higher .<ssssss>alot of people have say good thing about the pizza at the pool , but we do not think it be too good .<ssssss>dinner at otello -lrb- italian -rrb- be very good .<ssssss>dinner at blossom -lrb- chinese -rrb- be ok .<ssssss>i think if they just lower some of they price $ 5 - $ 10 , they would have no complaint .<ssssss>hotel - as with other at this time , we be in the la vista section , we originally have a garden view , but they give we a free upgrade to a ocean view , which overlook the main pool/ocean and with a nice balcony .<ssssss>the sunrise come up on this side .<ssssss>the room itself be in need of a upgrade .<ssssss>just older stuff , it would be a nice room with renovation .<ssssss>they be do major renovation to other part of the hotel -lrb- bristas wing -rrb- so i assume , they will upgrade this one once the other be do .<ssssss>renovation of room and a waterpark be say to be complete in 2006-2007 .<ssssss>they be also update they boat .<ssssss>in the offseason , it definately be a much more lay back hotel .<ssssss>it be like you have it to yourself , so it be quiet .<ssssss>some of the restaurant be close , since there be not that many people but there be still plenty of choice .<ssssss>we spend a day by the main pool and that be nice , as we be close to we hotel room , and also close to the pool bar and server .<ssssss>we also find the infinity pool in the casita , and that be a great view as well .<ssssss>i could see how these would be crowd in the main season .<ssssss>i think it be pretty easy to get around with the funicular -lrb- tram -rrb- to take you to the marina section and the boat to take you to palomino island .<ssssss>we enjoy the boat ride .<ssssss>we spend a couple day out at palomino island .<ssssss>it be definately pretty cool to have you own island .<ssssss>we take the first 9am ride out in the morning and along with a couple other people have the island to ourselves .<ssssss>there be plenty of towels/chairs/umbrellas to use on the island .<ssssss>it be set up pretty well .<ssssss>the water do have coral in it , so at time the bottom be rocky .<ssssss>we do find a nice patch further out that become smooth sand again .<ssssss>so try to go past the 1st section .<ssssss>if it be hot and you want a breeze , go right when get off the boat -lrb- best beach also -rrb- .<ssssss>but if the wind pick up and it get 's cloudy , stay on the left side or close to the dock -lrb- less wind -rrb- .<ssssss>spa - my wife love the spa .<ssssss>she say it be very worth the money .<ssssss>she get a 60 minute massage .<ssssss>she highly recommend the service there .<ssssss>she say the massage be great and the setting be perfect.golf - i guess on tues/thurs during the offseason they have discount rate on golf after 1pm .<ssssss>so it be $ 70 to play 18 .<ssssss>-lrb- they be in the process of build a 9 hole course -rrb- .<ssssss>the golf course be really nice and all the tee box be positioned high , so alot of you drive will go quite a bit further 100-150 yard .<ssssss>it be pretty interesting .<ssssss>the course be very well take care of .<ssssss>the fairway be pretty straight and open , so it be a easy course to play .<ssssss>lot of iguana roam the fairway which go along with the view of the mountain .<ssssss>all in all , this hotel be a good choice .<ssssss>i think once the renovation be complete , it may be a great hotel .<ssssss>in the offseason it be a good choice for relaxing and water sport .<ssssss>i would not recommend it for night life if that be what you look for or for socialize , as there be not many people there -lrb- i be speak about the offseason -rrb- .<ssssss>but for a getaway of sun , surf , pool , golf , spa and food , it be a good choice .<ssssss>also , the staff at the hotel be very friendly and attentive .<ssssss>** p , if you connect in ny at jfk for jetblue , the san juan connection be in terminal 4 , you have to take a shuttle train which can take time **<ssssss>

3 1 1 -1 5 -1 5 -1		not great you expect certain thing from a hotel that bill itself as 4/5 star .<ssssss>a decent size room , a window that look out at something other than a airshaft , a mattress that be at least a few step above something you sleep on in college , nice soft linen ... the list go on .<ssssss>while the staff be top notch , attentive and try very hard to make thing right , the clari be not luxurious by any stretch of the imagination and be overprice for what it be .<ssssss>boutique hotel be know for small room and minimalist decor so if this be you preference , by all means stay there .<ssssss>the lobby be a bit depressing and much smaller than it look in picture .<ssssss>the bar be tiny .<ssssss>the location , however , be excellent .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 1 1 4 3		save you money - find another resort - we just return from 6 day on the resort .<ssssss>while it be nice to be on vacation , the resort be not worth the money .<ssssss>at $ 500 per night , there be many place that you can stay that be cleaner , newer and more high end.a couple of point : - we be lucky to be in the new renovate room .<ssssss>the room be clean and refreshing .<ssssss>the bed be great and the bathroom be very large .<ssssss>a cheap shower curtain and a rip couch be the only issue with the room .<ssssss>it be in appropiate that they charge a 25 % hotel tax for the renoviate room .<ssssss>they do not advise it at check in .<ssssss>- the food be terrible and overpiced .<ssssss>every place you eat , the menu be the same .<ssssss>- fine dinning - the resort have 3 high end restuarant for dinner only .<ssssss>the food be good , but everthe be 2x what should have be charge .<ssssss>- grounds - the resort be beautifully located on the cliff , but without easy acess to a beach , make for a major disappointment .<ssssss>the private island be not that great .<ssssss>you have to wait for a ferry , which only run on the 1/2 hour and the ride be about 15 minute .<ssssss>after all the dealing , it be not worth it .<ssssss>because of the inconvience , we only go to the island one time and spend all the time at the pool .<ssssss>the island be not that great .<ssssss>- the tram - you have to take a tram down to the lower part of the resort .<ssssss>most of the time that we be there , one of the tram be break .<ssssss>everyday we spend about 30 minute wait in line for the tram .<ssssss>- activity - the pricing to snorkel , fish , sail , etc. be so over inflated , that we do not spend the money .<ssssss>- the golden door spa - we really enjoy the treatment and the staff be fantastic .<ssssss>the spa seem to not fit in with the resort since it be so much nicer than any spot on the resort .<ssssss>the only negative about the spa be that it be so expensive .<ssssss>but once you be at this resort , you be looknig for some relief from you overpriced reality .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		beautiful resort .<ssssss>.<ssssss>some positive , seme negative we book the grand palladium bavaro for 5 night january 29 - february 3 -lrb- 5 night -rrb- .<ssssss>we 2 friend come one day ealier and leave one day earlier .<ssssss>i will not go into lot of detail on the resort , as much have be write here .<ssssss>but here be we opinion on thing that leave a impression on we : grounds - beautiful , perfectly minicured lawn , flower , tree .<ssssss>just beautiful .<ssssss>a great location.beach - very clean - too rough for swim the first few day , but it calm down the last 2 dayspool - awesome .<ssssss>never too crowded , and water be perfect .<ssssss>however , like in all of these type of resort , if you show up at the pool after 9:00 am , you will not get a chair .<ssssss>this be because many , many people go out early in the morning and lay they towel and book on the chair .<ssssss>i be out at 8:15 be one morning , and there be 2 people sit at the pool , but not a single available chair .<ssssss>so what do we do ?<ssssss>sad to say , we join the alarm at 6:00 be people and reserve we chair in the early morning -lrb- dark -rrb- .<ssssss>although the resort say no saving chair , everyone who be sit at chair at the pool have stake they out in the morning.internet cafÃ© - personnel be polite and helpful .<ssssss>no wireless internet , and no other way to access besides the internet cafÃ© .<ssssss>open 9:30 am-9 :30 pm .<ssssss>$ 5 for half-hour , $ 8 for whole hour , and you can use the time in short increment , not all at once .<ssssss>evening at the computer be crowd , morning be not .<ssssss>i use my own laptop in the internet cafÃ© , but i think that be only possible because one of the pc be down and there wan a extra cable free .<ssssss>i suggest if you really want to use you laptop , perhaps you should bring a long ethernet cable and then you can plug it into the router and then sit off to the side.housekeeping - the room be always clean spotlessly .<ssssss>they forget to leave we towel one day , but overall , no complaint .<ssssss>no english.fridge in the room - the resort say it would be restock every other day .<ssssss>no one ever restock ours .<ssssss>we call every day , they say they would send someone up , no one ever came.jacuzzi in the room - first day , do not work .<ssssss>call about it , they say they would send someone .<ssssss>no one come .<ssssss>3 call over the next 12 hour , always tell use that someone would come , no one ever come .<ssssss>after the first night , we just ask for a room change .<ssssss>accomodate .<ssssss>move to room 7426 .<ssssss>when i tell the front desk the reason we want to move -lrb- jacuzzi break -rrb- , they do not have any concern for this problem .<ssssss>when i ask what they would do when the new guest in room 6120 complain that the jacuzzi do not work , they say they would probably move he too , if he ask .<ssssss>fix the jacuzzi , or even understand that the jacuzzi need to be fix , seem to be the least of they concerns.dive center on the property - not a padi shop .<ssssss>not sanction by any body , and now i know why .<ssssss>i think it be call dolin dive .<ssssss>totally incompetent staff .<ssssss>7 diver , one divemaster , $ 40 per dive .<ssssss>tank be not even fill , the dive have to be delay to fill tank .<ssssss>then , get underway be a experience with the tender boat fill with water from the wave and even more when the driver lose the plug for the boat .<ssssss>on the dive itself , there be a totally incompetent divemaster .<ssssss>he throw he bcd and tank over the side to put it on in the water , and it sink to the bottom because he forget to inflate the bcd .<ssssss>one of we have to dive down and get it for he .<ssssss>many of the regulator be leak , so people be run low on air so no safety stop at 5 meter .<ssssss>i feel sorry for the 2 guy on the trip who prepay for 10 dive each !<ssssss>this be a very dangerous situation for all but the most experienced diver.watersports - too windy most day to use sailboat .<ssssss>on the couple day they let they out , it be pretty churn up in the water .<ssssss>do not see any kayak be use .<ssssss>this be definitely not a good place if you be a watersport person.apple vacation service - the apple representative -lrb- mr. sosa -rrb- be one of the rudest people i have ever meet .<ssssss>he complain about he job , say it be low pay -lrb- he actually say if only i have the money sammy sosa have , i would not be work this job -rrb- .<ssssss>he tell we we shuttle to the airport need to be arrange for 5?1/2 hour prior to we schedule flight !<ssssss>-lrb- the airport be 35 minute from the property ! -rrb-<ssssss>when i discuss this with he , he first reply be there be no flight at the time you tell I .<ssssss>when i tell he he be incorrect , he reluctantly call the airline who tell he the flight be when i tell he -lrb- i could understand the jist of the conversation by the spanish he speak -rrb- .<ssssss>he then get off the phone and lie to I to my face and say my flight do not exist .<ssssss>i start to call he on this but he interrupt and say i have no more time for you , if you do not like it , take a taxi , my job be finish with you .<ssssss>any other deal with he would have be futile , so we just take a taxi -lrb- $ 25 -rrb- .<ssssss>it be unbelievable how a guy like this can keep he job .<ssssss>i will write a letter to apple vacation , but my guess be that mr. sosa will be unaffected and continue to disrespect he client .<ssssss>sad how someone like this can still be in a customer service capacity.exchange - the hotel offer a poor rate of 26 peso per 1 we $ , and will not buy back any peso you do not use .<ssssss>off site -lrb- walk along the beach to the right to the small village -rrb- , the rate be 34 peso per 1 we $ .<ssssss>phone - price be list as 37 peso per minute to usa if you dial 9-1-areacode-number .<ssssss>i make a few call , there be a slight delay on the line , but the bill be accurate , round up to the next minute .<ssssss>most of the call i make -lrb- need to keep in touch -rrb- be via webphone from my pc plug into the internet cafÃ© .<ssssss>local call be 10 peso per minute for the first 3 minute , then only 1 peso per minute after that .<ssssss>call to cell phone in the dr be 7 peso per minute.bill - you phone charge -lrb- and if you have lobster in the specialty restaurant -rrb- will be in peso .<ssssss>if you bill be large , you will be better off get peso at the exchange or atm in the village than get the poor exchange rate they will give you for pay with we $ all show at night in the amphetheatre be in spanish .<ssssss>we only say the magic show , it be ok and fun.they have a bar call the piano bar , but it have no piano !<ssssss>but it have better liquor and it also have champagne.some staff speak no english , some speak a little , a few speak conversational english .<ssssss>this be little problem for we , as my wife speak passable spanish and i like work on mine .<ssssss>we friend speak no spanish and struggle order thing or ask about things.clients - i be tell that 60 % of hotel guest be from usa .<ssssss>the next biggest group be , in order , germany , canada , spain france and spain.dining room - all water , wine and sode be bring by wait staff .<ssssss>sometimes service be ok , sometimes slow , sometimes they forget .<ssssss>keep ask and you will eventually get what you want to drink .<ssssss>the wine be not top notch , but acceptable .<ssssss>all the table be not set all the time , no big deal .<ssssss>one night , we have to wait at the door of the dining room because it be too crowded.we think the dining room near the lobby of grand paladium bavaro have the best variety , but we could be wrong.food - at the buffet , good variety , good quality .<ssssss>but in 5 day , it would have be nice to have breakfast or lunch or dinner someplace else .<ssssss>in the specialty restaurant -lrb- you be suppose to be able to go 2 time -rrb- , the only one available the entire time we be there be the dominican restaurant .<ssssss>the reason be that many people come here for 2 week and pre-reserve all the available time .<ssssss>for those who come for 5 day , there be no time leave .<ssssss>and i mean nothing .<ssssss>anywhere .<ssssss>and nothing you can do about it until fiesta change they system .<ssssss>if you come for a week or less , do not expect to eat any meal in the specialy restaurant except the dominican one -lrb- which i though be very good -rrb- .<ssssss>bar - pool bar do not have top shelf liquor .<ssssss>only the lobby bar have the good stuff .<ssssss>we drink beer mostly , so no big deal for us.music at the pool - always the same 5 spanish-language song .<ssssss>good song , but get a little old after 5 day .<ssssss>i will bet if i have give they a cd , they would have play it , but i do not bring any.tv in the room - very few usa network channel , but i think they have fox .<ssssss>i know they have cnn and a few movie channel .<ssssss>do not matter to we , hardly watch tv.activities .<ssssss>no daily schedule of activity give out , no pool volleyball or game , no dance lesson , etc. this be strictly a sit-by-the-pool-or-beach type of place .<ssssss>we would have like more to do.sports .<ssssss>tennis court look nice , no one ever use themsport bar .<ssssss>have the nhl package and a bunch of tv and will look for any game you want.casino - only walk through .<ssssss>blackjack table be a minimum of $ 5 or 100 peso , so if you want to play $ 3 blockjack , go to the village and use the atm to get peso , or exchange dollar for peso at one of the exchanges.although my report might seem negative , i think it be more of a reflection on what i view as the lack of customer service mentality at a all-inclusive resort in the dominican republic .<ssssss>we meet a couple from canada on we last night in the sport bar who be only stay here one night .<ssssss>they go on and on about how much better this resort be than the place they be at next door for 14 day !<ssssss>they tell we about bathtub that do not drain , bad room , bad food , line at bar , etc. so i guess it be all in you perspective .<ssssss>maybe all-inclusive be not for we .<ssssss>
3 3 4 4 5 3 2 -1		very good but !!!<ssssss>my wife three kid and i stay at this complex for 2 week .<ssssss>the hotel grounds be keep immaculate and there be no litter to be find anywhere .<ssssss>this include cigarette butt .<ssssss>all the pool be well look after and maintain .<ssssss>the complex be one of three so there be plenty of grounds and space with a train to get you from a-to-b .<ssssss>the room be very good as well with nice friendly room/cleaning staff .<ssssss>the beach , well this be the selling point for I , beautiful white powdery sand probably one of the best in the dominican .<ssssss>this be my 5th visit to the dr and i have stay all over the island .<ssssss>two problem though !<ssssss>a lot of the staff we find very miserable , it be as if they could not be bother , however on the other hand there be some very nice friendly staff .<ssssss>but overall we find 70 % of the staff in restaurant very moody indeed .<ssssss>it be as if they resent serve you with food and drink .<ssssss>the other and final problem be the food .<ssssss>a lot of the meat , chicken etc be either not cook or very much under cook .<ssssss>this could have cause a serious health hazard .<ssssss>we end up leave plateful of meat because it be just not cook through enough .<ssssss>in fact we feel embarrassed leave it .<ssssss>we do explain to several staff the reason why but this be never take seriously .<ssssss>i would certainly go back to bavaro but most probably try another hotel for the two point mention .<ssssss>
3 4 2 3 4 2 3 -1		a ok hotel we book a hotel on priceline and this be what we get .<ssssss>it be a nice hotel for the price we pay -lrb- less than $ 100.00 -rrb- but nothing great .<ssssss>the lobby be outstanding but the room be average .<ssssss>the carpet could be replace .<ssssss>the front desk clerk we interact with seem robotic and indifferent .<ssssss>i will say the food from room service be outstanding , although a bit pricey .<ssssss>i would stay here again at the rate we receive from priceline but would not pay full rate for this hotel .<ssssss>
3 2 3 3 4 2 2 4		not great in barcelona and spain standard if this hotel be in other city , i might find it very impressive as it be house in a old building .<ssssss>but after a journey of more than 14 day through out spain , i find this hotel deserve the grade ` average ' only .<ssssss>locationthe location be good but not superb .<ssssss>it be relatively close to a metro but not very close .<ssssss>we still have to walk more than five minute to the metro .<ssssss>five minute in spain autum sun be already very long and even worse when we finish shopping .<ssssss>roomwe book a suite at this hotel as a treat as it be the final leg before we transit back to madrid .<ssssss>it prove to be a waste of money .<ssssss>if you decide to stay at this hotel , my advice be go for the cheapest room category .<ssssss>save you money for other purpose or stay at a better hotel.serviceno warm welcome or sincere goodbye be offer .<ssssss>no smile face at the reception .<ssssss>do not expect five star or small family run hotel service.facilitiesthe internet service be alright .<ssssss>the indoor pool be the only merit of the hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 2 4 3 3		mediocre at best after stay at several w hotel , i decide to book a stay at the w san francisco for a vacation .<ssssss>my room which cost $ 500 / night be completely unremarkable , especially in a hotel chain that pride itself in excellence .<ssssss>the room be small , cramped , and in need of a complete update .<ssssss>the furnishings be old and heavily worn , the bathroom be small and dated , and not nearly as pristine as show in the picture .<ssssss>i ask to be move to a different room , and they happily move I , but it be just as bad .<ssssss>the bellman tell I that they be soon to start remodel the room , as they have be like that for over 8 year .<ssssss>the service be okay , but not remarkable .<ssssss>on the up side , the bed in the room be very comfortable , and the hotel lobby , bar and restaurant have a up-beat lively vibe .<ssssss>overall , the stay be a bit of a dissappointment , especially give my recent previous experience at starwood property .<ssssss>i would reccomend stay at the st regis , which be only a block away , where you be sure not be dissapoint .<ssssss>
1 -1 3 4 5 1 1 3		really disappointed - please do not make we mistake .<ssssss>stay elsewhere .<ssssss>we be well travel have stay in numerous hotel in numerous country around the world and have just return from barcelona after a 5 day trip .<ssssss>we choose the jazz after read tripadvisor review and have always be really impressed with the honesty of review here and all the previous hotel we have stay in as a result of these recommendation have be fantastic .<ssssss>i have never feel it necessary to write a review before because all of the other review have say exactly what i would have do .<ssssss>however , the jazz be different .<ssssss>very different .<ssssss>we stay here as it be cheap in comparison with other hotel and we decide that all we need be a roof over we head as we would spend most of the day sightseeing .<ssssss>however , we have forget how important level of service , basic amenity and manners be to we .<ssssss>prior to we arrival i email the hotel tell they we be on honeymoon and ask for general advice include how to get barcelona ticket .<ssssss>we receive no reply whatsoever .<ssssss>i assume it may have just be overlook .<ssssss>on we arrival , have be delay and have issue with we bagagge , i call down to ask if we could borrow a iron .<ssssss>i be tell that the hotel do not let guest use iron for ` security ` reason .<ssssss>i offer a Â£100 deposit but be still refuse .<ssssss>i then ask for they advice and be tell they would gladly iron we clothes for 5 euro each item !!!<ssssss>my wife and i then go to speak to the staff who we be totally uninterested in we request and literally just shrug they shoulder .<ssssss>i then ask how other guest iron they clothes as i suspect we be not the first to have this issue and i be tell to go and buy and iron and iron board !<ssssss>madness .<ssssss>fortunately , another couple -lrb- potentially the previous reviewer -rrb- lend we a travel iron for the night .<ssssss>-lrb- thank you so much :--rrb- -rrb- we finally buy a iron and have to iron all of we clothes on a table .<ssssss>we note a iron burn on the dress table indicate other have have the same problem.the rest of the stay be poor even though we really try to make the best of it .<ssssss>towel be not replace , mini bar poorly stock - and price ridiculous - bath gel/shampoo not replace -lrb- we have to leave note ask for more ! -rrb-<ssssss>and we double room be two twin bed push together .<ssssss>we have read in other review about noise from the metro .<ssssss>we be on the sixth floor and you hear it clearly !<ssssss>there be no two way about it .<ssssss>we stay in hotel in new york where soundproofing be excellent - the jazz be appalling .<ssssss>before we leave a friend suggest stay in a youth hostel and i laugh because we like the comfort of a hotel - but we genuinely feel that hotel jazz be little more than a clean , secure place to stay .<ssssss>it be overprice , poorly staff , and stay there totally spoilt we trip .<ssssss>that be the first time we would say that about any hotel and can usually see the positive in every place we stay .<ssssss>room look good but the amenity be basic .<ssssss>the lobby be really basic and i now know why the main photo i have see be only of the room itself.i often read review on here when people be disappoint with a hotel and think ' i bet they be a miserable couple ' or ' i bet they do not give it a chance ' .<ssssss>but we do try to enjoy the hotel .<ssssss>we be a average , hard work couple , who hope that by pay Â£700 for a hotel for 5 night we would have a good break .<ssssss>we be wrong .<ssssss>we have give the hotel a rating of one star so that the hotel staff read we review and make change to the hotel and other tripadvisor member also read it and hopefully learn from we mistake .<ssssss>please do not make the same mistake we do - just stay elsewhere .<ssssss>

4 3 4 5 5 5 4 3		nice but some rough edge this be a good and promising hotel , but some of the basic service be uneven or neglect .<ssssss>i expect more perfection from this property at these rate .<ssssss>that say , i would be happy to stay here again.i stay 6 night alone in a deluxe room .<ssssss>the room be spacious with a lovely view , and the furniture and appointment be all high quality and attractive .<ssssss>the bed be quite comfortable .<ssssss>i would have like another chair perhaps , and some artwork on a relatively blank wall would have be nice , but it be a very pleasant space .<ssssss>room service -lrb- breakfast -rrb- be excellent , and staff be very nice and accommodate when i encounter them.the rough edge : - i be delighted to see a coffeemaker in the room , with two dose of coffee .<ssssss>but after two day they have not notice that i be actually drink it , and i have to ask they to deliver more .<ssssss>minor , of course , unless you do not notice it until 6am !<ssssss>- there be no room service menu in the room and i have to call and request one .<ssssss>- i like to sleep in a coldish room and set the temperature to 60 or so -lrb- outside temp at night probably 40s -rrb- .<ssssss>in fact this be somewhat important because the bed have a top sheet and then a duvet , which tend to make I warm .<ssssss>i feel like the room temperature really never drop that much -lrb- the wall unit do not tell you the current temperature , only the set point -rrb- , and the a/c unit sometimes have a spasm of dull clunk when start up .<ssssss>pretty distracting .<ssssss>- footstep at 6am from above , hard shoe on hard floor .<ssssss>my room be carpet so i be not sure what be upstairs .<ssssss>i be very surprised that this brand-new building allow this sort of sound to travel between floor .<ssssss>earplug to the rescue .<ssssss>- at one point the hotel staff want to deliver I a message about my stay , and so they send I what they call a text message -- deliver somehow through they voice mail system .<ssssss>use the message button on my room phone , the robot say something like to retrieve you text message , press 5 .<ssssss>when i press 5 , it transfer I to another line that ring forever with no pickup .<ssssss>after 2 day of have all 3 of the phone in the room blinking madly and brightly -lrb- think nighttime -rrb- , i ask the front desk to make it stop .<ssssss>i mention that my attempt to retrieve the message send I into phone purgatory , but i be not sure they pick up on the need to investigate this whole system 's reliability .<ssssss>i really do not get the concept .<ssssss>just leave I a voice message !<ssssss>- i could not figure out how to make the tv display the signal from the provide dvd player , after press many button .<ssssss>i call the front desk for assistance , ask to speak to someone who know how to work it .<ssssss>they forward my call to engineering when i end up in a apparently off-duty employee 's voice mailbox -lrb- 8:30 pm -rrb- .<ssssss>this be not helpful .<ssssss>- $ 10/day for wifus .<ssssss>while not exactly a rough edge , it be extremely peculiar to I that the high end hotel all charge for this and the lower end hotel never do .<ssssss>- one of the thing about this level of hotel be the huge amount of staff hang around want to greet and help you .<ssssss>on one occasion i must have see 8 staff member linger in the front vestibule -- they be not in the way , but it seem like overkill .<ssssss>the door themselves be somewhat heavy , and there be no power assist on they .<ssssss>the theory must be that the plentiful staff mean you rarely have to handle they .<ssssss>except that the staff be not always there !<ssssss>i would say i have to open at least one of the door about 1/4 of the time come and go .<ssssss>when i arrive at 1am from a late flight , there be no one in sight .<ssssss>now i do not mind open door !<ssssss>-- even with my luggage , these be not bad .<ssssss>but i do find myself wonder how elderly guest feel about this .<ssssss>i think a wheelchair-bound person would have to just sit and wait until someone wander by and see they ...<ssssss>

3 4 3 5 2 3 3 2		book the cheapest room and get a 12 '' tv first of all , this be my 7th stay at the pk .<ssssss>the room and service have certainly improve .<ssssss>this be a tourist class hotel .<ssssss>do not be mislead by any website 's star rating .<ssssss>it be a solid three at time and a meager two at other , but not a bit more or less .<ssssss>the people who post the worst picture pay the least .<ssssss>in a ideal word this should not be , but in the world where we exchange money for service it really be .<ssssss>even spg rate it a cat 3 out of highest 7 -lrb- not five -rrb- .<ssssss>do not expect to book the cheapest room on the block in a tourist class hotel in this area of waikiki and expect luxury .<ssssss>if you pay for a standard , expect one .<ssssss>they will usually move you to a better room if they have space to improve you experience .<ssssss>sign up to be a spg member beforehand and book through they site , they price guarantee be good .<ssssss>it be a large hotel , something like 1100 room , and have vary level of comfort .<ssssss>there be the tower , 29 floor , sweet sleeper , flat screen tv .<ssssss>the ocean view odd number room do not get much sun , but the even number one do .<ssssss>there be very comfortable suite on the top two floor call ` series 71 ' and ` series 82 ' .<ssssss>but there can be housekeeping issue in the suite as well-once , we actually look up at the ceiling light over the bed , suite , 2871 , and there be giant ball of dust around the light , the a/c vent be nasty , and mold in the bathroom tile grout .<ssssss>but , in general , basic housekeeping be efficient .<ssssss>i do not think the maid climb up on bed to dust the 10 ' ceiling .<ssssss>almost all room in this building have some sort of ocean view above the 12th floor .<ssssss>four elevator generally very quick.there be the middle building , i think 12 floor , which have sweet sleeper , but i do not think flat screen yet .<ssssss>on the highest floor of this building be various suite of vary quality .<ssssss>here you be directly across from the pool , with a good view of the westin moana and a ocean view if you be far enough up .<ssssss>on the backside you be out of luck .<ssssss>you be low to the street and the noise can be brutal , and quite frankly the view stink .<ssssss>on the city side there be no lanais.and there be the wing on the right of check-in , usually reserve as ` crew ' room for flight crew and ` bulk group tourist get the cheapest rate ' type .<ssssss>these be you two star room which have no sweet sleeper , 12 inch tv , and even the sink be on two aluminum stand -lrb- you can actually lift the sink up -rrb- .<ssssss>the housekeeping be generally good because they need the aircrew business .<ssssss>the room be old but amazingly efficient with fantastic use of space .<ssssss>but this building be really you last choice.i have also hear of something call the annex , with extra cheap room , but i have never risk it.contrary to what some other reviewer post , there be room service .<ssssss>there just be not any past 2130 .<ssssss>a small pot of coffee add up to about $ 9.53 by the time the service fee -lrb- 17 % -rrb- and deliver fee -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- get add on .<ssssss>and the breakfast be a bit expensive by the time you add on coffee and juice .<ssssss>but people order room service for a reason so if you want to splurge-splurge , and do not complain.the prime rib buffet be always good downstairs , but i think it get a bit expensive for everyday .<ssssss>there be always as much snow crab as one can eat .<ssssss>they always offer a seafood , poultry , and pork option in the buffet .<ssssss>there be always a pasta choice .<ssssss>and it be a good opportunity to try some japanese style salad , sushi -lrb- very limited -rrb- , and tofu 's .<ssssss>there be always a good selection of bread .<ssssss>there be a very good selection of fresh locally make desert .<ssssss>the usual ice cream bar and melon and pineapple choice round out the dinner buffet .<ssssss>there be also a-la-carte option to choose from .<ssssss>there be also the requisite waikiki hula show , every night.the breakfast buffet be interesting .<ssssss>you can have anything make to order by just asking-they do not tell you this , but i have do it several time .<ssssss>one can also treat oneself to the japanese style breakfast .<ssssss>most people be the usual bacon and egg type so they pay for the buffet and complain there be no choice and it be not worth the 22 buck per person .<ssssss>but there be not many place where one can get ` all you can eat ' salmon for breakfast or fermented soy bean with mustard .<ssssss>momoya can be great , just be prepare for smaller portion .<ssssss>the service be good , it seem to I the same staff have be there for a few year .<ssssss>the price be reasonable.the pikake lounge .<ssssss>well , what can i say ?<ssssss>land of leisure suit larry 's and lounge lizard .<ssssss>kid .<ssssss>the staff be obviously union and not worry about be fire for customer complaint .<ssssss>they understandably do not remember all they client , but as a return client i certainly remember they all .<ssssss>they can be downright rude .<ssssss>i have wait 25 minute for a server to even acknowledge my presence .<ssssss>and i have have to put up with several of they give I attitude or just plain non-chalance .<ssssss>the drink quality be inconsistent , invariably .<ssssss>but then again there have be time where they have be downright fantastic.hint , if you want to have a few drink at one of the partner hotel , compare price for drink and app with those at the pk .<ssssss>the menu be the same , but the price about 20 % lower at pk.the front desk staff be there to help .<ssssss>there be time when they can be short , but , in general , they be friendly .<ssssss>they always seem to have a way to help I with my issue .<ssssss>there be a time when the front desk supervisor and a few of the clerk be miserable sod , but they seem to have all move on to greener pasture .<ssssss>i tend to remember people by name .<ssssss>good job sherri , jame , june , shauna .<ssssss>not so good job new guy work night -lrb- forgetful -rrb- and day-girl whose name sound like the indian word for tea but slightly different -lrb- very short -rrb- .<ssssss>always , always , always , check you bill before you leave .<ssssss>i have the experience , three year ago , of have they -lrb- they accounting department -rrb- contact I 7 month after my stay to say they have not charge I fully !!!<ssssss>stick up for yourself , but do not be rude to they , ie realize that although this be you vacation it be they job -lrb- tourist class hotel , not five star -rrb- the pool be there , always clean , lifeguard on duy , and always colder than the ocean .<ssssss>the towel and chair attendant be always great except the female whose name begin with y. never have luck with she .<ssssss>sign in and out for towel with you room key .<ssssss>really cool new thing be the ability to sign out beach chair for the day .<ssssss>these have to be back by 1730 or keep till the next day , but they stop take they back at 1730 no matter what.the hotel location be fantastic .<ssssss>the public beach be right across the street .<ssssss>the westin , royal hawaiian -lrb- currently close for renovation -rrb- , and sheraton waikiki beach be also available for pk customer use.there be a fee for internet , around $ 14 and change per day .<ssssss>tough to find wireless , but if you be on the oceanside of the tower you can pick up the new apple store 's wireless .<ssssss>or you can sign up with the skywave and have wireless everywhere , it be much cheaper than hotel internet .<ssssss>forget about use the phones.overall the hotel be date and nowhere near the quality of she sister along the beach .<ssssss>but it be a family friendly hotel .<ssssss>we stay here because we be platinum spg - thus we can book a low-medium price room and expect the upgrade , although that be also no guarantee .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 1 1 1 1		be careful the building need renovation .<ssssss>the carpet be stain and dirty .<ssssss>the view be great but it be all downhill from there .<ssssss>the staff act like they would prefer it if there be no guest .<ssssss>we purchase a package which include some meal , but they refuse to honor they .<ssssss>the credit for meal do not include the main resturant and of course the staff do not explain where the correct resturant be located .<ssssss>we even have trouble mail a package home .<ssssss>the staff could not figure out how to do it so we have to go to the post office .<ssssss>there be time we be try to walk down a hallway the the staff would have it completely block and would not move .<ssssss>we have to go down or up a floor and then back down to pass they .<ssssss>several time during we stay i hear other guest ask for help on several different matter and the answer be always the same .<ssssss>we do not do that .<ssssss>i suggest look at one of the other hotel in the area , i know i would never return .<ssssss>

4 4 5 2 5 4 4 5		clean we just come home from two week in oahu .<ssssss>we stay at the equus after have it recommend by expedia at the last minute .<ssssss>we originally have book in another hotel closer to the beach that refuse to accomodate what we pay for with expedia - so we transferred.the equus be a quaint smaller hotel of approx .<ssssss>100 room .<ssssss>there be no ocean view but possibly a marina view from some of the higher floor in the front corner room .<ssssss>the front desk staff be very friendly and helpful and be able to answer any question we had.the room be very clean and comfortable .<ssssss>we have a queen bed in a canopy make of bamboo which be very cool and just what you would expect for hawaius .<ssssss>the room have a great refrigerator/freezer combo and granite countertop in both the room and bathroom .<ssssss>no tub but stand up shower make of tumbled granite which be fine for we .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable and slide door lead to a lanai with city view .<ssssss>we also have a terrific flat screen tv in we room on the wall .<ssssss>so much better than other hotel with the old tv nail to the bureau.the hotel also have free internet right through the tv with a wireless keyboard and mouse right in the room , which be fantastic .<ssssss>a very cool bonus and completely handy .<ssssss>for those who need something print they have a complete setup in the lobby at .20 cent a min .<ssssss>+ .35 print per page , but it be well worth the convenience .<ssssss>we love be able to check email , check bus route on thebus.org before we head out for the day .<ssssss>this be a fabulous perk to stay with the equus.additionally , the hotel offer a nice continental breakfast each morning of coffee , orange or guava juice , fruit cocktail , fresh whole fruit and a variety of roll , muffin , etc. very nice and great touch.the downside to stay at this hotel first be the location .<ssssss>while it be very convenient to the ala moana shopping center and bus route , the only beach option be to cut across the hilton hawaiian village and use that beach or take the bus down to waikikus .<ssssss>if you be to walk to the waikiki beach it would take 20-30 minute .<ssssss>we do it but be hot by the time we get there .<ssssss>we ultimately use the hilton beach most day .<ssssss>also , the street noise be very loud .<ssssss>we do not get a good night sleep any of the night because of the noise from the street .<ssssss>there be little the hotel can do for this so take ear plug unless you be use to city noise .<ssssss>there be no laundry facility at this hotel , they recommend you walk to the aqua condo building behind the hotel and go to they 3rd floor coin operate laundry , however when we do this there be 3 people wait there for they laundry and be use the 2 work machine .<ssssss>so we haul we laundry down the street to a laundromat .<ssssss>the elevator in this hotel be handy , however we have serious rain on we trip and it seem the elevator go out of service in heavy rain .<ssssss>this make it necessary for we to walk up to we room and count the flight of stair to the lobby then up to we 7th floor room it be a bit of a pain .<ssssss>this would have present a major problem for anyone with a infirmity or major handicap.finally , the pool .<ssssss>the pool be very well maintained but small with a heavy rush of move water in the middle .<ssssss>i never once see anyone in it .<ssssss>it be border on all side by building and be not invite .<ssssss>pretty to look at but not functional , as a matter of fact i do not notice if it have stair , however i do not go close to look.i would recommend the equus for a clean nice place to stay , but if you be look to spend every day at the beach with little effort you would be better off pay a bit more to stay closer .<ssssss>if you be on business this be perfect since you be close to the convention center , ala moana and the free internet in the room.overall we enjoy we stay at the equus and the benefit far outweigh the downside .<ssssss>compare to the hotel we be initially book in it be light year better .<ssssss>it be everything a boutique hotel should be .<ssssss>

4 4 4 3 5 2 2 5		nice hotel , but ... get a little ` lose in translation ' i be pretty picky when it come to hotel .<ssssss>the two thing i look for in a hotel be the aesthetics -lrb- modern hotel be a plus -rrb- and the cleanliness .<ssssss>well this hotel meet expectation for both of these area .<ssssss>the hotel be very modern , the room be a very nice size and the room i have be very clean .<ssssss>now to the service -lrb- which be really not a big deal for I as long as the aesthetics and cleanliness meet my expectation -rrb- , the service could use some improving , or perhaps it be just the front desk person who assist I .<ssssss>service issue # 1 : my reservation be book by my company and clearly request a king size bed .<ssssss>when i arrive to my room , i find two twin bed .<ssssss>so i go back down to the front desk and graciously ask the same gentleman who check I in to honor my reservation and to place I in a king-bed room .<ssssss>he change I to a different room , but of course with a little attitude .<ssssss>so i go to my new room and before i walk in , i notice the door of the room across from mine have what appear to be a large amount of mold grow on it .<ssssss>i dismiss it to possibly be cause by a recent flood , but when i walk into my room , it reek of this mold smell .<ssssss>i immediately go back down to the front desk and tell he about this and request a different room .<ssssss>well , at this point he be extremely agitate by I and immediately tell I that there be no other room -lrb- w/o even look in the computer -rrb- .<ssssss>so i tell he to just put I back into my original room because the smell of mold be unbearable .<ssssss>grow even more agitate now , he snatch my room key away from I and exchange my room .<ssssss>i dismiss it because at this point i be exhaust and i just want to get to a decent room .<ssssss>service issue # 2 : the first night in my room i notice that it be extremely cold .<ssssss>i try adjust the thermostat but the room never get any warmer .<ssssss>the next day i inform the front desk , so they send housekeeping to my room â€˜to adjust the thermostat for meâ€ ?<ssssss>-lrb- despite my tell they that i have already try this -rrb- .<ssssss>.<ssssss>housekeeping adjust the thermostat -lrb- same way i do the evening prior -rrb- and tell I to just wait .<ssssss>well after a few hour of shiver i phone the front desk again .<ssssss>they tell I , â€œwell sorry nothing we can do , we can bring you more blankets.â€?more blanket ???<ssssss>itâ€™s november in beij and very cold outsideâ€?i want heat , not extra blanket !!!<ssssss>i tell they i do not need more blanket , i need maintenance to come up to fix the issue .<ssssss>they finally send maintenance up and the heating be soon fixed.despite my mishap with the service , all in all this be a very nice hotel and iâ€™d still recommend it to a friend .<ssssss>just the whole language barrier can get in the way at time -lrb- as iâ€™m sure can happen at any hotel when youâ€™re in a foreign country -rrb- .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 3 3 1		great location , close to everything we recently stay at the hotel for a two day getaway and be quite happy with the place .<ssssss>the room be small but clean and have update decor .<ssssss>we do not have a chance to eat at the restaurant , but it be trendy the menu look quite good .<ssssss>the hotel have a fantastic location , especially since we be do the tourist thing , and walk all over the downtown area .<ssssss>it be 10 minute to pike place market , the monorail , and to pioneer square -lrb- lot of street people -rrb- .<ssssss>since it be a old building the room be a little noisy during the night -lrb- door slam , pipe run , etc. -rrb- so if you be a light sleeper bring earplug .<ssssss>the internet in the lobby be spotty and quite slow , so do not expect to do any work there .<ssssss>service be very good we like that seattle 's best coffee shop be just off the lobby .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 4 4 -1 5		not worth it , no way the st. regi remind I of texa culture : a mile wide and a inch deep .<ssssss>once you get past all the very ostentatious artistic touch , you find that the design be all there be , because the management have not get all the practical detail of run a hotel nail down .<ssssss>at this price level , there should be absolutely no negative on one 's list , but this property have many : the street noise in the room be indescribable .<ssssss>evidently market street , a block away , be a main route for fire equipment on that end of town , so a unrelenting cacophany of they siren , horn , and bell go on all night .<ssssss>the architect should have spend much more on soundproofing and far less on frippery.no night light .<ssssss>with the blackout curtain draw , it be impossible to find the bathroom without awaken one 's partner by turn on a light .<ssssss>a small thing , perhaps , but a continual annoyance unanticipated in a $ 450 room .<ssssss>the lcd control panel be handy , but it need a brightness control.the tv menu do not reflect what be actually play at the moment .<ssssss>another minor inconvenience , but frustrate when one be try to find a specific program .<ssssss>motel 6 level service.the hall carpet on we floor -lrb- 15 -rrb- have a track down the middle that appear nearly wear out .<ssssss>my companion think the look be intentional .<ssssss>if so , it be a lousy style choice.the food be run-of-the-mill hotel fare , only at michelin 5-star price .<ssssss>i do not care what you put in a short stack of pancake - nothing make they worth $ 16 .<ssssss>but i will acknowledge that the coffee be awesome.the housekeeping staff do not seem to understand the concept of a do not disturb sign on the door to a guest room .<ssssss>on more than one occasion , we be nap with the sign on and a housekeeper let herself in to refresh towel or turn down the bed .<ssssss>nice service ; lousy co-ordination .<ssssss>no coffee or tea in the room .<ssssss>i like a hot cup when i get out of bed -lrb- not when room service find it convenient -rrb- .<ssssss>a iron and/or steamer in the room would be nice for those touch-up that do not warrant a $ 20 , 2-hour round trip to the valet.in short , the amenity , detail , finish touch , be not up to the standard one find in a run-of-the-mill chain .<ssssss>for they to be lack in a property of this price be near criminal .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 3 2 3 4		disappointing we use ta as we bible and be encourage by the review of this hotel .<ssssss>as usual many of the comment be totally bang on , especially .<ssssss>.<ssssss>excellent concierge ask I service excellent location noisy liftbut .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we book rm602 -lrb- the meeting suite -rrb- not 502 as everyone seem to suggest .<ssssss>its one of they 2 suite -lrb- above rm 502 we overlook they terrace -rrb- at front .<ssssss>we get over the complicated light switch but could not cope with the poorly maintain bathroom .<ssssss>we shower do not leak but only partially work .<ssssss>the overhead shower head dribble out ok but no power shower , but the handheld do not work and the tap have come out of the wall .<ssssss>the slide door between the bathroom and bedroom always jam stick .<ssssss>this be very irritating.we be family of 3 and book the suite think it would be big enough for we daughter bed .<ssssss>it be not really - be just a big room with wonderful glass window overlook street .<ssssss>fine for a couple not for family.when do a room become a suite ?<ssssss>i always think that a suite be more than one room but obviously not.the concierge be excellent - make booking give advice etc. the rest of the staff be good look but useless .<ssssss>the pretty boy who wait breakfast should stay on the beach .<ssssss>the doorman in the silly hat more concerned with how they look than look after you.so you do not think this review be waste i will give you 2 non-touristy place to eat .<ssssss>modern tapa at paco meralgo -lrb- carrer de muntaner -rrb- and where they still treat tourist as interesting guest and for lunch -lrb- excellent fish -rrb- l'olivÃ© -lrb- balme 47 -rrb- .<ssssss>the food at both these place be very good .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 2 3 1 -1		so average we stay at this hotel for a week when my son need emergency medical care in singapore .<ssssss>we need two connect room .<ssssss>both smell so strongly of cigarette that it be difficult to stay there .<ssssss>to mask the smell , strong room deoderant be spray every time the room be clean .<ssssss>it be hard to say which be worse.my room service experience be dismal both time .<ssssss>the first evening , half the food arrive and not as i have request it .<ssssss>the second evening it do not come at all .<ssssss>when i call down to check on it , they obviously rush the order because it be not fully cook , and again , not entirely as i have order it .<ssssss>i give up after that.the room , in short , be dismal and tired and need serious refurbishment.on the upside , it be one of the cheaper hotel in singapore and be close to orchard road and other main attraction .<ssssss>the employee at the front desk be friendly and the bell hop be very helpful.other than that , not at all exciting .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 3 3 -1		great boutique style hotel , awesome location a friend and i stay one night at this modern boutique style hotel .<ssssss>we book through hotwire .<ssssss>originally we be reserve a queen bed but the hotel be able to accomodate we request for two double bed upon check-in .<ssssss>we room be on the 10th floor and quite spacious , which be a pleasant surprise .<ssssss>instead of valet parking for $ 25/day we park in the lot right across the street for $ 17/day on weekend or $ 10/10 hour .<ssssss>the red fin restaurant have a good happy hour menu start at 10pm .<ssssss>would highly recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 4 3 5 2		good value for the price .<ssssss>the courtyard view from we balcony<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 4 5 5 5		very good but not excellent first impression from the outside be that it be very date , but most of the inside tell a different story .<ssssss>when i say most , we stay in the horizon tower and , in my opinion , this be show itsâ€?age .<ssssss>donâ€™t get I wrong , the room be very clean , adequate and a comfortable bed , but i didnâ€™t think â€œooh this be niceâ€?when i walk in , it just feel like a normal good standard room that could do with a bit of update .<ssssss>other post have mention that they room have recently be renovate , i can only assume they hadnâ€™t do ours yet .<ssssss>one other comment about the room , although not a major issue , be that it do not have a separate shower as mention on the website room description.we book directly with the hotel , they website give different package option and they say they wonâ€™t be beat on price .<ssssss>we decide to go with the club room and glad that we do when we find out the price of food and drink at the hotel , and outside for that matter .<ssssss>we take breakfast in the blu restaurant on the club floor , this be excellent with plenty of choice with the buffet and a la carte menu - and the fried egg be cook exactly to order , not a easy thing apparently judge by the other hotel we stay at on this trip !<ssssss>if not include in the price , breakfast cost sg $ 40 a person .<ssssss>all the staff on the club floor be very pleasant , attentive and would help with anything you ask for .<ssssss>we do make the most of the club lounge and go to the early evening cocktail drink each night .<ssssss>iâ€™m glad we do as the first night we go to a outside restaurant , nothing grand , a can of guinness cost sg $ 18 .<ssssss>we also find out later that the cocktail in the hotel be sg $ 25 a go , so the additional cost of the club lounge well and truly pay for itself.we also try some of the local food outside the hotel .<ssssss>we eat at the maxwell hawker centre in chinatown , limited choice of mainly chicken and rice but food be excellent and cheap at sg $ 3 a meal .<ssssss>the lady concierge at the hotel recommend a good roti pratta cafÃ© near river valley road , fantastic !<ssssss>it be a true local place and the roti and chicken curry be excellent and less than sg $ 10 for two .<ssssss>overall the service and staff at the hotel be very good and the hotel be in a convenient location within walk distance to the shop , restaurant and bar of orchard road as well as the mrt .<ssssss>for the price though , i have stay at better hotel and would probably check out the other if i be to return to singapore .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 5 2 2 1		my second time there this time it suck this be my second time to punta cana and at this hotel .<ssssss>my first stay be wonderful .<ssssss>so i decide to go back with my boyfriend .<ssssss>what a mistake .<ssssss>the first day we get there we door be break the repairman do not know how to fix it and my boyfriend end up do it .<ssssss>plus we give he a $ 10 tip before hand thinking he know what he be doing!the remote for we tv do not work we go down to the reception area and be give 3 different control .<ssssss>we be than give a $ 5.00 credit to use at the casino and when we actually win they take the 5.00 away from us.one night we go to dinner and be not give any sort of drink , we ask 4 time .<ssssss>i must say the food be great .<ssssss>but that all .<ssssss>at dinner one night we get up to go get desert and we return we find out that we table have be give away !<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 4 5 4 -1		a little disappointed the review in tripadvisor mostly rave about this place .<ssssss>it do not live up to we expectation .<ssssss>first , i would advise other go to the island to stay at a place in esperanza where there be a few more restautant , shop and thing to do and that be where the best beach be .<ssssss>second , bbh be a old motel redone .<ssssss>if you look at the picture on they web site you will see a lovely and minimilistic room .<ssssss>it really be minimiistic .<ssssss>one lamp , one bed side table and one chair for a room with a king bed -lrb- mean for two -rrb- .<ssssss>so ... one of we could read at a time !<ssssss>also we air conditioning be break .<ssssss>they promise to fix it by the next day .<ssssss>i like to be cool , so i be not so happy .<ssssss>but we room do look over the ocean and we could open the door to the balcony and get a lovely breeze and fall asleep to the sound of the ocean .<ssssss>there be no screen on the door , but there be misquito net for the bed .<ssssss>the bathroom be very small .<ssssss>there be two pool , one only open during meal the other near the honor bar .<ssssss>neither be impressive.now the good stuff ... while the air be never fix they do not charge we over and above we deposit for we two day stay .<ssssss>they do provide chair and towel to take to the beach ... a real must .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be fabulous , with terrific banana muffin and homemade granola .<ssssss>the setting for breakfast be the terrace overlook the ocean .<ssssss>the staff be accomodate and the linen -lrb- which they boast of -rrb- be really luxurious .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 3 4 4 -1		burn baby burn some 15 hour ago i return from a 5-day long vacation at the catalonia bavaro resort in punta cana .<ssssss>let 's get directly to the point chronologically : the ride from the airport to catalonia bavaro be ok .<ssssss>the airport , the people there and the overall logistics be what give you the basic notion of the country you be in .<ssssss>practical , honest and down to earth people try to make a living .<ssssss>despite the phenomenal nature , the people should be consider the country 's primary asset and treasure .<ssssss>it do not take long to get to the complex itself .<ssssss>the check-in be fine and fast -lrb- 3:00 pm check-in ! -rrb-<ssssss>but bear in mind that be respectful and proactiv -lrb- not pushy ! -rrb-<ssssss>do the trick .<ssssss>be respectful do a lot more than a $ 1 tip , though the tip be always welcome and well deserve .<ssssss>we have lunch while we room be be prepare .<ssssss>the buffet be not great but very very very good .<ssssss>so be all the food and drink on the premise .<ssssss>i have relatively high expectation and consequently i have zero tolerance for people whose review brand the food and the service in catalonia bavaro as poor .<ssssss>i find the beachside buffet much more comfortable for breakfast and lunch.the room be nothing special , but it be well keep during my stay there .<ssssss>i tip the maid every morning -lrb- $ 1 - $ 2 -rrb- .<ssssss>well condition and plenty of hot water .<ssssss>the nature be stunning and the grounds be meticulously keep .<ssssss>no argument about that .<ssssss>there be people take care of the scenery all the time .<ssssss>marvelous place.the beach be spectacular .<ssssss>the only downside about it come from the tourist themselves .<ssssss>many people seem to be quite disrespectful about they fellow traveler and occupy the cabanas whole day long without actually use they .<ssssss>they just put a towel underneath and they have a reserved giant cabana that could host a whole family for the whole day while you burn in the sun with a actual sizzle sound .<ssssss>the palm be beautiful bot not likely to give you any protection from the sun .<ssssss>i will really have to capitalize this : use lot of sun block !<ssssss>ignore this and you will turn this paradise into a place you will resent for the rest of you life .<ssssss>eat and drink all you want , but do not neglect you skin protection or you will get not just severe sun burn but actual wound as if you go through live fire .<ssssss>the pool be huge .<ssssss>love it , although i do not use it very much .<ssssss>would you stay by the pool if you have the best caribbean beach a few step away ?<ssssss>do not waste you time by the pool , go to the beach .<ssssss>if you do not like sand , natural beach and beauty you should not have go to the caribbean in the first place.the service be great .<ssssss>the best thing about it be that nobody seem to be give you that tip I or go to hell look .<ssssss>that make you feel even more generous and they seem to have discover that way in advance .<ssssss>those people deserve whatever there be that you be willing to share with they .<ssssss>however , the most important thing be to be respectful .<ssssss>i only try two of the a la carte restaurant .<ssssss>go to the japanese one as soon as you can .<ssssss>skip the mexican one .<ssssss>use very strong mosquito repellent at the monday beach party.checkout be fast.overall : i love it .<ssssss>use sun block .<ssssss>be careful not to catch a cold at the beach in the late afternoon due to the strong wind .<ssssss>try the catamaran - it be great .<ssssss>the snorkele trip be fine but not great .<ssssss>do it only if you necessarily need to tease the folk back home about it .<ssssss>;-rrb- .<ssssss>eat and drink reasonably .<ssssss>you do not need to feel full all the time , it can definitely ruin the whole experience for you .<ssssss>a good place for a good price .<ssssss>will upload photo soon .<ssssss>

4 5 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		review be pretty accurate be write this in the room as we pack up after 5 night stay .<ssssss>great location on russian hill .<ssssss>the staff very friendly .<ssssss>light daily continental breakfast -lrb- muffin sweet roll -rrb- , tea , but no fresh coffee .<ssssss>we stay in the 2 bedroom family suite , which be very large by sf standard .<ssssss>have a king bed in the main room , with a separate bedroom which have 2 full size bed .<ssssss>the bedroom be not cramp with the two bed .<ssssss>bed comfortable , quiet , and sheet soft .<ssssss>large pillow .<ssssss>tv 's one 25 in each room .<ssssss>microwave , fridge and wet bar area with that gross hotel pack coffee in it .<ssssss>overall , be very pleased with the choice .<ssssss>3 little aggravation .<ssssss>1 .<ssssss>hard parking , but free -lrb- a luxury in sf -rrb- 2 .<ssssss>we be on 1st floor and could hear foot pressure walk above we at all hour of the night .<ssssss>no talking , but walk .<ssssss>3 .<ssssss>the cleaning staff really clean the room , but love the bleach and the room have to be air out when we come in after a day 's sightseeing .<ssssss>-lrb- but i have a sensitive nose -rrb- .<ssssss>we have one window , with a view of the side of the office building next door .<ssssss>but we be not in the room that much anyway.rec .<ssssss>a visit to the muir wood while in sf .<ssssss>, really recommend a little known trail in the golden gate recreation area on the way from sausilito , to the muir wood .<ssssss>it be know as the tennessee valley trail .<ssssss>it be about a 1.5 mi walk each way on a fairly flat trail to a lovely secluded beach .<ssssss>there be no tourist there , just a few local .<ssssss>we have total private use of the beach for about a hour .<ssssss>deer , bird , etc. it be great.all in all the hotel bill be under 1k .<ssssss>for 5 night , be very satisfied .<ssssss>thanks reviewer !<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 4 1 3 -1		beware this be not a 5 * hotel .<ssssss>bathroom<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 3 -1		hate this hotel i have just return from south beach miami , where i stay at the casablanca on the ocean .<ssssss>on they website they say they be newly renovate , well i get there to find out that this be far from true .<ssssss>i request a room overlook the ocean , which i get , however it be terrible .<ssssss>you can hear the guest in the room above and in the room beside you and they be quite loud .<ssssss>the hall way be dark and spooky .<ssssss>i find most of the staff to be unfriendly and rude .<ssssss>maybe if i speak spanish they would be more friendly as all the staff be spanish .<ssssss>i also find the valet to be rude and unfriendly .<ssssss>i would not recommend anyone stay there .<ssssss>i rate the hotel a ... negative 5 star .<ssssss>!!!<ssssss>
2 3 4 4 4 2 1 -1		skip it we travel book recommend this hotel .<ssssss>we get a good deal on a room so we decide to stay here .<ssssss>my husband and i travel to puerto rico with travel back pack instead of you classic luggage because we be move around a lot .<ssssss>from the moment we walk in the door i feel that the staff treat we poorly .<ssssss>we arrive too early to check in so we decide to use the pool while we wait for we room .<ssssss>the pool lady seem very suspicious of we and just hand we beach towel without say anything .<ssssss>the pool be freezing cold .<ssssss>the hotel be on the beach , but the beach be dirty and right next to a public park so there be a ton of random kid run around .<ssssss>the room and amenity be nice but other than that , i would say skip this hotel and find a place where the staff treat everyone as a guest .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 3 5 5 -1		a great bargain for san francisco i have stay at the marina motel many time .<ssssss>for one thing , parking be free in individual covered space .<ssssss>that be no small deal because a typical hotel will charge $ 20 - $ 30 per night for parking in san francisco .<ssssss>if you be look for a holiday-inn-style place this be probably not you motel .<ssssss>this be a 1930 's vintage motel and that be part of its charm .<ssssss>all the bathroom have be modernize , and the staff keep the place very clean .<ssssss>if you can get one of the room with a kitchen , it will really help you keep you expense down by eat a few meal in you room .<ssssss>there be a bunch of great restaurant at various price level within walk distance of the motel .<ssssss>the staff at the motel be really friendly and extremely helpful .<ssssss>one caveat , i always request a room that be away from lombard street because it be a heavily travel street with a lot of noise .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 4 2 2 2		so so overall i be look forward to stay at the hotel but the hotel itself be nothing special .<ssssss>firstly the reception staff be not helpful or friendly at all on arrival .<ssssss>actualy they make I feel very uncomfortable .<ssssss>the room itself on the club floor be a harbor view and although not picture perfect it be very nice .<ssssss>the room itself be date , old and in need of a renovation .<ssssss>the club floor receptionist be not friendly nor helpful at all .<ssssss>the distance from downtown be fine and i use taxi .<ssssss>on checkout i pay a portion of the bill in cash and the balance on credit card .<ssssss>i be charge the full amount on my credit card .<ssssss>when i say again that i have pay nearly we $ 800 in cash -lrb- just less than 30 seconds before -rrb- the receptionist say that i didnt !!<ssssss>very strange behaviour !<ssssss>anyway it all get sort out , but i feel like i have do something wrong !<ssssss>no apolagy at all , just a sour look from the staff !<ssssss>overall not really impressed at all and would not stay here again !<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 3 3 4		do not waste you time ... or you money .<ssssss>my family stay at the riu palace punta cana from december 1-8 , 2007 .<ssssss>i will agree with the other reviewer that the hotel itself be spectacular .<ssssss>we have no issue with check-in , the staff be lovely and the room be nice and clean.however ... the smell of raw sewage seep into the room be repulsive .<ssssss>public washroom smell better and there be no room spray that could have make a difference .<ssssss>i be fascinate by the people who say that the food be great and there be lot of variety at the buffet .<ssssss>i have be to a number of resort and i know not to expect fantastic food when i be away .<ssssss>i would have be happy with mediocre , but the riu palace do not even deserve that review .<ssssss>the food be awful , often undercooked , and they pretty much serve the exact same food night and day .<ssssss>other than mexican night -lrb- which be the one enjoyable meal -rrb- they do not seem to have any theme night and for such a big resort the size of the buffet be very disappointing .<ssssss>also , the special each night be present again the next day at the lunch restaurant .<ssssss>i live off bread and butter most day , which be a welcome alternative to what they be serving.although i have a nice time on my vacation , i would not recommend the riu palace to anyone .<ssssss>this be a shame because it be such a nice look resort and with better food and less sewage smell it would have be perfect .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 3 3 -1		room be a pleasant surprise i have read that ibis room be small and the bathroom extremely compact -- it be a pleasant surprise to find that there be plenty of space for a one-night stay and the bathroom very efficiently organize .<ssssss>everything be crisply clean and comfortable , and the hotel be well-located for easy train access to the city attraction .<ssssss>the restaurant be noisy and there be minor mistake with we order , but we experience overall be a good one .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 4 1 1 4		hotel majestic - a mixed bag .<ssssss>stay at the hotel majestic for a week in late november , book as a 5-star choice from a list of conference hotel .<ssssss>as there be three of we stay in one room -lrb- married couple and a sister -rrb- , we inquire in advance if it would be possible to get a triple room , which they be happy to arrange for we at a supplement of 50 euro / night + 10 euro / night require breakfast charge .<ssssss>the kind woman in the sale department who help we with this request be lovely and could not be faulted.upon arrival we be take to a tiny smoking room with a sofabed pull out .<ssssss>the foot of the sofa bed rest against the foot of the double bed -lrb- more on that later -rrb- .<ssssss>have inform the hotel in advance that i be six month pregnant , i find they choice to put we in a smoking room odd and after ask politely they move we up one floor to a similarly tiny room , with dirty scuffed wall and grubby carpet .<ssssss>the furnishings be something you would expect to find in a holiday inn -lrb- i be serious -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be certainly not five star and we ask to be move again - this time a bellman be involve , and he steer we to a suitable room .<ssssss>bellman and housekeeper always know the nicest room in hotel , so take they advice!once we be finally ensconce in we room -lrb- pay another 30 euro a day for a upgrade to a superior room -rrb- we start to notice some interesting trend amongst the staff .<ssssss>this be a hotel where the staff be quite convinced that they be better than they guest - if you be not wear a fur coat and blahnik , you may as well be crawl out of the gutter .<ssssss>door be not open for we by the doorman , we be eyeball with disdain by the guy who stand on the stair -lrb- security ? -rrb-<ssssss>, and i once see a front desk clerk -lrb- they be all man who be 40 year + -rrb- look up at my sister - a really stunning redhead - and shake he head .<ssssss>we be wear very normal clothes : black trousers , black shoe -lrb- no tennis shoe -rrb- , cashmere sweater and the like .<ssssss>be pregnant , my clothes certainly be not chanel but i be not turn away from any restaurant in the city , so i figure i look ok .<ssssss>we have wear the same basic outfits for a week at the hotel imperial in vienna , which be a much nicer hotel , so i think it must have be a hotel majestic trademark to make the guest feel uncomfortable.one afternoon my sister and i -lrb- we be 29 yo and 39 yo -rrb- wander into the lobby bar for some coffee and a light lunch .<ssssss>the blond model-like bar attendant take we order , bring it to we and then disappear .<ssssss>as we be halfway through eat we pizza , another bar worker come through and put up menu for a afternoon tea they have be serve for a hour , something that the model man have neglect to tell we about .<ssssss>we be never offer refill , check on , anything , and when we finally get the server to give we we check we ask if we could put it on we room he throw he pen down on the table and walk off in a huff .<ssssss>breakfast be dull and we only go once , despite be force to pay a obligatory 10 euro a day per person for it .<ssssss>it be hold in a windowless conference room in the basement .<ssssss>every couple of minute the room shake from the metro that run right by the hotel .<ssssss>the staff be uninterested and unfriendly , and the food be very dull - pastry come from huge catering pack , etc.however , the thing that make I really cringe about this hotel , the thing that cement in my mind never again , be the bed situation .<ssssss>we book a double room .<ssssss>we see three of they .<ssssss>apparently , to the hotel majestic , a double bed be two twin make separately and then push together with a small blanket at the bottom .<ssssss>they make they bed by put on the bottom sheet , then the top sheet , blanket , another top sheet , and then tuck the entire affair under the mattress .<ssssss>anyone who have stay in a hotel where this be the common practice know that when you untuck you bed to get into it the bottom sheet come out as well , and unless you really want to slide around all night you have to re-tuck the bottom sheet in .<ssssss>imagine now that you be stay with you husband / wife / signficant other , and you have to separate the bed -lrb- they be on roller -rrb- , untuck the bed completely , retuck in the bottom sheet for both bed , then push the bed back together .<ssssss>there be no interaction between party in the separate bed , because you will fall through the crack between the bed -lrb- make especially dangerous since the bed be on roller -rrb- .<ssssss>every night for a week i go through this bedtime routine ; i have stay in many hotel where there be twin push together for a double bed , but they always make the bed as one bed , not two separate bed push together .<ssssss>it be absolutely infuriating , ridiculous and completely stupid for a five-star hotel .<ssssss>aside from this huge flaw , the housekeeping be very good.however , after a week of be completely frustrate by what i perceive to be a lower-range westin or even sheraton , i discover something that really make I laugh - they do roar cruise trade !!<ssssss>as i wait on a sofa by the elevator on my -lrb- thankfully -rrb- last day , i see stream of cruiser walk by , all dress in cruise wear , all much more poorly dress than we be and much less travel savvy .<ssssss>it make I smile to think that all these obviously high-class barcelona hotel clerk and bar waiter have to deal with these people all the time , and what a strain it must be for they to have to lower themselves to actually speak with such riff raff!my advice : stay somewhere else .<ssssss>the location be ok , but not great ; the staff be generally pretty much up themselves and what should be a welcome comfortable place wind up make you wish you be somewhere else .<ssssss>avoid .<ssssss>

2 3 3 3 3 5 2 2		food stink we recently return for a anniversary trip and be somewhat disappoint with the majestic .<ssssss>this be hardly a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>the service be adequate but not very helpful or friendly .<ssssss>the room be nice but freezing cold air conditioning and very musty .<ssssss>the food be the biggest disappointment .<ssssss>the salad bar be terrible .<ssssss>the fruit do not even taste as fresh as other caribean island .<ssssss>most choice be greasy or fried .<ssssss>the steak house and the japanese be good .<ssssss>my husband get very ill after eat at the gourmet .<ssssss>the drink be mostly all premade which stink .<ssssss>overall this place be alright but i would certainly have lower expectation compare to previous review .<ssssss>the pool and beach be excellent but would not return .<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 2 1 1 1		not bad , but not satisfy with service at all we stay at this hotel for 4 night in september and when we arrive i feel excute at first .<ssssss>the hotel be located nearby the beach and have its own beach access but the more day we stay the more remark i gather and finally i feel a little big negative about this hotel and next time i would not stay here anymore although the accomodation be really nice : remark ======= 1 -rrb- ridiculous resort fee : the only thing you get be a chair on the beach , everything else -lrb- hut , umbrella , ... -rrb- have to be pay .<ssssss>also the fishing pier be close , the whirlpool be not work and the business area be also close for day .<ssssss>so , why should we be pay a resort fee ???<ssssss>2 -rrb- very average frontdesk service : a -rrb- they business area be not work for day , they be not able to give I direction to a -lrb- open ! -rrb-<ssssss>internet cafÃ© on a saturday 3 pm !!!<ssssss>b -rrb- on one night we be wake up because in one of the neighbouring room a buzzer be go off all the time -lrb- a room where the previous owner do not switch it off -rrb- .<ssssss>we have to call the frontdesk several time and go physically there between 4 am and 6 be before they solve it .<ssssss>quite a joke !<ssssss>we could not sleep for hour c -rrb- when check out , we invoice be totally wrong , it even include day from the previous room guest .<ssssss>after explain this several time they finally make a new invoice but again this be completely wrong but it be less than reality this time .<ssssss>i give up after loose so much time and walk out laughing , quite some amateurism over there .3 -rrb- several time we do not get any new towel in the room and also 1 day the housekeeping be even forget , i also read this for many other people on this site .4 -rrb- the people who distribute towel at the pool area be extremely -lrb- !!! -rrb-<ssssss>unfriendly and openly show that they do not like they job , a shame for such a hotel5 -rrb- a big big congratulation from I to the valet boy .<ssssss>they be the only positive surprise to I , and espacially mr josÃ© .<ssssss>i decide to give they a nice tip when we check out , they be the only one who deserve it .<ssssss>
2 1 1 3 2 3 2 3		not impressed .<ssssss>we just return home from dallas today - we be in town for a wedding and my husband be the best man - so we room be pay for ... so see that we do not have to personally pay for the place help ... but i be not impressed - the lobby be hot , the elevator be terribly slow - small room , tiny bathroom ... we bathroom door wouldnt close and the picture for the tv be very grainy ... the place just do not feel clean .<ssssss>to top thing off ... the only have one , yes one luggage carrier for the entire hotel ... so we have to make several trip to unload .<ssssss>will not return .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 4 2 3 -1		great place , but must prepare ... first i must thank previous reviewer for they review and tripadvisor for the service.i stay recently as i have a conference in san juan at the caribe hilton .<ssssss>i do not want to spend the extra dough on a overpriced hotel so i stay at da house .<ssssss>after read the previous review , i be slightly nervous that i may not get the sleep require to be alert for activity throughout the day .<ssssss>so i bring my earplug and my trusty honeywell fan -lrb- that make lot of noise -rrb- and i do fine .<ssssss>i could hear the bass of the music slightly from my fourth floor room .<ssssss>i be not by the alleyway and i consider that a plus , as i be sure the insulation of window would not have help at all .<ssssss>i have reserve a room on the 3rd floor for 5 night and ask if i could be move to the 4th floor and they upgrade my room at no cost .<ssssss>the a/c be cold , and the bed be comfortable .<ssssss>i have hot water at all time -lrb- except for the last morning when my shower be not run at all -rrb- .<ssssss>there be not a lot of construction noise , but they be definitely present .<ssssss>the first morning after get up i go to the rooftop patio and there be 5-6 worker up there!the service be great and the staff be kind and accomidating but it be slightly ameteur-ish .<ssssss>the vibe of the hotel be very cool , the art be nice , and the location be really hard to beat as it be right around the corner from some chic resturaunt -lrb- i recommend dragonfly for fusion and cafe de puerto rico for great , reasonably price local cuisine -rrb- , and shopping.the room be clean .<ssssss>friend in town stay at a hotel in old sj over $ 100/night more expensive and have roach .<ssssss>but they do not clean the room daily , and i do not as they to freshen it up.i will definitely consider it again when i go back !<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 1 2 3		could use some work go to punta cana last april with my fiancee as the relaxing leg of a ski 'n' surf trip -lrb- we start in whistler bc , go to san fran to visit friend of my fiancee , then go to the dr after a stop back home in nyc -rrb- .<ssssss>book the royal service - a deluxe junior suite with jacuzzi .<ssssss>when we arrive at the hotel , we would just beat a major afternoon downpour .<ssssss>as other have mention , to check into the royal service , they have to truck you out to the royal service check in area , which be a short five-minute drive from the main building .<ssssss>by the time we have wait 20 minute for someone to take we out there , it be pour , so we hop onto a tarp-covered and soak wet passenger cart and speed through six inch deep pool of water try to keep at least we top-half dry by hold the plastic down as we go .<ssssss>they can not control the weather , but they could do better in keep people dry .<ssssss>frankly , the whole idea of a separate check-in may be exciting for some , but i would rather arrive and be show right to my room to settle in - i can get orient later.we slosh into the royal service check in area and be meet with blank stare when we tell they the name on we reservation - when book through orbitz or another online agency , make sure you print out you voucher .<ssssss>fortunately , i have my blackberry and be able to show they we reservation - tell they we reservation number be not good enough , and i be fairly convince they would have throw we out if we have not show they the email .<ssssss>after a hour of check in -lrb- much of it wait for someone to pay attention to we , then for we room to be ready -rrb- , we also book some reservation at a couple of the restaurant for the next few day -lrb- we will return to that later -rrb- .<ssssss>back into the rain and to we soak transportation , all the way across the property to a room on the far side .<ssssss>the room be large , damp , cold and uncomfortably furnished .<ssssss>the bed be hard and there be only a thin polyester blanket and some worn sheet , which be as damp as the rest of the room .<ssssss>it do not have a electronic safe , so i ask the porter to bring a lock for the old-fashioned safe to put away we valuable - it arrive the next night -lrb- after a complaint in the morning -rrb- and a second lock arrive the next morning -lrb- more on that later -rrb- .<ssssss>for kick back and relax during the day , it be wonderful - we enjoy breakfast and lunch at the royal service dining room .<ssssss>the royal service pool and beach be clean and relaxing , and the bartender be generally very friendly .<ssssss>i should note that there be a lot of smoker at and near the pool bar - i use to smoke regularly and still sometimes smoke on vacation , so it do not bother I , but i be sure other will be turn off by that.we hit the gym one day , which be decently appoint and have mostly work machine and a reasonable selection of free weight .<ssssss>we also schedule time on the tennis court and have a good time hit some ball around - the guy tend the court be extremely friendly.i have wait too long to remember all of the detail of we dinner fiasco -lrb- plural -rrb- , but the gist of it be that we call on we first evening to change we reservation for the follow day and be confirm .<ssssss>that day we be suppose to receive a reservation voucher to bring to the restaurant - by the time we get back to we room that evening , it be nowhere to be find .<ssssss>we call to complain and be tell they do not have any record of we reservation -lrb- neither we original one nor the new one -rrb- .<ssssss>we trek over to the royal service area to complain and , lo and behold , be meet with blank stare again .<ssssss>the worst thing be that the staff do not apologize and try to make thing right , they just get defensive .<ssssss>the only thing we ever hear from they be we have no reservation for you - you have to reserve in advance , you can not just call right before .<ssssss>even that would have be ok , if they have just preface it with a i be sorry , but that be something we do not hear the entire time we be there .<ssssss>i be a pretty nice guy - my fiancee make fun of I because i do not complain and i overtip even for bad service .<ssssss>perhaps i be not forceful enough , but i have to say that on the day we check out the guy at the next desk be virtually scream at they -lrb- after a half hour of fairly calm argue -rrb- and get basically the same reaction i get with my calm explanation that they have screw up .<ssssss>finally , as a consolation prize , they give we a 6-ish reservation for the restaurant -lrb- the japanese place -rrb- for the follow night , and we clearly only get that because someone else have cancel - still no apology .<ssssss>all that say , we should have avoid the finer dining place altogether .<ssssss>the japanese place , as i be sure other have note , be a benihana style joint that be basically fry rice and teriyaki .<ssssss>i be a pretty huge sushi fan , but i have to say that you should stay far away from the terrible sushi - if you have ever have sushi before , it will be upset - if you have never have sushi before -lrb- as many at we table have not -rrb- , it will make you wonder what kind of lunatic would ever eat the stuff .<ssssss>we cancel we reservation at the french place , as we hear pretty terrible thing about that as well .<ssssss>my suggestion for food be to stick with the latin theme place - the mexican and brazilian joint be both perfectly good and exactly what we expect .<ssssss>no surprise and a better selection.the bar near the royal service pool be lovely at night - softly light , not crowd but full enough to have a nice hum about the place and lot of laughter .<ssssss>the casino be a little depressing - bright fluorescent light and a few table , each with a couple of people who be a little too serious about they gambling consider the setting.we only go to one entertainment event , in the restaurant area/indoor bar down by the beach .<ssssss>it be a little odd to say the least .<ssssss>it be kind of a rave atmosphere - i can not remember what the theme be - but it have a sort of depraved thing go on .<ssssss>there be female go-go dancer type on raise platform and a oil and well-muscled man in nothing but a speedo , roller skate and sunglass roller-dance through the joint and grab delighted middle-aged woman to dance with .<ssssss>the strangest thing be that there be all these kid there , range from 10 to maybe 16 year old - people have bring they family down for a little entertainment , and the kid be dance around in strobe light next to these grind , provocatively dress staff member .<ssssss>think back to when i be 13 or 14 , i probably would have think it be pretty awesome to dance around with a bunch of hot , scantily clad dominican woman , but at 30 -lrb- which be pretty young as adult at that place go -rrb- this be just surreal and disturbing .<ssssss>clearly there be parent there - some be dance with they kid .<ssssss>i will confess i have fun just watch the strange scene , and i be sure many of the more traditional show with musical number , etc. be more appropriate for the family and senior who be the majority of the guests.finally , we check out -lrb- we stay 3 night -rrb- .<ssssss>we ask to have we bag bring around and to close out we bill .<ssssss>here we come back to that matter of the safe lock .<ssssss>i leave the lock attach to the safe with the key in it and the safe open - the other lock and key i place inside the safe .<ssssss>as we be wait for we luggage at the front of the resort , i be tell that they can not check I out because there be still a charge on we tab that need to be take care of .<ssssss>i ask what the problem be , and they say that i leave the safe lock in my room and i need to confirm that i have take everything out of the safe and retrieve the lock , then sign a release .<ssssss>if i do not , , they will have to remove the lock -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>and charge I for both lock -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i tell they that i take everything ouf ot the safe , leave it open intentionally , and leave the key there .<ssssss>they be welcome to take the lock , and i will sign the release , but i will not pay they for the lock , as they have it and the key .<ssssss>the head of security be page and , after a 20 minute wait , tell I that be not good enough .<ssssss>i have to go back to the room and confirm that there be nothing left .<ssssss>after argue about it and agree again to sign the release , i be tell its not enough - i be a lawyer , and while i be not fluent in spanish or dr law , the release have a english translation and unless dr law be crazy , the release would have completely cover they for liability if i leave something behind .<ssssss>finally , i agree to go to the room , i get on the back of the security chief 's scooter , schlep all the way to the room , look at the safe , take out the lock and hand it to the security chief , sign the release , and schlep back to my wait fiancee .<ssssss>thank god we plan to get to the airport very early , because this would potentially have make we miss we flight if we have let if get much closer.so , if you have read this far , you be probably ask how i can even give the place two star .<ssssss>answer ?<ssssss>if i know what it be go in , i probably would not have find the experience so frustrating .<ssssss>you need to go there expect very little and you will probably come away with a much better experience , both objectively and subjectively .<ssssss>plan to go and sit on the beach or by the pool , eat mexican or dominican food , and try not to rely on the property to do anything for you .<ssssss>if you can do that and get a good deal on price , it will be fine .<ssssss>the setting be lovely , the people be -lrb- for the most part -rrb- friendly , and there be free food and drink .<ssssss>good enough , i would say .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 3 1 2 -1		sketch the hotel be in a good location - roughly 45 minute from the old airport but very close to tianamen square and the forbid city -lrb- 15 minute walk -rrb- and the temple of heaven.the hadimen hotel -lrb- just behind the hotel -rrb- be home to a great restaurant if you want peking duck.the hotel 's concierge desk will help you arrange tour if you want to visit the great wall of china and the ming tombs.the onsite cafe have very poor service -lrb- slow and very unattentive -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be sort of small and musty smell .<ssssss>the blowdrier be hide in the desk drawer and can not be unplugged and move to the bathroom or any other outlet which can be annoying since the lighting be very poor in the room.the executive lounge be very small and do not offer any type of nutritious item save some old fruit .<ssssss>the staff do not speak very good english which be quite disappointing consider that the 2008 summer olympics will be hold in this city .<ssssss>the front desk staff be not even aware that there be two airport operate in the city .<ssssss>there be only one helpful person who be able to provide we with fairly accurate help and direction in the entire hotel.the staff be quite snotty and slow and do not pay attention to detail -lrb- i have to request the correct room key and type of room several time - even though i have a email confirmation regard my selection -rrb- .<ssssss>the room safe do not work yet all the housekeeping staff appear to have a dummy code to reset it - so be warn to have a backup plan for any valuable you may be carry with you.overall , the location make up for the poor customer service and lack of ambiance .<ssssss>
4 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		do not believe disgruntled reviewer - glory be ok i ' m sorry about the experience of the april 2006 reviewer but we have just return from the hotel glory and enjoy we stay .<ssssss>the staff be all friendly but they english be a bit sketchy so it help that i speak spanish .<ssssss>perhaps poor english on both side be the cause of the problem for the previous reviewer .<ssssss>we room be not huge but be pleasant and very quiet consider we be face the street , -lrb- barcelona can be very noisy -rrb- .<ssssss>the air conditioning work well and the breakfast choice be excellent .<ssssss>one morning we want to leave early before breakfast start so we ask if we could have room service .<ssssss>this be not available , but they offer to prepare picnic which we could collect from reception at 6am .<ssssss>when we check out of the hotel we notice that the picnic be not on the bill .<ssssss>we query this and be tell that there be no charge as we have not take breakfast on that day .<ssssss>quite fair really , but not the norm in many hotel .<ssssss>approach via monumental metro station .<ssssss>it be closer .<ssssss>enjoy you stay .<ssssss>

3 5 4 4 3 2 3 -1		great value for money i book this motel first and then think to look it up on this site ... therefore i be quite apprehensive due to the mixed review ... the place be easy to find , reception be dull and lifeless , reception staff be not exactly unfriendly but certainly lack welcome and helpful attitude , we be not give any map or offer about tour etc.parking be very tight and limited but free of charge , suggest you arrive early.the room itself be clean -lrb- if you can overlook the toenail clipping i find on my bedspread ... gulp -rrb- and newly renovate with all amenity one could wish for but very noisy from the room above.the outstanding location and price be great value for money and i choose to come back for another night a few day later .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 3 1 2 1		a place to just , relax ... well not quite .<ssssss>my boy 's and i have the chance to visit the dr this past winter during they spring break .<ssssss>after read some review here , and talk to some friend , we decide to visit paradisus .<ssssss>the hotel be about 30min from the airport and on the southern coast .<ssssss>it be situate in a very lush tropical setting and the grounds be beautiful.we arrive around 6pm and wait over a hour to check into the hotel .<ssssss>while there seem to be plenty of hotel staff , they be really not focus on take care of the guest as they arrived.after a lot of confusion we be take to the family conceirge to check in , and they too be a bit confused and unorganized .<ssssss>eventually , we be give we room but the confusion do not stop there .<ssssss>one of the room be occupy by another guest , who be suprise to see 3 boy appear at they door at 900p !!<ssssss>we move into one room , while the conceirge go to figure out where the other room be .<ssssss>about a hour later they find a room to use for one night in another part of the hotel .<ssssss>it be almost 1030p before this be ever resolve .<ssssss>the next day we have to move to another set of room that be adjacent to each other .<ssssss>we have a all inclusive meal plan which be very convenient for all of we .<ssssss>the downside be that you be pretty much lock into eat within set time , and there be no late night place to get a snack or late dinner .<ssssss>the restaraunt be not the resort strong point , in fact they be all fairly average , the one exception be the one that be on the beach and open for lunch - this one have a pretty good buffet in a nice setting on the beach .<ssssss>the pool be very nice , but you need to claim you spot early in the morning to be assure be close to the pool .<ssssss>the beach be also very nice , good surf , nice wide beach .<ssssss>this too require a little advance scout to claim chaise etc in the early am.if sleep on the beach/pool and completely relax due to a lack of activity be not you thing .<ssssss>you will need to get off the property .<ssssss>the lobby have quite a few service gear toward scuba diving , snorkle with shark -lrb- more of a booze cruise -rrb- , atv 's etc i use the gym , it be very small for a resort of this size , but if you hit it at the right time you have the place to yourself.for we it be nice to get away and spend time together , but i would not return to paradisus .<ssssss>the restaurant need to improve , the room decor could use a update/refreshening and the hotel staff be just a bit to unorganized for my taste .<ssssss>
3 1 4 -1 4 -1 4 -1		do not understand the big deal i stay at the zaza while in dallas on business .<ssssss>i read the review that state it be cool , hip , and the place to be .<ssssss>while the hotel be very trendy and the room be very nice , i leave wonder what all the fuss be about .<ssssss>i pay roughly $ 320 a night for a roomâ€ $ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>in dallasâ€ n a monday night !<ssssss>i expect to pay top dollar in city like new york , dc , chicago , etc. but if iâ€™m pay $ 300 + for a room in dalla it better have more to offer than funky light fixture and a overprice restaurant .<ssssss>hope this be helpful .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 4 1 3 4		great hotel , desk need help we enjoy one of the room that face the arc , i think that speak for itself .<ssssss>everytime you come into the room , open up the baclony window and ... wow .<ssssss>the room be great , the bathroom be spacious and clean .<ssssss>everything be good and very french.the hotel desk and concierge could use some help though .<ssssss>i know the french be a little reserved , but c'mon .<ssssss>i do not think the level of effort to pry the information out , or the quality of that information be a cultural or language thing .<ssssss>it be simply a useless effort to continue try , so we go about it on we own and we be better for it.all in all the view more than make up for some of the shortcoming ... go ahead and book it , just do you research ahead of time .<ssssss>
4 -1 3 5 5 4 3 -1		great location - bit shabby thanks to previous reviewer i have a good idea what to expect and therefore be very satisfied with the dikker.it be a brilliant location for sightseeing if you want more than just the red light and coffee shop .<ssssss>tram 2 and 5 from centraal stop right outside and it be a two minute walk to leidersplein for other tramline and all the restaurant you can possibly need .<ssssss>the red light etc be about a 20 min walk back into town but as that be through all the main shopping area it be a nice walk.the hotel itself be a bit shabby - we reject we first room -lrb- 308 -rrb- as it be almost underground and only have two small window near the ceiling .<ssssss>the staff be fine about it and we transfer to room 205 in the older part of the hotel which have a great big bay window overlook the canal and the street which make for great people watch .<ssssss>the room be spotlessly clean but well live in !<ssssss>the sink be not in the bathroom but on a partition wall in the room .<ssssss>this be not a problem to we but may be to other .<ssssss>breakfast be fab - a cold buffet that be constantly replenish right up to the end of the breakfast period and it be include in the price.there be a bit of noise from other guest - the wall be a bit thin !<ssssss>but nothing that cause a problem .<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 4 1 3 -1		great hotel , shame about the receptionist i stay at this hotel with a group of friend on june , and can not really fault the hotel itself .<ssssss>room be lovely , very comfortable , good shower/bathroom .<ssssss>the rooftop be really nice , with a pool around the exterior .<ssssss>this be only small but be sufficient .<ssssss>there be not really enough lounger though and people often end up lay on towel on the floor .<ssssss>it would also really benefit from a bar/snack area up there .<ssssss>you can get round this by order room service up to the roof -lrb- there be a phone up there -rrb- .<ssssss>the only real gripe i have be the receptionist .<ssssss>we arrive at the hotel just after check in time , only to be tell we room be not ready - we would book 4 room , none be availiable .<ssssss>we be ask to come back in a hour - no problem , we go and have a wander round and get some food .<ssssss>come back a hour and half later only to be tell we room still be not ready !<ssssss>the annoying thing be the reception staff could not seem to care less and offer no apology whatsoever !<ssssss>i do not think they have any ounce of customer service at all!this aside , the rest of we stay be very good , and the hotel itself be great .<ssssss>just a shame about the service ...<ssssss>

3 4 5 4 5 2 4 -1		overbooked !!<ssssss>let I start by thank all past guest at this resort for they valuable comment and feedback which , after much research , convinced I to pick this resort for my family vacation.after all that i read about the gran bahia principe bavaro , i never expect to be prepare for what be wait for we at check-in .<ssssss>apparently the resort overbook they available capacity for the punta cana and bavaro section of the resort , which lead to some inconvenience during we stay.check-in : upon arrival , 12:30 pm sunday june 22 , room have be oversell and check-in staff have trouble find a room with two double bed -lrb- we be a family of 4 , 2 adult , 2 child -rrb- .<ssssss>the only room available be with one king size bed !<ssssss>check-in finally freed-up a room at 15:30 with 2 double beds.a la carte restaurant : during the time wait for we room to be ready we decide to book we three a la carte restaurant at customer service .<ssssss>due to the large number of guest , only one restaurant be available !<ssssss>customer service advise that we should check-in with they every morning at 8:00 be for cancellation .<ssssss>well come tuesday , no cancellation , and my wife decide to take a more direct approach with customer service .<ssssss>speak fluent spanish , she explain that on the monday evening , we decide to check out some restaurant directly and discover that the french restaurant cafe de paris -lrb- on the bavaro side of the resort -rrb- and the japanese mikado -lrb- on the punta cana side -rrb- be close !!<ssssss>customer service now admit that those two restaurant be just close this week and that suddenly there be a cancellation at the dominican restaurant located in the club premier section of the resort !<ssssss>we never succede in get a third a la carte restaurant and i believe the resort be limit the amount of people in the restaurant as a measure of cost control .<ssssss>send everyone to the buffet be much more profitable for them.the quality of food at the two a la carte 's be very good compare to the buffet.buffet : turn out we 2 a la carte be book for the last two evening of we stay so the buffet be we feeding grounds for the first 5 dinner .<ssssss>food be average , i would rate it a 6 on 10 , with mexico 's grand occidental xcaret surpass the gbp by far.bars : popular tropical drink -lrb- pina colada 's coco loco 's -rrb- be premix from large commercial drink mixer and taste very artificial .<ssssss>ask the bartender for a drink that he have to prepare , like a strawberry daiquiri or margarita , and he will give you a dirty look !<ssssss>suffice it to say that i stick with lot of cerveza 's -lrb- which be not they local presidente by the way but more of a water down draft beer -rrb- and cuba libre 's while my spanish speaking wife keep ask for the daiquiri 's and margarita 's .<ssssss>oversold situatiion : here 's how the resort decide to handle the large number of guest book during this week -lrb- june 22-29 -rrb- .<ssssss>early monday morning , a flyer be distribute to every room in the resort ask guest if they would be interested in a free excursion to visit isla saona , altos de chavon , stay at the gran bahia principe la samana for one night , get a free upgrade to club diamond -lrb- adult only -rrb- or hacienda -lrb- with child -rrb- , and get a free security box on the condition that they pack and leave they room for one night .<ssssss>the excursion would begin friday 6:30 be and guest be to return saturday 6:00 pm .<ssssss>room have to be vacate and luggage would be store in a special lock luggage room for the duration of the excursion .<ssssss>the value of the excursion be approximately $ 100 per person and the objective be to get people off the site in order to accomodate other guest .<ssssss>these flyer be everywhere , underneath glass table top , at the bar , post on large billboard outside the buffet restaurant , on check-in counter ... you could not miss them.on friday afternoon , a group of approximately 300 guest , all employee of shell oil , arrive and take over the pool and beach area .<ssssss>saturday 's regularly schedule beach activity -lrb- morning yoga session , dance lesson -rrb- and afternoon pool aerobics , bingo game , and poolside dance lesson be cancel because all the animator be entertain the shell oil guest , party on the beach .<ssssss>on saturday , the beach and main pool be jam with people.water sport : could not get a booking for a free one hour ride on a catamaran the whole week because of two reason .<ssssss>one , only three of the six catamaran be operational , three be break , and two , too many guest .<ssssss>well , 10 minute later , here come my spanish speaking wife again and this time she ask for a one hour lesson at $ 30 and guess what , suddenly a catamaran be available for that lesson and it would be on the water in 5 minute !<ssssss>be this another example of limit what be really free to guest so that they could sell a lesson?lounge chair at beach and pool : forget about try to find a lounge chair at the beach or the main pool at 8:30 be on monday because of , you guess it , too many guest .<ssssss>here 's another unique trick ... guest be arrive at the pool and beach early morning and instead of reserve a lounge chair by place one towel lengthwise per chair , they be actually place they towel across two chair , widthwise , thereby reserve twice the number of chair at the beach and at the pool.guess what we start do early tuesday be !<ssssss>status at other resort : during the week , my wife and i walk up and down the beach to check out other resort .<ssssss>the majestic -lrb- 5 * -rrb- , just north of gbp , have 50 % of the lounge chair available at the beach and next to they pool .<ssssss>the riu , just south of the gbp , have maybe 40 % of lounge chair free and the resort look much larger than the gbp , in term of surface area on the beach .<ssssss>much fewer bather be spot at these reort compare to the cram pool and beach of the gbp.overall , the grounds be impeccably clean , every morning the beach be clean of the thousand of cigarette butt and plastic drinking glass leave behind by late night beachgoer , the room be very clean , the pool clean be beautiful , and the staff do they best give the many guest on site.if it be not for those few inconvenience and all those people , this trip would have be much more relaxing and would have rank right up there .<ssssss>i guess this be a situation where bigger be not necessarily better !!<ssssss>

5 5 5 4 5 5 5 2		very nice stay i should preface this by note that we use reward point to pay for we stay , so the only cost to we be the parking.we choose the fairmont because it be part of we point package and it be within walk distance to the wang theatre -lrb- about 15-20 minute -rrb- .<ssssss>as well , they also welcome we dog.the valet and doorman be nice and friendly when we drive up .<ssssss>and we be very pleasantly surprise with a upgrade to a king suite when we check in , so the visit get off to a great start .<ssssss>it be pretty busy in the hotel at the time - look like there be some sort of seminar or something go on - so it take a while for the few bag we have to make it upstairs.the room be excellent !<ssssss>the bathroom be very spacious - two smaller room -lrb- toilet/bidet/large shower stall in one and vanity and large tub in the other -rrb- - and the rest of the room be very large -lrb- spacious enough for the king bed , a couple of bedside table , the armoire , a couch , a bench at the end of the bed , a coffee table - you get the picture -rrb- .<ssssss>i do check out the fitness center - it be small , but seem to have the basics - 2 or 3 treadmill , a couple of eliptical machine , a good stack of weight , as well as a universal .<ssssss>the equipment look pretty new .<ssssss>it appear to be very clean and well-maintained - just as the rest of the hotel appear to be.we be in and out of the hotel and the staff be always very friendly/helpful the few time we have question .<ssssss>we only complaint be that the shower stall end up leak water profusely on the floor - i feel bad about it and we clean it up as best we could and leave the towel in the tub.according to we bill , the hotel would have cost $ 260/night , which consider it be a four star , nicely located , and the room be actually a suite , probably be not too bad .<ssssss>-lrb- we will be stay at the onyx soon , which will cost we more . -rrb-<ssssss>money permit , i would not hesitate to stay here again !<ssssss>

3 3 3 4 5 5 5 -1		almost above average overall , but you need to be quiet in you own room this be my first time in oahu , and i be very picky when it come to choose hotel .<ssssss>my husband choose the outrigger in waikiki for I because i be go crazy try to choose a hotel .<ssssss>when i look at the picture of the room on the internet , i be not very impressed , it look very dull .<ssssss>but it be a great deal , so we -lrb- actually mu husband -rrb- go for it.when we arrive at the hotel , the valet attendant be very friendly and courteous .<ssssss>the front desk be also very friendly .<ssssss>the lobby be very beautiful .<ssssss>we be actually upgrade to a partial oceanview room -lrb- originally pay for a city view -rrb- on the opposite side of the cheesecake factory , -lrb- which be suppose to be quieter -rrb- .<ssssss>the view be more than what i expect .<ssssss>and the room be actually pretty comfortable and cozy than i have think .<ssssss>the room be renovate , and the bathroom have granite countertop , also renovate , tub be actually a half tub/shower , but work for we , large closet space .<ssssss>feel very clean.the room be not sound proof , though , with the a/c off , you could still hear street and sound from the outside .<ssssss>and we even have a bad experience : the wall be very thin .<ssssss>my kid wake up about 4am in the morning and be awake , play , and laughing , and the people from the room next to we bang on the wall because they could hear we .<ssssss>the front desk call we to keep it down .<ssssss>after that incident , we have to consciously keep tell the child to keep quiet and sometimes not to talk at all .<ssssss>they do not have a good time.this hotel be not a good idea if you have kid , especially if you have some that wake up during the night .<ssssss>but overall , it be in a great location near shopping , the waikiki beach and across from the international marketplace .<ssssss>my only complaint be the thin wall and it can be very noisy even with all the door close ... if you like the action , stay here , as long as you do not mind the noise and thin wall .<ssssss>next time though , we will probably stay somewhere else ...<ssssss>

4 -1 2 2 5 4 4 -1		hip , trendy place with youthful appeal my taste in hotel be eclectic .<ssssss>while i most prefer small place of charm and character like villa rosario where we stay in ribadesella , i also like larger place of strip down asceticism like monumento san francisco in compostelo , and even utilitarian place like vincci puerto chico where we stay in santander , all on we recent trip to northern spain .<ssssss>and i even like super modern , trendy , hip and youthfulâ€”which be what this place be .<ssssss>itâ€™s a member of the room mate chain which originate in spain and have expand rapidly include one of they newest , grace , in nyc , and another , waldorf tower in south beach , miami .<ssssss>madrid have four of they , though at the rate theyâ€™re expand it may be more by the time i post this .<ssssss>the magazine they leave in the room say they be build 25 more in the next year .<ssssss>laura be locate up a hill slightly behind the opera house and itâ€™s the location thatâ€™s the most off put of any aspect of the place .<ssssss>the surroundings seem dodgy and theyâ€™re certainly not attractive , and not very cleanâ€”of course , neither be a lot of madrid as i learn from a sunday morning after experience in the stinky puerto del sol .<ssssss>otherwise , itâ€™s a pretty interesting place .<ssssss>you enter up a flight of stair and most everything be orangeâ€”my favorite color .<ssssss>whatâ€™s not orange be either black or white .<ssssss>the furnishings donâ€™t appear select to last but theyâ€™re interesting while they remain around .<ssssss>we room be a two story affair , with couch and table and chair plus main bathroom/shower downstairs and bed with -lrb- thankfully -rrb- a second mini-bathroom upstairs .<ssssss>even the stair themselves be interesting .<ssssss>each be a half step , alternate the place where you must put you foot from the leave to the rightâ€”not good for a person like myself with problem ankle and knee who most often ascend , and especially descend , one step at a time , place both foot on the same riser at once .<ssssss>i tell you , didnâ€™t i that this be a trendy , youthful kind of place .<ssssss>oldy take note .<ssssss>iâ€™m pleased to say i survive all this without mishap , but i admit iâ€™d not knowingly book similar dig again , even for the flaming orange accent .<ssssss>the headboard for the bed be actually the wall itself , cut back in concentric rectangle with a orange light picture of queen elizabethâ€”the first .<ssssss>no clue what that be all about , but it be arrest .<ssssss>what i didnâ€™t like be that this loft bed , be by virtue of the small amount of space available , push next to the wall cause I to have to shimmy in and out of bed if i didnâ€™t want to wake my husband to let I out like a regular person .<ssssss>bathroom follow the white minimalist formulaic pattern with stainless steel small vanity and black bubble floor that can be lay of a piece .<ssssss>i suppose you have to do something simply if youâ€™re go to erect 25 new minimalist place in the next year in part unknown .<ssssss>the breakfast room and the breakfast be very nice with more pix of qe1 , orange , black and white dÃ©cor , chilewich placemat and all the standard offering , all of which be include in the standard room rate which turn out to average 155 euro per night , though higher one night and lower the next .<ssssss>truly not a bad rate for a clean , interesting hotel in the center of a major city .<ssssss>iâ€™d not return , but that have more to do with I than the hotel .<ssssss>for young , hip , agile under 50 something , iâ€™d say itâ€™s a pretty good deal .<ssssss>but iâ€™d investigate the madrid location of the other member of the chain before book this one .<ssssss>it may be that the other be in better neighborhood and still afford the same trendy vibe .<ssssss>see for yourself at www.room-matehotels.com .<ssssss>

4 5 3 5 4 5 4 3		good value this be a conveniently situate hotel - very close to the station the market , and within easy walk distance to the duomo other attraction .<ssssss>whilst the room be not big , and the bathroom be cramped , they be clean and appear to have be reburbish fairly recently .<ssssss>there be a safe a reasonably price mini bar , but it would be quicker to stick you head out of the windown than use the hairdryer provide !<ssssss>breakfast be vary with fruit , cheese , bread cake but you can order fried egg , omlette etc if you want to pay extra .<ssssss>we do not need to use the heating or the air conditioning so not sure what it would be like in the bedroom in the height of summer or if it be really cold .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly helpful .<ssssss>as we only pay Â£40 per night include breakfast for a double room i think that this be excellent value for money would stay there again .<ssssss>
3 5 5 5 4 4 3 3		nice visit .<ssssss>good location if south of market be where you want to be .<ssssss>walk distance to moscone conv ctr and some nice restaurant .<ssssss>right next door to cnet headquarters and close to jpmorgan chase .<ssssss>
4 3 4 4 3 4 4 1		beautiful view , but at a cost !<ssssss>get a great deal through hotwire.com on this place - nice deluxe room , which be comfortable and impressive - equally impressive be the 2 inch roach inside the hotel guide which rather shatter the first impression of luxury .<ssssss>again , beautiful view from the room but everything be very expensive - breakfast $ 25 per person per day , internet and parking , similar fee .<ssssss>the private island be a novelty , but by the time you ride the tram down to the dock and the boat to the island , the novelty wear off .<ssssss>bottom line - glad we go there , glad to have see the view , glad we have a rental car to escape to town where we could afford to eat , glad we only stay a couple of day .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 3 -1		avoid at all cost we book this hotel follow all the wonderful review that we have see place on trip advisor .<ssssss>after a 12hr flight from new zealand we look forward to book in.staff on the front desk where very helpful when check in and give we the key to we room.upon arrive at the front door we want to leave , the carpet be filthy , plaster be peal off the wall and when we open the door we could have cried.the room be terrible .<ssssss>the furniture look extremely date and the shower area be disgusting .<ssssss>all we want to do be get some sleep but in all honesty we couldnâ€™t have sleep give the conditions.went down to the front desk and ask if we could change room , the new room be even worse .<ssssss>with this in mind we check out and book into the marriot across the road.this be a real let down give all the great review that have be write previously.in all honesty this be the worst hotel that we have ever stay in -lrb- albeit very short -rrb-<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 3 5 4 3		nice location , but a bit pricey we stay here the first week of september , 2007 .<ssssss>great location , yes , but a bit pricey .<ssssss>we have a deluxe room , corner suite , with nice view of the sound .<ssssss>however , at $ 300 + per night , a bit pricey !<ssssss>although the room be nice size , certainly not what we would expect for a suite , with no designate sit area .<ssssss>the room be , in fact , a bit cramped for they largest room size .<ssssss>also , although the view be good , it look out over the roof before you have a view of puget sound .<ssssss>great location , convenient to the market , etc. , but a bit too pricey .<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 4 1 1 4		terrible behaviour , good breakfast the hotel as such be good with a very good breakfast .<ssssss>i stay here along with a friend for more than 20 day and the behaviour of the guy at the reception be terrible .<ssssss>as a instance , i go to ask he about reservation and he say we will talk tomorrow morning , thanks you without even look at I .<ssssss>the room be small and there be no place to move but i guess it be ok for the price .<ssssss>connectivity from the hotel to all important place be good as it be right in front of the main station .<ssssss>
2 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		honeymoon not what we expect !!<ssssss>we book the dominican think it would make we honeymoon very special - how wrong could we be.the ocean bavaro hotel in itself be very nice and the room where good and the cleaning lady wonderful but that be where it ends.the rest of the hotel staff , from management to bar staff could not care less about you unless you speak fluent spanish!the food be not that good and so even though we go all inclusive we end up spend more money on food in the attach resturant as that be the only place you could get a decent evening meal.all in all the honeymoon for we be only make special by the english people we meet who where great.i do not recommend bavaro ocean resort .<ssssss>
5 5 2 5 5 5 4 4		exelente hotel .<ssssss>playa el hotel<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 4 2 1		fantastic location , nice hotel but overprice .<ssssss>we stay here form 5 night from the 18th to the 23rd of august , and i have to say , the location canâ€™t be beat : - right on copley square with newbury street a block away , next to the green line â€œTâ€ ?<ssssss>and downtown a few block away to the east .<ssssss>the prudential mall be 5 minute away , and the common the same in the opposite direction .<ssssss>also on the positive , the room be pleasant , clean and relatively spacious , and it be a very comfortable stay -lrb- the bed be fantastic -rrb- .<ssssss>the staff be pleasant , and the air-con be more than adequate .<ssssss>the room -lrb- ours be on the 6th floor -rrb- have a large closet space , which mean you room didnâ€™t need to be clutter with case , and contain a safe box and iron/ironing-board .<ssssss>right , the bad news : the room have a extensive supply of outrageously overpriced minibar item , but no coffee or tea facility , which be a bit of a pain .<ssssss>a bottle of water in the room be $ 8â€ ?<ssssss>bring new meaning to the term â€œprecious waterâ€ ?<ssssss>the cost of internet access be $ 14 a day , which be exuberant give internet access in a lot of hotel be free .<ssssss>if you be stay on the gold level -lrb- 4th floor -rrb- there be free wifus , which we could access in we room and can be pick up in other area of the hotel .<ssssss>room service be a joke .<ssssss>we have to ring three time to get a order put through , and while the cost on the menu wasnâ€™t too different that other hotel in this range , the extra cost add on be ridiculousâ€ ?<ssssss>on top of the menu price there be a 18 % gratuity -lrb- which when force on you isnâ€™t really a gratuity at all , now be it ? -rrb-<ssssss>, $ 5 delivery charge -lrb- so whatâ€™s the 18 % for ? -rrb-<ssssss>and tax .<ssssss>this mean we end up pay nearly 35 % more for the room service than the menu price indicate .<ssssss>fair enough , they tell you this on the menu , but it doesnâ€™t make the excess any more palatable .<ssssss>naturally , we decide against room service other night , and instead settle for stock up on snack from the 7-eleven and cv across the square.the hotel itself be quite impressive , the lobby and reception area be more like a grand imperial hotel in europe , and for location alone , i would probably stay here again , but my expectation would be a lot less , and room service would be off the list .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 3 3 -1		awesome value we have be to nola 3 time now , once pre-katirna and twice post .<ssssss>we have stay at the bw french quarter and the w french quarter besides this hotel , just so you get context .<ssssss>we travel a fair bit .<ssssss>this be by far the best bang-for-buck hotel we have ever stay in anywhere .<ssssss>we pay less than $ 100/night for 2 night .<ssssss>the room be first rate , with 12 foot ceiling .<ssssss>the rooftop pool be perfect with great view of the city - the hot-tub be a great place to smoke a stogie and -lrb- i be careful -rrb- and the pool be well heated - vital for my 6 year old .<ssssss>the location be ideal as well as we be just a couple of block from the french quarter and near many excellent restaurant , as well my son and i walk to the d-day museum and the children museum from here and it take 10 minute top .<ssssss>however the best aspect of the hotel be the hot breakfast in the morning and the 3 drink each in the evening .<ssssss>the breakfast be not fancy -lrb- scramble egg etc -rrb- but it be just how i like it , and no wait or tip -lrb- i do tip a buck a drink but not as much as i would wait staff -rrb- .<ssssss>we spend we last night in nola at the w french quarter , very shishi , but i guess i care more about value than beautiful courtyard -lrb- how much time you gon na spend there anyway ? -rrb-<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 2 4 3 -1		great location this hotel have a great location , right in the heart of time square , and across the road from the port authority -lrb- bus and train service -rrb- .<ssssss>it be surround by dozen of eat place and the usual touristy shop .<ssssss>check in be smooth and fast , as i arrive in the evening .<ssssss>i be give access to the executive lounge , which be nice -lrb- continental breakfast of boil egg , fruit , cereal , toast and pastry -rrb- cocktail time cheese and cracker , antipasto platter and usually two hot hors d'oeuvre - wine be available as well.the room be relatively small , with superb westin comfort bed and lcd tv .<ssssss>the bathroom be small as well , but adequate .<ssssss>find the amenity to be rather frugal this time around - very limited and i have to call down and ask for a shower cap , cotton ball etc. also have to ask to have the free coffee and tea replenish as this be not do .<ssssss>the room cleanliness be so/so - bit of paper and tissue leave on the carpet , and in the bathroom until we complain about that .<ssssss>seem like they do not vacuum every day!overall , this be a good hotel and we would most definitely return -<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 1 5 2 -1		not up to standard for a marriott the jw marriott be not at all up to the standard i have always find at marriott at all level .<ssssss>1 .<ssssss>a wad of hair be on the bathroom floor .2 .<ssssss>mm stick on the table under the memo pad .3 .<ssssss>a makeup bag under the drape leave by a prior guest .4 .<ssssss>a badly broken bathroom glass towel that be rough and not very white .5 .<ssssss>coffee serve in the bar with the saucer full of slop coffee and a attitude when the bar only have 3 other patron and they have drink already .<ssssss>6 .<ssssss>after put on the butler button for ice i wait 30 minute before call the desk to send up ice .7 .<ssssss>i have to request cereal bowl and ceral spoon for breakfast and cheese be serve without cracker .8 .<ssssss>the hotel charge 12 a day for wifus and it be free at the less expensive marriott brands.the front desk and conceriage be terrific as be the man who maan the front door .<ssssss>i would suggest you spend you money else where when in san francisco .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 -1 -1		nice hotel overall it be a nice stay .<ssssss>i really only have one small complaint .<ssssss>i get a great deal on priceline and would definitely stay again if i could get a good deal.pros : room be plenty big enough , air conditioner work fine and offer range of temp , bed be comfortable and the curtain let the room get pretty dark .<ssssss>we have a high floor so noise be not really a issue .<ssssss>elevator be fast and you never have to wait for more than a couple seconds for one to come .<ssssss>plenty of cab outside and subway right across the street .<ssssss>bathroom be very big and roomy .<ssssss>nice soft towel and lot of counter space .<ssssss>i do not need internet access while i be there so i do not know how that service be but my cell phone reception be great throughout the hotel .<ssssss>i do not use the fitness center - i run on the street while i be there and i run alone and feel completely safe .<ssssss>i also do not eat at the hotel so i can not comment on the food.cons : checkin be a little slow - they only have 2 people behind the desk and i will never understand why hotel do not put up a queue line .<ssssss>although there be a informal line of people wait to check in , some rude guest be just walkin in and go right up to the counter in front of everyone who be wait .<ssssss>they really need to get they check in process straighten out !<ssssss>other than this one little complaint , i would recommend this hotel to other .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 2 1 4		avoid this one like the plague i attend a conference in boston for a week in oct 07 and book this hotel on the internet after search all hotel online in the vicinity of the conference centre to no avail - unless i could have afford $ 650 per night which be all that be leave !<ssssss>-lrb- onference be at the sheraton hotel , and all they room be book out -rrb- .<ssssss>the milnerâ€™s description and photo make it sound ok - and it be convenient enough ... but ... in reality it be a filthy hovel .<ssssss>i feel i should report to health department .<ssssss>it be a disgusting place and nobody there seem to care about it â€?except the handyman !<ssssss>for ` quaint ' read ` fall apart ' .<ssssss>service be apathetic at the best of time although there be one young guy who be helpful .<ssssss>my room describe as double room with desk and private bathroom be small , shabby , run down and dirty .<ssssss>the curtain be crappy and do not meet in the middle so i be potentially overlook -lrb- in bed -rrb- from across the road when the light be on .<ssssss>the shower tray be crack and hold together by tape ; there be no door between the toilet and bedroom , and the washbasin be in a separate corner of the room .<ssssss>there be a huge stain area of ceiling tile in the washbasin corner from a old water leak .<ssssss>no wardrobe but a hang space with rail and 3 plastic hanger in the room .<ssssss>nowhere to store luggage .<ssssss>the only good point be free internet access.the handyman tell I that the hotel be half refurbish -lrb- 5th floor be apparently more modern , avoid 3rd for sure !! -rrb-<ssssss>and the whole place need repair and refurbishment but management be not listen to what need doing.next morning i request a change of room , and be put in the suite on level 6 -lrb- lift stop at level 5 -rrb- so a walk up with luggage to the attic .<ssssss>this be bigger with a small desk - window blind have not be clean this century i reckon and the room reek of stale tobacco smoke .<ssssss>the carpet be dirty too , not sure when it would have last be vacuum , and the toilet need attention - water drip into the bowl continuously between flush .<ssssss>anyway i stick it out â€?itâ€™s a noisy place because the lift shaft be next to it so i get vibration through the pillow at time ... -lrb- apparently this be the manager 's suite when he be there so now i know he standard i can understand why this place be so run down ... -rrb- go to ` breakfast ' once â€?a tiny little dirty area off the main foyer - floor filthy and sticky , nobody to assist , table dirty , make you own waffle or find cereal , few yogurt and unappetising hard boil egg sit in a bowl on ice ... .<ssssss>make you own tea or coffee , use plastic cutlery -lrb- obviously recycle and stack in container unwrapped -rrb- , muffin , doughnut and bread in they plastic wrapper to help yourself to ... .<ssssss>feel sick at the sight of it so do not go back .<ssssss>tv be play all the time , some inane rubbishy show.thank goodness i be able to transfer out of this dreadful filthy place for my last night and stay at the sheraton in deluxe comfort for not much more than the milner charged.milner should be knock down ; it be overprice , filthy and unpleasant .<ssssss>if you want cheap accommodation try camping or a youth hostel , definitely do not come here ; if you want value for money then this place be a rip-off<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 1 4 1 -1		a little too small , a little too noisy so i bookedthe room through hotwire and you could say i get what i deserve , but usually hotwire get I one of those cute boutique hotel in the shopping district .<ssssss>this time i get a big , bland building full of glass and steel .<ssssss>the room be disappointingly small and not high enough up to avoid the street people scream and act crazy .<ssssss>the creepiest part be the dirty room service tray park right outside the room and the dirty hand towel on the rack above the toilet .<ssssss>my suspicion be that the staff think they only need to do turndown service and not a full room cleaning .<ssssss>so who know if the sheet be use ?<ssssss>beware of the $ 45 parking fee .<ssssss>i think nearby garage will charge less .<ssssss>if you be willing to hoof it , i would check thesutter/stockton or the 5th and mission garage .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 4 3 4 5		nice hotel , but no perfect when we arrive at this hotel , we stay for 5 night .<ssssss>the first night be a bit of a disaster , since they put we inside a smoking room , and could not accommodate a change .<ssssss>apparently , they be fully book , since do the same with many of my classmate on the trip .<ssssss>we be able to change room the following day , but this experience starkly contrast my wonderful experience with the granvia hotel in kyoto.the staff be friendly , to a degree , but i do not feel the hospitality i do when i be in kyoto .<ssssss>i guess the city folk in tokyo have become more and more like new york.the room be decent .<ssssss>the location be good , since it be right by the shinjuku station , where there be ton of shop and restaurants.the view , however , be phenomenal , span the whole city.the restaurant be decently good , but they be quite pricey.i have to admit , i really love they french/japanese restaurant .<ssssss>the view , food , and service be all top notched.overall , it be a convenient location , sufficiently friendly staff , and a beautiful hotel .<ssssss>

4 5 3 5 5 3 4 -1		exactly what i expect : a good thing !<ssssss>my husband and i attend a wedding in nyc and need a affordable hotel for three day .<ssssss>tripadvisor reviewer wisely recommend the chelsea lodge and my stay be just as good as i think i would be .<ssssss>these be some thing i know from read past post : the hotel be on a residential street with no sign outside , it be small , charming and a little cramped in the room , front desk service be spotty , room service be great and share toilet be not as weird as you think it might be .<ssssss>all of that be true .<ssssss>however here be some other thing that make we pleasantly surprise : while the front desk do not exactly go out of they way for thing , they certainly be nice to we -- we get direction , they take some picture for we , we get to check in a little early and they help we with we bag .<ssssss>what more do you need ?<ssssss>also , we be on the third floor face the street : with the window open , you get the usual nyc noise , but when we shut it , it be extremely quiet and no neighbor be loud at night , so we get great sleep .<ssssss>be on the third floor do mean have to climb 2 flight of stair , but if you be reasonably fit , it be not really a problem .<ssssss>in addition , even though the room be pretty small -lrb- and i agree with another poster -- not good for long stay unless you have light baggage -rrb- , we have a comfy bed , the shower and sink in the room work fine and the room definitely have a cuteness to it .<ssssss>in fact , the picture of the room on the website look exactly like ours .<ssssss>and share the toilet really be no big deal at all .<ssssss>they be both right across from we room and be always clean , fresh and i never have to wait once .<ssssss>in fact , i never see anybody in the hall at all !<ssssss>i sometimes feel like we be stay in someone 's guest room !<ssssss>all in all , if you like a quiet neighborhood set oppose to 5th ave. and you do not mind the smallness of the room or share the toilet with other , well , then $ 114 a night be worth it !<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		not all that !!<ssssss>first off they make I put a deposit down on the room , i stay one night 2-14-05 and they take this deposit from my debit card , i do not bring a credit card but do not know i need one to stay in the room , i think i would pay after check out time , i even ask if i have to pay upfront while make reservation and the young lady state no after you check out , when i show up all of a sudden the story have change ... hmmm wonder if it be because i be a black woman travel alone , i be well dress and behave so it could not have be that or maybe it be just company policy , i definitely be not treat this way at golden gate hotel i do not know why a pay customer would have to put a deposit down unless they think i be go to skip out on they or something , i want to enjoy my stay so i let that one slide .<ssssss>do not get I wrong , i be not accuse they of any racist behavior but i definitely think it be weird to ask for a deposit upfront.the water have no pressure and i could only take a shower not a bath as i so desire , no face towel in the room , one of the light fixture do not work .<ssssss>you would think for a $ 230 deposit you would think that the internet would be free , not at all , it be $ 10.95 to use it , be as at the golden gate hotel it be free !!<ssssss>no complimentary breakfast or afternoon tea , whereas at the golden gate hotel it be serve to all the guest .<ssssss>i pay $ 107 a night at the golden gate and it be worth it .<ssssss>on valentine day i want to treat myself due to not have a date or plan and think it would be cool to get away and stay at a nice hotel , besides i always want to know what it would be like to stay in a expensive hotel and for I outside of the nice view i have , it be a total disappointment .<ssssss>the concierge be semi-cold and the only guy i really like be the doorman , outside of that everything else be for show .<ssssss>way too impersonal of a place of course i be a black female staying alone so a few stare be in play by the hotel security , -lrb- feel like i be be watch for solicitation -rrb- i hope they make I put a deposit down on the room be not because i be black and i must say that i do not see any other black people in the hotel ... guess i make they nervous .<ssssss>to everyone go to this hotel , please be aware of the fact that , although you may pay a huge amount of money to sleep in 5 star hotel , you not always get what you pay for .<ssssss>i be from dalla and i would take golden gate hotel over hotel nikko any day.good luck !<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 4 5 3 3		security issue .<ssssss>my husband and i recently stay four night at novotel paris gare montparnasse .<ssssss>we arrive in from cdg and be advise by the hotel to take the air france shuttle which cost 15euro per person single journey to montparnasse gare .<ssssss>the walk from the bus stop to the hotel be a easy stroll of 10 minutes.we arrive at the hotel at 11am and the receptionist be very helpful and we be check into we room straight away .<ssssss>the hotel be modern but basic and we be pleasantly surprise with the size of we room and bathroom , although there be very little wardrope space , it be prefectly exceptable .<ssssss>we do not hear any noise from we neighbour and the airconditioning be adequate as be the tea and coffee make facitly and small fridge .<ssssss>we only compaint be that on we last day we return to we hotel room to discover that we room have be search , although nothing have be take .<ssssss>we report this to the hotel manger who inform we that it be hotel policy to do random search by the security officer .<ssssss>this do spoil we stay and we wouldnt stay at the novotel again only because of this reason .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 2 4 3 -1		only good if want to stay near the airport to depart early morning i have to wait one day in sidney for my next flight , so i need a hotel that be close to the airport and with good connection .<ssssss>the hotel be quite basic , but serve my purpose well .<ssssss>the airport shuttle be 5 aud , but i think it be fair if compare to what you would pay with a taxi or even the train .<ssssss>if you be look for a similar hotel in the area , i see a holiday inn one block away that look nicer -lrb- at least from the outside -rrb- , so check the reviews.the good : the staff be professional and helpful .<ssssss>it be 500 meter away from mascot train station , so you can easily move around with public transport .<ssssss>however , bear in mind that the area get quite desert during the night , so i would not recommend it if you be plan to come late at night .<ssssss>room be very small , in particular for australian standard , but ok for stay overnight .<ssssss>the so-so : the bathroom be really , really small -lrb- really ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>it be ok for I , but i be not sure oversized people would fit in they .<ssssss>on top , it be a bit smelly .<ssssss>the room do not feel 100 % clean , but it could have be due to the stain in the carpet -lrb- to be fair , a previous gest have the bright idea of iron in the carpet so it be burn ... -rrb- .<ssssss>the bad : wall be very thin , so you get to hear all sort of noise .<ssssss>it get particularly bad if you have some aussie neighbour who go drinking and arrive late in the night -lrb- i.e. a 70 % chance of experience it -rrb- .<ssssss>the bottom line : only good if you arrive late in sidney and need a cheap place to leave early next day .<ssssss>if you need space and silence to sleep , and be ready to pay for it , then check other option .<ssssss>and if you do not leave too early in the morning , i would rather recommend to stay closer to down town -lrb- darling harbour in particular -rrb- and to get the train from there .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		date , overprice - disappointing i travel around europe all the time on business - especially in spain - and so have good experience of 5 star quality .<ssssss>this hotel be lack to say the least .<ssssss>the room be date - very 80s with yellow , orange and brown furnishings .<ssssss>the lack of restaurant in the hotel be also a real problem - the garden restaurant be not open on sunday and monday night and you can only use the hotel buffet restaurant or room service plus there be no good restaurant nearby .<ssssss>the room service be pretty dreadful - zero imagination in the chicken supreme dish -lrb- grilled chicken and some boil veggy on the side -rrb- and no guideline to healthy option etc. price-wise it be too expensive -lrb- â‚ ?<ssssss>20 for a twin room not inc breakfast but it be formula 1 weekend so that explain it to a point -rrb- .<ssssss>best thing about it be the gym - excellent facility .<ssssss>personnel be also good - very polite and efficient .<ssssss>in a nutshell , the hotel badly need to be redesign and refurbish with a modern menu and more restaurant choice for guest .<ssssss>
2 -1 4 3 4 5 3 5		lovely beach and resort grounds but that be it !<ssssss>we stay at the pcp from june 18th throught the 25th and have the vip package for what that be worth .<ssssss>we have be to many all-inclusive and consider ourselves not very picky or hard to please .<ssssss>let I start out with the positive : yes the garden be well keep and we even tip the gardener for they hard work .<ssssss>the beach be nice , the water clear , the sand white and smooth .<ssssss>expect to walk out about 15 foot and then it do drop off .<ssssss>the most beautiful beach we encounter be on we tour with the dune buggy .<ssssss>that beach be call macao beach .<ssssss>if you take this tour you will get extremely muddy and the mud do not come out of you clothes , so bring clothes that you do not care about .<ssssss>do bring candy or treat for all the child that come out of they house to bring you picture and flower .<ssssss>i give a few of they a dollar , but wish we would have know to give they something else .<ssssss>check in be smooth and you do get they punch and a cool washcloth which you will need after you very bumpy ride to the resort .<ssssss>every resort i have be to have do the same thing though .<ssssss>it take about 45 minute as you have to drop everyone else off and this be one of the last resort .<ssssss>my advice would be be to get you own taxi to and from so you do not have to wait .<ssssss>friend that we meet pay 33 usd at night from the airport which be higher than they daytime fee .<ssssss>the conceirge service in the lobby be helpful , polite , take we to we room right away with we luggage .<ssssss>we do get the fruit basket , 1 small bottle of rum , 1 small box of 3 cigar , and the towel decorate with flower .<ssssss>yes the room stay moist as it be humid .<ssssss>remember to bring a candle and it will keep you room smell fresh all week long.the room need major update .<ssssss>the bathroom be very outdated .<ssssss>they be rusty .<ssssss>we drain be always stop up when take we daily shower , wash cloth be only present on the first day , but we know this and have bring we own .<ssssss>maid service come in the early afternoon and late at night for turn down service which be a nice touch.we stay in the 5000 building on the bottom floor which be nice since it be 20 foot from the pool .<ssssss>we be not early riser and we be never disturb by any pool noise .<ssssss>some friend have the third floor and say the high ceiling make you room feel larger and they could see the ocean .<ssssss>there be many channel to watch about 1/4 in english.the food : after read the review i expect way more than what be speak about .<ssssss>the tex-mex filet mignon i receive be tough but my husband 's be cook just right but not anything to brag about .<ssssss>the plate always come out hot and so will you caesar salad .<ssssss>this be really the only salad to speak of here at the resort .<ssssss>everytime you get a drink , make sure you ask for you glass to be fill with ice or you will be drink hot whatever you drink .<ssssss>this be throughout the resort .<ssssss>il bacio , the italian restaurant be way below average .<ssssss>i end up get sick after eat the smallest portion of lasagna i have ever be serve .<ssssss>they do serve my husband a second piece to compensate for he be able to eat it in 4 bite .<ssssss>we friend say they have enjoy it there and get big help of the ravioli and fettucinus .<ssssss>we never eat at the fondue but hear it be good .<ssssss>we friend say it take 3 hour and there be no ac in there and it become very hot in there once they serve the different fondue to everyone.they also say the seafood restaurant be good , but we do not care for seafood so we do not eat there .<ssssss>all the buffet be way below average .<ssssss>there be no taste to any of the food and it be very bland .<ssssss>luckily i survive off of rice and bread all week .<ssssss>everyone we meet get sick at the resort include we and we could never pinpoint what we eat or if it be what we drink .<ssssss>the bar tender be average and not very animated compare to other place we have be to .<ssssss>the drink be just ok .<ssssss>and i finally have to make up my own drink for the week as they could never get it right .<ssssss>there be no cranberry juice here , nor coconut rum or real orange juice .<ssssss>the margarita be nasty and they do not even carry any name brand tequila .<ssssss>the animation team be just plain annoy .<ssssss>the same stupid dancing and yell of applauso throughout the day at the pool make you not want to be there .<ssssss>we have we everyday player for volleyball in the pool which be fun except we have to fight the animation team to get a decent ball everyday to play .<ssssss>then once we be out there , they harrass we to do they activity which we do not want to do , so they would come over into we game and try to take over .<ssssss>the gift shop be way over price compare to anything else .<ssssss>if you want to get deal you must go down to the beach about 1 mile to the left .<ssssss>you must heavily barter to get a cheapy cheapy price .<ssssss>they will give you the calculator and tell you what do you want to pay .<ssssss>we always end up pay half of what they be ask .<ssssss>do not pay more than 5 dollar for any shirt or hat .<ssssss>coffee should be around $ 6 and windchime $ 20 .<ssssss>painting $ 20-30 medium size .<ssssss>make sure you bring pants and dress shoe for the guy as you can not get into any of the restaurant except the buffet without they .<ssssss>we think this be ridiculous as the girl could come in with just shorts , flip flop and a tank top .<ssssss>go figure !<ssssss>we go to to caribe princess for the show .<ssssss>one day we have walk over there to find out no show be go on even though it be advertise .<ssssss>would we go back to the pcp or the dominican republic again ?<ssssss>no .<ssssss>just a note we best waiter for the week be serapio at the beach breakfast buffet .<ssssss>he be so attentive and really go out of he way .<ssssss>if you go in to the bavaro shopping center , expect to be call name and be insult over try to barter .<ssssss>they do not want to go down even a 1/4 and i guess they do not need the money even though it be one of the most poorest country with trash everywhere , with dead animal on the side of the road wait to be slaughter .<ssssss>the road be the worst i have see and wehave be to many place .<ssssss>if you have any question please feel free to contact I for a honest review .<ssssss>hi to victor , pura , adrienne , todd , terry and bob .<ssssss>shoot we a email we would love to hear from you .<ssssss>

2 2 4 1 4 3 3 3		nowhere near the beach or sea and in a run down location eight of we go to barcelona for a few day to chill and relax , eat out in some nice restaurant and explore the sight .<ssssss>totally disappoint when we discover where the hotel be situate as it be in what be almost a building site with a vacant disused car park in front of it .<ssssss>the hotel itself be stylish and very modern and clean but the area be run down and mile from where we want to be .<ssssss>to get to the small man-made beach you have to walk about fifteen to twenty minute cross huge roadway and motorway .<ssssss>taxis bus and the metro the only way to get into the city itself .<ssssss>at night difficult to get taxi and return to hotel taxi could not even find it as area be all one way .<ssssss>we be deposit literally in the middle of this building area .<ssssss>not suitable for girl and woman travel to barcelona .<ssssss>it be near a big shopping centre and a convention centre .<ssssss>better to stay in centre of barcelona .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 5 5 5 5		noise issue for some room very nice hotel , room be a bit small but nicely appoint .<ssssss>staff be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>one problem which i consider unacceptable be we room be locate on the 6th floor , backside of the building , which be right across the alley from the hvac system of the building next door .<ssssss>it be very loud and make for a terrible night 's sleep .<ssssss>the hotel be fully book , so no relief be available.if you choose this hotel , make sure you request a room face 4th or olive st .<ssssss>the traffic noise be to be expect in a downtown hotel , but not the alternative.other than that , great place .<ssssss>
4 2 3 5 5 4 4 4		great location we be a couple aged 19 and stay at the albus grand hotel for 4 night .<ssssss>the hotel it self be ok , the room be rather small and the room be boil .<ssssss>i would not recomend go here in warm weather .<ssssss>the hotel location be brilliant .<ssssss>it be only a short walk away from dam square .<ssssss>we only have breakfast in the hotel once and it be horrible , i would not recomend this at all .<ssssss>the tram stop just outside the hotel and it cost less that 2euro to get to dam square.would not recomend eat in the pizza resteraunt next store , but dam square have lovely place to eat .<ssssss>overall this hotel be great for its location , and if like we all you want be just a place to sleep as we be out most of the time explore the city , it be ideal<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 4 -1 2 -1		loud tram noise do not risk this hotel - although it be well situate there be a lot of noisey tram go past the window .<ssssss>they finish around 1.00 be but start again at around 6.00 am .<ssssss>there be no double glazing .<ssssss>the room at the back be ok but i would not risk it !<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 5 4 5 3		tragically hip .<ssssss>try hard but leave room to be desire the hotel be locate a quick walk 's away from the bustling downtown area in westwood , so the location be good .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and work hard to make you experience pleasurable .<ssssss>however , the hotel be try so hard to be hip that it do not always seem to cater to the need of average people .<ssssss>for example , my bathroom be tiny .<ssssss>the rest of the room be fine , except the bathroom be so small that there be no place to place my dopp kit .<ssssss>also , the gym be very underwhelming for a hotel in this price range .<ssssss>the food option be limit , but that be expect for a w property.all in all , it be a fine place to stay , especially give the limited choice in westwood .<ssssss>just do not expect too much .<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great stay at the belvedere myself , my girlfriend and my brother stay for 4 night at the belvedere .<ssssss>i must say that i find the other review on the site most helpful when choose a hotel for we first stay in nyc .<ssssss>the belvedere do not disappoint .<ssssss>the room have 2 double , nice bathroom and a small kitchen area -lrb- fridge a microwave -rrb- .<ssssss>the fridge be very useful after return from a long day out and about .<ssssss>we stay on the 5th floor so the poor elevator service be not much of a issue but i could see how it would annoy .<ssssss>the hotel be very central , plenty of subway bus stop very nearby and all of the site be easily accessible from here .<ssssss>i would definitely stay here again.a big thank you to everyone who contribute to the review and forum , it be a wonderful help when plan a trip away .<ssssss>

4 3 3 -1 5 -1 5 -1		not much to fault it -lrb- but -rrb- i have choose this hotel totally on the back of read review on tripadvisor .<ssssss>when you be work to a budget , you want absolutely everything for the best price .<ssssss>i have ask for a view of the pool before we stay and the staff be lovely about this .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we have only book a double which dont have balcony but they give we the only room with a huge window overlook the pool which look lovely at night which be all i have really wanted have see the picture on the internet beforehand .<ssssss>we could just see the club twinkling opposite above the other room .<ssssss>we be a bit unsure about how safe we be in la so we decide to order takeaway to we room both night .<ssssss>despite ask lot of question about how to go about this , the staff be always please to give advice and offer we menu to look at .<ssssss>i have to say that both meal be absolutely wonderful .<ssssss>i be a bit disappointed with the room i guess as it have no bedside lamp which mean that you have to get out of bed to turn the light off and also despite have item to make coffee , no coffee machine ???<ssssss>the thing which i find most difficult however be the noise .<ssssss>i be from the country in lincolnshire and be use to quiet at night but there be a constant hum all of the time - we guess from the pool .<ssssss>but on top of this , the fridge be also very loud and we neighbour decide it be a good idea to play they tv very loud until about 3 in the morning not consider other guest at all .<ssssss>this be of course we honest opinion and would not want to put other people off from use what be a lovely hotel in a great location , with great staff and secure parking -lrb- small charge -rrb- .<ssssss>not it be not 5 star but then it do not claim to be !!<ssssss>

4 3 3 5 4 4 -1 5		hotel metro ... great location !<ssssss>.<ssssss>view of room from door way<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 2 2 2		disappointing disappointing .<ssssss>on arrive at noon , slightly ahead of normal check-in time , we be happy to be give a split-level room that look really nice .<ssssss>because workman be in the room next door hammer so hard the mirror be shake on the wall , we decide to go out for the afternoon and look round the hotel later .<ssssss>get back at 5 to find the work be still go on â€?weâ€™d naively assume it be just a quick bit of maintenance .<ssssss>so we go to the front desk and ask what be go on .<ssssss>turn out the work would be ongoing , all day , every day , throughout we stay .<ssssss>with five floor of room and a hotel that seem at best half full , why the **** put we next door to it?to â€˜apologiseâ€ ?<ssssss>they move we into another room that be a upgrade to a suite .<ssssss>to be honest , iâ€™d rather have have the first room , just elsewhere in the hotel .<ssssss>the suite be right at the end of the corridor on the very last floor , and feel like the room that never get use except for last resort .<ssssss>the bath be a ancient plastic thing with jet that be break and rust .<ssssss>the bedroom , far from the spacious and modern feel the split-level room have have , be a tiny bare room where the bed just fit in , with nothing on the wall , and a tv with a broken remote control .<ssssss>be a suite , there be a separate sit area , which be fine , and a huge hall/vestibule which be pretty meaningless really â€?what use be that?worst of all be the constant noise from the plumbing .<ssssss>a steady drip noise and wheeze pipe , 24 hour a day .<ssssss>the noise of guest in another room flush the toilet be incredible from we bedroom â€?like a cascade flood , and much much louder than the toilet in we bathroom itself .<ssssss>on several occasion both my wife and i be shock awake by it .<ssssss>on the second night my wife even go and sleep on the sofa in the sit area as she couldnâ€™t sleep for the plumbing noise .<ssssss>hardly five star.i suppose we should have ask to move again , but by then we be feed up and just want to leave really .<ssssss>

2 2 1 5 2 3 3 1		the only really good part be the location .<ssssss>the sebel pier one be on a pier at the rock - a excellent location .<ssssss>however , the room we have be tiny and with uncomfortable modern decor that give the style a bad name .<ssssss>for instance , the platform bed hold a thin mattress that be only marginally less firm than the floor , and there be only a small table and a narrow counter type piece of furniture -lrb- which hold the tv , telephone , stationery , etc. -rrb- on which to place belongings .<ssssss>the lighting be dim and strange -lrb- a large light in the floor ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i will not go into detail about the cleanliness -lrb- lack of -rrb- of the room.the stay would have be acceptable have it not be for the bathroom .<ssssss>here the designer really excel at unfunctional design .<ssssss>it be huge ... but have no counter space .<ssssss>the sink drain be very slow and we be go to call the front desk .<ssssss>a little later , there be a loud whoosh and gurgle and it drain .<ssssss>this happen every day .<ssssss>the shower -lrb- no tub -rrb- be one of those that be open to the rest of the space with only a small drain and lip of tile .<ssssss>it be very slippery , so we wear flip-flop -lrb- which traveler should probably do routinely anyway -rrb- .<ssssss>of course , the water go into other area of the bath , include the commode fitting into the floor .<ssssss>rock toilet make for a interesting experience .<ssssss>

1 1 2 5 1 1 1 1		do not stay here ever !!!!<ssssss>first off the service be awful the valet be $ 30 dollar reasonable if you think the self park be only $ 2.00 less .<ssssss>so we do the valet the manager / supervisor i give you tell we to park we car on the other side of the street so we do in a no parking zone that they say would be okay .<ssssss>we check in come out and go to the new orlean bowl festivity on we way we car be still there .<ssssss>the same night we go to bourbon street which be a perfect location the only plus of stay at this hotel .<ssssss>on we way in for the night the elevator be stick we pass some people who do not have a room because they over book the hotel and these people have reservation .<ssssss>it get better we wake up the next morning go to take a shower and get some breakfast there be not hot water .<ssssss>we call they tell they be work on it we let the water run for 15 minute and call back they tell we oh its fix now .<ssssss>we never have hot water .<ssssss>the water be not just cold but ice cold .<ssssss>i know how the people on the titanic feel now and i could only wash my hair .<ssssss>thank goodness i be go home the same day and do not have to have a shower .<ssssss>so after the lie about the hot water we get to the front desk to check out and turn out nobody in the entire hotel have hot water include the 4 or 5 group that check out with we .<ssssss>if you think it can not get any better they tell we one of we car get tow .<ssssss>there be nothing they could do even though the guy that tell we this be the guy that just tell I to park my car they thank goodness i be with a friend who could take I to the new orlean city impoud to get my car that cost $ 120.00 to get out and the all the hotel could do be not charge I the valet fee well i guess so i never use you service .<ssssss>we get lose and try to call for direction and the manager get a attitude with we .<ssssss>therefore my advice to anyone park you own car and never trust a valet .<ssssss>

2 -1 2 5 3 3 2 -1		it be a 2 star hotel hotel city park pelayo barcelonamy husband and i stay here for 3 night in late september/october .<ssssss>it fit we criterion of a/c , fridge , non smoking and a safe in the room .<ssssss>we book it through expedia in july before we set off on a long trip and it be amongst the most expensive hotel we stay in .<ssssss>129.00 euro room only .<ssssss>and the least value for money .<ssssss>the lobby be tiny , as be the lift .<ssssss>needless to say so be the room .<ssssss>the bed be so small it canâ€™t even have be a double .<ssssss>it be downright uncomfortable too .<ssssss>there be no night table by the window side , so we push the bed against the window wall to be able to move at all .<ssssss>we be fall over we bag as it be .<ssssss>the wardrobe be minute there be only room to hang up 2 jacket , and be really only the entry to the water downpipe .<ssssss>every time someone upstairs have a shower or use the loo we know about it.there be a stand at the end of the bed contain t.v. and a espresso machine , with 2 plastic disposable shot cup and 2 sachet of coffee .<ssssss>minibar underneath no milk provided.the 1st day we return in the middle of the day and be surprise that the coffee and cup be not replace , neither be the towel .<ssssss>so we ask for , and get they assume it be just sloppy housekeeping.the 2nd day towel replenish but no coffee .<ssssss>when my husband ask for it he be tell that they only supply once .<ssssss>when he point out that we be pay the same rate every night he be give 2 sachets-we have buy we own milk already .<ssssss>it be just ridiculous the machine would only hold these little sachet ; iâ€™ve no idea where one would buy they .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t bother ask for new disposable cup - -lrb- they be never replace -rrb- as we have we own basic travel picnic gear and we feel it just wasnâ€™t worth the hassle !<ssssss>we make sure we ask for-and get coffee we last night , ready for the morningthe bathroom be -lrb- naturally -rrb- tiny , and no toiletries supply apart from soap.they have a breakfast room but we never eat there , plenty of other place nearby.on the plus side the position be very handy calle del pelai corner of ronda de la universitat .<ssssss>close to placa de catalunya square and la rambla but itâ€™s almost on a traffic island , so very noisy from that and we room have virtually no insulation.i always sleep in earplug and my husband can sleep through anything , but it could be a big problem for other people.the a/c work very well , and there be a safe amongst the down pipe of the wardrobe.no sign of smoking in the room.fortunately we didnâ€™t go to barcelona to spend much time in the room.apart from all the usual tourist thing we have dinner at lo caracole , and i can thoroughly recommend it !<ssssss>the food wasnâ€™t great but the experience be .<ssssss>we hadnâ€™t book but fortunately get there about 8.40 pm and only have to wait 1 Â¼ hour in the bar .<ssssss>by which time we have make several new friend and get rather sozzled.on the extreme downside , my husband have he pocket pick come down from parc guel to the open top bus stop .<ssssss>we think it must have happen when we step back to let a couple pass we on the very narrow footpath .<ssssss>donâ€™t let you guard down for a second in barcelona .<ssssss>
2 4 3 2 3 5 2 4		a good value , some problem .<ssssss>we stay at the holiday inn fisherman 's wharf for two night for a business meeting and find the room to be just fine .<ssssss>it be clean and we have everything we need .<ssssss>we view be the wall next door , but we be not in the room much and we just keep the curtain close when we be .<ssssss>that really do not matter because we have be to san francisco so often that we have see the view and be not particularly interested in one .<ssssss>it be always nice , however .<ssssss>if i have be a tourist see san francisco for the first time , i would probably want a better view .<ssssss>wifi be free everywhere in the hotel.the service at the front desk be delightful and helpful .<ssssss>a big problem be that the bar be dark , gloomy and the service surly .<ssssss>we do not eat breakfast at the restaurant because it be very expensive .<ssssss>not a fan of the fisherman 's wharf area , i hop the street car to the embarcadero for a noah 's bagel breakfast sandwich .<ssssss>if you like the area , denny 's be a block away from the holiday inn fisherman 's wharf .<ssssss>there be many other restaurant within a easy walk - 15 minute to north beach and 20 to chinatown .<ssssss>the cable car and street car line be within a block or two , so get around be easy .<ssssss>another problem be that the hotel allow the we be cheaper than the taxi limo scam to take place on they property .<ssssss>do not ask the doorman to get you a taxi , he will steer you to the limo - do not fall for it , the limo be always more expensive than a taxi .<ssssss>just take the taxi wait on property , call for one , or walk up to the street and one will appear soon .<ssssss>one convenience be that there be a safeway , sav on pharmacy and trader joe 's a couple of block up bay street .<ssssss>the best shopping be in union square or the embarcadero but again , transportation be easy .<ssssss>i prefer the embarcadero or union square location in san francisco but the holiday inn fisherman 's wharf be a good value .<ssssss>
1 1 4 5 4 1 -1 2		do not stay here !!<ssssss>do not stay here !<ssssss>as a long time patron of the fairmont-sf , i be appale upon a recent stay with the horrible service .<ssssss>in the past , i have receive impeccable service and a fantasitc room .<ssssss>as a fairmont president 's club member , i have simply phone the hotel , book a suite and everything be fantastic .<ssssss>my latest experience leave I never want to stay at the fairmont-sf ever again .<ssssss>apparently management at the hotel have change and they do not care if you be a return guest , a new guest , or anything at all except be rude with everyone with whom they come into contact .<ssssss>whatever you do , do not stay here !<ssssss>the hotel itself be beautiful but current management be atrocious - they need to learn that the customer be always right , not that new management be go to change thing and treat old customer like dirt .<ssssss>whatever you do , do not stay here !<ssssss>you will be sorry and disappointed !<ssssss>

2 2 3 5 5 2 1 -1		disappointing .<ssssss>5 * build run as 2-3 * hotel stay here at the begining of june have choose it after read the review on this site but be very disappointed .<ssssss>on the positive side , the location be unbeatable , the decor beautiful and the hotel very clean .<ssssss>but ... we arrive well after check in time but we room be not ready and have to wait nearly half a hour for it .<ssssss>we be give a chit to take to the bar for a complementary drink whilst we wait .<ssssss>we go to the bar which be unattended , there be no bell or any way of attract attention .<ssssss>we could here the staff in the room behind the bar so , after 7 or 8 minute , we politely call out to they .<ssssss>we be very surprised -lrb- and shock -rrb- when a male voice shout back wait a minute .<ssssss>a couple of minute later a female open the door , poke she head out , and again say wait a minute .<ssssss>it be a further 2-3 minute before we eventually be served.we book a de-luxe room which be small , as we expect have read the review here , however , it be the terrace that really disappoint we .<ssssss>we select the de-luxe room specifically for the terrace which be not only much smaller than expect -lrb- the one either side of ours be much bigger -rrb- but also instead of the stone balustrade show in the picture , we have a solid wall face we which not only allow we no view , but also make it dark and quite dingy .<ssssss>there be no seperate shower cubicle as some other room seem to have .<ssssss>we room be by the elevator and there be the constant noise of the elevator ping and of other guest laughing and joking throughout the night -lrb- fault of the room not the guest -rrb- .<ssssss>have miss eat one evening we discover that room service finish at 11pm .<ssssss>there be absolutely no food available in the hotel after this hour .<ssssss>i have never before come across a hotel that could not russle up at least a basic sandwich , even if nothing else .<ssssss>breakfast be the worst part of the experience .<ssssss>it be very poor but pricey -lrb- 19 euro -rrb- .<ssssss>have sit ourselves down and have wait several minute , we have to call the attention of one of the waiter , who have totally ignore we up to that point , to ask for tea and coffee .<ssssss>when it eventually come , nearly 10 minute later , the coffee be fine but tea be a cup of hot water and a point at the teabag on the table .<ssssss>no milk and when request , hot milk be bring .<ssssss>i should mention that the room be not even half full so there be no excuse of be busy or they be rush off they feet.the cook food be not only not freshly cook , but the pre-cooked food be place on a normal , unheated counter therefore it be barely warm and very unappetising .<ssssss>this be truely the worst breakfast , food and service , that i have receive anywhere , include in 3rd world country and travelodge !<ssssss>there be several other niggle that i will not mention now.i wonder afterwards about the great review that have be give here and realise that have we :1 .<ssssss>arrive a hour later - we would not have know that we room be not ready and would not have go to the bar and experience the problem there .2 .<ssssss>be allocate a different room , there be clearly better de-luxe room - we would not have be disappoint with the terrace .3 .<ssssss>be allocate a room away from the elevator - we would not have be wake up several time a night or be aware that some guest be experience that .4 .<ssssss>not miss we evening meal - we would not have want food at midnight therefore we would not have know that it be not available .5 .<ssssss>not have breakfast in the hotel - we would not have know how bad it was.had none of the above thing occur we would have go away have feeling that we have stay in a well located , clean , beautiful look hotel .<ssssss>we would have be unaware of the shortcoming of it , and , in ignorance , give it a undeserved very good , review.maybe we be just unlucky with we room allocation , but unless you have be there before and specifically request to have or ask not to be give a particular room , you can not know whether you have be allocate a good or a poor room .<ssssss>a good hotel should offer a consistently good experience , which ever room you be in or whatever time/period you stay there in .<ssssss>hotel 1898 do not offer this consistency .<ssssss>we may have be unlucky but so might you be !!!<ssssss>the building have the makings of a 5 * hotel but unfortunately it be run like a 2-3 * one .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 5 3 5		not the greatest this trip this be the second time we stay at the davazanti and be give a fairly large room that be as if we be in a basement with a high window only look up onto someone 's private apartment doorway -- the room be otherwise nice but , geeze , rather claustrophobic and dreary with no daylight in the window .<ssssss>breakfast be fairly ordinary , certainly not the best in italy ; the room boast a convenient and handy laptop with free internet service .<ssssss>fabrizio and tomaso be most helpful in arrange dinner reservation .<ssssss>they have what could be a delightful gratis happy hour each evening with prosecco and red wine that be to my taste ruin by the very loud and abrasive/racuous music , perhaps purposefully design to get people in and out quickly .<ssssss>we likely will stay elsewhwere during future trip to firenze .<ssssss>
5 5 5 2 5 4 4 4		very nice hotel , far from the city center we stay at this hotel for ten day on a combined business/sightseeing trip .<ssssss>we be attend a conference hold at this hotel ; otherwise we probably would not have book it since it be be very far from the city center.however , we find the hotel to be a excellent choice .<ssssss>the property be beautiful and have all the amenity expect of a good five-star hotel -lrb- pool , spa , shopping , gym , tennis , bowling ... -rrb- .<ssssss>there be many excellent restaurant on-site , which be good since there be not much else in this area .<ssssss>the restaurant be generally rather pricey by beij standard , but still much cheaper than we be use to so we do not mind .<ssssss>the room be very spacious , immaculately clean and well-decorated .<ssssss>the bathroom be very large with lovely furnishings .<ssssss>free bottled water be provide in the room since the tap water be not safe to drink .<ssssss>in-room internet access be available for a cost - however you pay only when log on , and while we be online frequently the total cost for the stay be negligible.we pay a very reasonable 650 yuan per night , include the buffet breakfast which be very extensive , and excellent quality .<ssssss>there be of course much cheaper hotel in beijing , but this seem to be a good price for a five-star hotel.the location be the main downside , since it do take some time to get into the center .<ssssss>however we find it to be simple and inexpensive : a five-minute taxi to longze station -lrb- 12 yuan every time -rrb- , follow by the line 13 train and the line 2 subway -lrb- 5 yuan total -rrb- .<ssssss>it take up to a hour but again , be quite simple .<ssssss>note that it be not really possible to walk anywhere from this hotel , since the highway be very close .<ssssss>
4 5 2 3 4 4 5 -1		saturday 's be `` different '' just come back from this resort after stay 4 night for a wedding .<ssssss>the overall experience be fantastic , but , alot of that be due to be there with a large group of fun and interesting people who be all connect through the wedding party .<ssssss>there be only one real negative that i see so i will report on that first and then give my take on the rest of it : i be there from wednesday to sunday , and from wednesday to saturday afternoon , the resort be make up of primarily american , european and canadian tourist .<ssssss>on saturday , i observe several bus load of local tourist arrive in the lobby .<ssssss>some say that the resort heavily discount weekend rate for local .<ssssss>not sure what the story be , but the population at the pool and pool bar be different and much more crowd on saturday .<ssssss>the nightclub which play great american music the prior three night , switch to accomodate all of the local and play nothing but spanish music all night .<ssssss>this be unfortunate because even with we group , many couldnt take the positively endless barrage of spanish music .<ssssss>it be 3 straight hour of it -lrb- and im sure much more after i leave -rrb- .<ssssss>i give the food rating a c + .<ssssss>if you like to have great food on you trip , this may not be the place for you .<ssssss>i didnt mind the food and its not like anyone be get sick from it , but many of the offering be just average at best .<ssssss>they do the local cusine very well -lrb- rice , bean , churiso , salsa , banana , etc -rrb- , but thing that arent they specialty really suffer , which be a lot of dish .<ssssss>luckily , im not a foodie so this didnt bother I at all .<ssssss>not sure if other resort in the area have better food , this be my first time in dr.the pool be huge and relaxing with good service at the pool bar .<ssssss>they play alot of local music during the day and have contest and class at the pool .<ssssss>this be fun for the 5 or so people who get involve -lrb- in a salsa dance lesson for example -rrb- but im guess that for the rest of the people at the pool who be try to relax or have conversation , its a bit intrusive to hear these class broadcast over the loud speakers.the nightlife be above average .<ssssss>lot of bar to choose from and they have the live dance show every night if that you thing .<ssssss>again , i be with a big , fun crowd so it be pretty easy for we to enjoy the nightlife -lrb- except on saturday at the club which be terrible -rrb- .<ssssss>the beach be great .<ssssss>plenty of seating and shade and i walk the beach at one point to about 10 other resort and ocean blue be at least as good as those , and in many case , ocean blue be far better lay out.the resort be a good size .<ssssss>not too big as i have hear other be in dr. everything in less than a 5 minute walk away .<ssssss>this be important because some resort be way too big and its a chore to go from one part -lrb- beach -rrb- to another -lrb- the pool or you room , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>build 8 or 9 be the most centrally located group of room .<ssssss>closest to everything , i recommend those.ok , that all i can think of .<ssssss>feel free to email I if you have any question .<ssssss>overall , i have a unbelievable time attend this wedding .<ssssss>not sure that i would necessarily go back to this resort , but it be a great location for a destination wedding , particularly if you have a decent size group .<ssssss>

3 4 2 5 3 2 5 -1		mixed thought when i arrive at the condado , i be initially very excite as i pull up in my rental car .<ssssss>from the outside , i feel like i be go to be stay at a top notch hotel with impecable service .<ssssss>while my overall stay be pleasant , i have mix feeling about the hotel .<ssssss>pro : it be definitely in the best location .<ssssss>situate at the end of the condado strip within walk distance of shopping , cafe , rest .<ssssss>and other hotel while just step from the bridge to old san juan where you can find the best nightlife in the carribean .<ssssss>the pool area be very relaxing .<ssssss>you have many option .<ssssss>you can sit in a shaded area on a lounge chair along the larger pool , or roast in the sun by the smaller pool .<ssssss>or , for a perfect , relax nap you can chill on one of the hammock string between palm tree on the main lawn overlook the ocean .<ssssss>the overall atmosphere down by the pool be amazing and sure to wipe away any stress you come down with .<ssssss>what make it even better be the outstanding pool staff of waitress and bartender .<ssssss>they be so friendly , fast and personable that i be compel to leave a very generous tip .<ssssss>however , the pricing of the food make I choke !!!<ssssss>$ 13.00 for a turkey wrap .<ssssss>.<ssssss>even in ny we do not have price like that .<ssssss>the cleaning staff do a great job as well and be friendly .<ssssss>con : as great as the hotel appear to look from the outside , i could not believe how they overlook small detail that really ruin my initial impression of the hotel .<ssssss>for example , the window in my room be so filthy and dingy that i could barely get a clear view .<ssssss>my room also have many mark and scrape on the wall .<ssssss>i also notice paint peel from the outside of the hotel near the balcony .<ssssss>for a hotel that just undergo major renovation , i do not see how they can allow these very visable eyesore to exist ; especially since it would not take much effort to fix .<ssssss>that make I wonder how much they do care about customer service and appearance .<ssssss>if they want to classify themselves as a luxury hotel , you can not have these condition .<ssssss>also , when i check in , i have to wait for 10 min .<ssssss>while the clerk be on the phone .<ssssss>and , he be not friendly at all .<ssssss>when i ask he about late check out , he give I a attitude .<ssssss>not the right thing to do to a first time guest .<ssssss>i be also a little dispointed with the beach .<ssssss>have pay the $ $ , i would expect to have a little more privacy on the beach .<ssssss>they seem to allow all the local to use the beach which get very crowded and noisy .<ssssss>if i want to go to a public beach , i could have stay at a much cheaper hotel in downtown san juan and walk to a beach .<ssssss>overall , i do enjoy my stay .<ssssss>but as a frequent carribean traveler , you get more critical of the little detail that make a big difference .<ssssss>with the exception of my check in clerk , the staff be very professional and accomodate .<ssssss>i do get the late check out without much resistance and the girl who check I out explain the bill in great detail and even find a mistake from the parking garage ... thank you !!!<ssssss>i would stay here again just because of the location of the hotel and the outstanding pool and lounge area .<ssssss>but please , rethink about allow the beach to be open to the public and take care of those little eyesore .<ssssss>they can really bring the appearance down and make the hotel look sloppy and dirty .<ssssss>i will be back !!<ssssss>
4 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		of course it be good , but it be not worth stay at really good hotel , but that be to be expect at this price .<ssssss>the question be ... be it worth it ?<ssssss>and the answer be no .<ssssss>why ?<ssssss>because ... 1 .<ssssss>location .<ssssss>barcelona be not the place to go for great beach .<ssssss>so why stay at the beach ?<ssssss>you go there for the food , the gothic quarter , the architecture , the bar , the culture , and the vibe .<ssssss>stay out here alienate you from most of that -lrb- unless the pinnacle of you barcelona visit be to be a night out at the baja beach club in which case ignore everything i say -rrb- .<ssssss>2 .<ssssss>the room .<ssssss>i think the room be in the process of renovation .<ssssss>and they really do need it .<ssssss>2006 may well be a better year to visit than 2005 , when the room may well have reach they post-opening -lrb- 1992 -rrb- nadir .<ssssss>3 .<ssssss>the pool .<ssssss>tiny , over-busy , full of kid .<ssssss>not enough sun lounger by a mile .<ssssss>4 .<ssssss>the cost .<ssssss>not just of the room , but of the million and one overpriced extra that be the hallmark of luxury american chain hotel .<ssssss>as a result , the prevail feeling all around be of money , not style or class .<ssssss>5 .<ssssss>the alternative .<ssssss>hotel neri for example be fabulous and capture the essence of barcelona perfectly .<ssssss>on the plus side , the hotel be still clearly very , very good .<ssssss>the view from the higher floor be pretty spectacular .<ssssss>food at arola be excellent .<ssssss>agua restaurant on the beach be a great place for sunday lunch .<ssssss>and restaruant barceloneta in nearby -lrb- and walkable -rrb- barceloneta be probably the best seafood place in town .<ssssss>i would not go back , but i be still happy enough that i go , if you know what i mean .<ssssss>
3 5 4 5 5 3 4 3		old school toiletries i rate the seattle sheraton somewhere between 3 and 3.5 star base on 3 critique .<ssssss>but first , the pro : * i make this booking on hotwire , and get a fabulous rate -lrb- ~ $ 120 for a fri. and sit .<ssssss>in late oct. this be a smash deal consider you be right smack dab in the heart of seattle .<ssssss>if you be a tourist and hate to drive , you can be drop off by taxi and not need a car for the rest of you trip -lrb- you can walk to everything in the downtown core , and at any given moment , there be several thousand taxi swarm around the place -rrb- .<ssssss>* the staff be perfectly adequate , and actually quite pleasant .<ssssss>* we have breakfast at the hotel restaurant , the daily grill .<ssssss>as at most hotel restaurant , they will stick it to you with inflated price .<ssssss>however , the continental breakfast buffet @ $ 11.95 be a good deal .<ssssss>it might sound gross , but if you fill up on oatmeal and smoked salmon , you can probably skip lunch and splurge on dinner!now , those 3 criticism , one of they admittedly incredibly petty : * my mom and i have to schlepp we own bag up to we -lrb- smoking -rrb- room .<ssssss>this be one of seattle 's largest hotel , especially after they renovate and build a 2nd tower .<ssssss>you be tell I that they do not have enough bell staff , especially the friday night before a uw home game ?<ssssss>even if you be short-staffed , you tell the guest to check in and that they luggage will catch up to they eventually .<ssssss>you do not blithely look in the other direction and let the guest awkwardly corral they own bag .<ssssss>boo .<ssssss>minus star .<ssssss>* the first room we be assign reek of smoke .<ssssss>i know , i know -- the whole property be non-smoking ; they can not help it if a few jerk -- err , i mean , die-hard smoker -- flaunt the rule and stink up the place .<ssssss>anyway , we ask for a new room and be move promptly .<ssssss>* my last complaint be really , really petty .<ssssss>i know sheraton be a starwood chain , and i fondly remember stay at a w a few year ago and ransack they aveda toiletries .<ssssss>-lrb- i mean , i practically abscond with my weight in tiny aveda bottle . -rrb-<ssssss>so , imagine my puzzlement to discover vaseline-brand body lotion in the bathroom !<ssssss>-lrb- the rusk shampoo and conditioner be nice , but still -- i love aveda . -rrb-<ssssss>so , to summarize , if you can get a scream good deal on hotwire or wherever , by all mean book/stay at the seattle sheraton .<ssssss>i highly recommend it -- if you can not get a better rate at the westin or hyatt .<ssssss>otherwise , it be a perfectly adequate venue .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 2 2 2 -1		do not deserve it be five-star rating .<ssssss>i be not someone who usually complain , but the hotel majestic manage to defeat even my stoic british spirit.upon arrival , we be ignore as we repeatedly try to get the receptionist 's attention.when we be finally show to we room on the seventh floor , it be dark , dingy , and slightly dirty in part .<ssssss>the small window be directly opposite another room 's window , which be a mere two metre away , and allow minimal light through as we view be block by wall , drain pipe and gutter .<ssssss>the wall be extremely thin , mean we could hear every noise the rather passionate couple next door to we be making.the toiletries bring my partner out in a rash , and the bathrobe be so coarse they aggravate my eczema .<ssssss>we shower keep switching between scalding hot and freezing cold , and the lavatory keep blocking .<ssssss>we have request a double room , but be meet with two -lrb- fairly lumpy -rrb- single bed .<ssssss>we be tell to merely ` push the bed together ' , and deal with it .<ssssss>have i not pay over Â£200 a night , i probably would not have mind so much , but as it be , it do not seem appropriate 5 - star behaviour.the final icing on the - frankly , rather rotten - cake be that the pool and sun terrace be close .<ssssss>with such a major part of the hotel out of service , one would expect there to be some notification on the website , and to be remind of this at check in .<ssssss>however , i have scour the website and find no such notification , and be certainly not notify of it at reception .<ssssss>instead , guest be inform of the pool 's closure via a small , slightly dog-eared sign in the elevators.my advice to any potential guest of the hotel majestic be this-don ' t let you holiday be ruin - find somewhere else !!!<ssssss>
1 2 3 -1 4 -1 1 -1		i just do not get this hotel - so terrible i just get back from this hotel today feb 1st 2005 after stay there for 6 night .<ssssss>i try to be as objective as possible so that you guy will find the fact not my opinion.i have stay in amerisuite , comfort inn , all the way to ritz carlton or other high-end hotel chain .<ssssss>although i have never stay in a european base hotel , so there be the flaw in my comparison.here be the fact that i find this hotel be lack :1 .<ssssss>no refrigerator , microwave , or even coffee maker .<ssssss>if you need coffee in the morning , the hotel restaurant downstair will conveniently pour it for you for a small fee of $ 2.16 a cup -lrb- no refill , nice try -rrb- .<ssssss>this might be ok for some traveler .<ssssss>but when you have small child this can be a quite inconvenience .<ssssss>forget warm milk ... 2 .<ssssss>they welcome booklet say : tap water be not drinkable .<ssssss>they do provide a minibar with a bottle water that cost about $ 3.00 -lrb- small one -rrb- .3 .<ssssss>no iron - but they do have a dry cleaning service sheet that i will not even dare to see how much it would cost .4 .<ssssss>if you be lucky to stay on 5,7,9 th floor you can get to the ice machine on the same floor .<ssssss>otherwise , you need to wait about 2-3 minute on the elevator just to get the ice .5 .<ssssss>yes sometimes the elevator do take 3-4 minute to arrive at certain time of the day -lrb- check out time , breakfast , and dinner time -rrb- .<ssssss>even the cleaning lady want to get a piece of the action by crowd the guest elevator too .6 .<ssssss>no lotion in the bathroom .<ssssss>yes , i realize a lot of hotel chain do not give out lotion , but if they call themselves resort - i expect a small bottle of lotion can come in handy especially after a day under the sun .7 .<ssssss>the room look old .<ssssss>this might be subjective , but it do look wear out to I .<ssssss>8 .<ssssss>oh , if you pay more they do give you a nicer room with balcony -lrb- i have that -rrb- .<ssssss>here be the lack part : you neighbor can jump out easily from he balcony to you balcony .<ssssss>there be a divide wall about waist high .<ssssss>just enough to hide you head if you sit down - no privacy at all .<ssssss>9 .<ssssss>related to # 8 - the balcony door from the room stick and do not lock .<ssssss>now , what be stop a criminal from the other room to enter you room ?<ssssss>perhaps not much .<ssssss>oh , but the sunrise , sunset , and the full moon be beautiful from the balcony .10 .<ssssss>pool towel - make sure you ask for 4 towel card if you be go to need 4 towel at the pool .<ssssss>otherwise , the pool tower ` personnel ' will give you a hard time for ask more towel than you towel card , as if you be go to steal they prize towel .11 .<ssssss>speaking of towel - so many clean towel that i have get stain on it .<ssssss>i do not even want to think what the stain be from .<ssssss>just close my eye and use they .12 .<ssssss>to be fair , some employee be nice , some need a lesson in cutomer relation -lrb- pool towel personnel include -rrb- .<ssssss>the receptionist with red glass be nice , the other older one - get a major pm .13 .<ssssss>you can not check out before you room be completely empty .<ssssss>i just never have that experience .<ssssss>i always check out a bit earlier while my wife be finish up with the kid .<ssssss>i be confuse ... those be fact .<ssssss>i can not prevent myself from be sarcastic a bit after how they treat we .<ssssss>i just do not get they philosophy .<ssssss>they call themselves a resort , but they be operate a cheap level that i have never see before even compare to a budget motel .<ssssss>at the same time they pride themselves with they excellent restaurant service -lrb- with overprice everything -rrb- .<ssssss>i try they food - mediocre .<ssssss>not worth spend $ 25/person .<ssssss>here be the greatest thing we find about 2 block south of the hotel : cafe miga .<ssssss>highly highly recommend .<ssssss>very modest cafe with excellent cuban coffee and espresso , real orange juice , heavenly ham-and-cheese croissant , full hot breakfast all for under $ 9 .<ssssss>do yourself a favor do not fall into the hotel 's hyped buffet .<ssssss>i read the good and bad review about this hotel , and now i believe the bad one .<ssssss>i do not expect a 4 or 5 star when i get in , but this hotel be lower than 2 star in my humble opinion .<ssssss>sorry , i have to give my opinion at the end ...<ssssss>

2 2 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		convenitent to airport , overprice , noisy room the radisson be convenient to the airport .<ssssss>desk staff be clueless when we ask for recommendation for fine dining .<ssssss>management should provide they with list of restaurant , menu drive direction .<ssssss>ac in room be unbearably noisy .<ssssss>could not hear tv when it come on wake we up several time during the night .<ssssss>notice that there be a number of other national chain suite hotel nearby for less $ with breakfast , a nice convenience if you have a early flight to catch .<ssssss>

5 3 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		daughter 's 20th birthday present my daughter and i stay here for she 20th birthday .<ssssss>we have stay a week on the big island and then come here for 4 day .<ssssss>we love the hotel .<ssssss>again it be at the end of the strip and right by the ocean and beach .<ssssss>we room be clean and beautiful with the most gorgeous view of the water and of the mountain .<ssssss>we request the front building as i get this tip from this site .<ssssss>we watch the surfer every day from the balcony .<ssssss>we have no problem with the elevator .<ssssss>we do eat one night at the pool restaurant which have the best fish taco .<ssssss>there be live music and to sit outside on a spring night be wonderful .<ssssss>we watch the people on the street and the palm sway in the breeze by the ocean .<ssssss>we walk everyday in the park nearby and we be even fortunate enough to have a craft fair that week-end .<ssssss>we walk to the aquarium only 5 minute away and the view of diamond head be great on the walk .<ssssss>one thing i do get miff about be when i check in i tell the front desk clerk that i have a 11 pm flight out and i be ask about a late check out or 1/2 day rental as i do not know what to do till 11pm .<ssssss>she do not help at all the the cost of 1/2 day be too much and not much time .<ssssss>so i solve the problem by take a full day tour of the island with my daughter that start at 8 am and end at 6pm .<ssssss>-lrb- it be a great tour -rrb- when the bell man come to store we bag i casually mention the i have a late flight and he say no problem that the marriott have a courtesy room with shower and a tv and to just keep my room key and i could come back after the tour and get fresh clothes from we luggage and take a shower and then off to the airport .<ssssss>this really help we out .<ssssss>but i can not believe that the front desk do not offer this solution !<ssssss>needless to say he get a big tip !<ssssss>and here be another tip .<ssssss>the airport be super crowd with late flight and you have to go through a agriculture security and regular security so do plan to leave extra early!we love eating at the tiki restaurant and see the most beautiful sunset there .<ssssss>we eat there 3 x. the food be just great and it be so close , just on the corner above wolfgang .<ssssss>it be so good .<ssssss>try the bread pudding serve in a coconut shell and you will just love it !<ssssss>the wait staff be so nice .<ssssss>this be a great hotel in a great location with beautiful room and great view .<ssssss>

mine stay at the bahia principe punta cana at the same time and love it !!!<ssssss>i will not be back to punta cana for a long time ... but if i decide to go ... i would spend a extra few hundred buck for a 5 star resort ... like the bahia !!<ssssss>i never complain ever !!!<ssssss>i n fact before go on this vacation i make fun of all the people with they little complaint say they be high maitenence ... but now i understand ... it be not one little thing it be all the little thing every single day that add up to a major thing by the end of the vacation !!!!!<ssssss>well at least if

4 5 4 5 5 3 3 3		great location a friend recommend this hotel , i be really glad she do .<ssssss>the hotel be in a excellent location and feel really safe .<ssssss>100m from the arc de triumph .<ssssss>the lift be really small and as there be 5 of we the kid usually run up the stair .<ssssss>we have two room the front room have a balcony over look the arc .<ssssss>the other room look onto a court yard .<ssssss>spotless bathroom .<ssssss>really warm and cosy in winter .<ssssss>we all have breakfast each morning which be ample at the hotel .<ssssss>work out at Â£50 each per night , really reasonable<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 4 5 4 1		excellent stay just back from 4 day in nyc and would recommend the helmsley to all .<ssssss>i travel alone and it be my first time in nyc and the helmsley be in a great central location .<ssssss>check in and check out be easy and efficient and my room be large and comfortable .<ssssss>the best thing be the location and the security - which be great when you be a lone female traveller .<ssssss>security at night be very good .<ssssss>the decor be a little dated but the location be fab - walk distance to everything and the subway be very near.the only downside be the housekeeping staff .<ssssss>i be wake up twice before 9am by housekeeping try to get in and clean my room even though there be a do not disturb sign on my door .<ssssss>9am be just too early !!!<ssssss>.<ssssss>my breakfast order be wrong aswell but it be notice very soon .<ssssss>i be ok with the taking of the deposit but for other traveller please be warn about this and this be not normal practice in ireland .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 4 1 1 -1		so so ... .<ssssss>i be there last week , and the start of we stay be not a good one .<ssssss>david , one of the front desk clerk be the person to check we in , and i feel that he be extremely rude , as he take we credit card and id , he simply grab it from my boyfriend , and just start typing in the computer-without a word , and then sigh and say what a day .<ssssss>it take roughly 30 or so minute to check we in , and he do not provide one word to we why-finally we get we key .<ssssss>then the killer be , i book we stay within a particular timeframe , since they website be advertise a free digital camera -lrb- along with something else-but i forget -rrb- if you book it during the summer , and another lady tell we , that we do not have that package-but it be not apart of the package-it be simply a incentive to stay during they low season , so i be a little disappointed for the false advertising -lrb- amazingly enough , that incentive be go when i check the website after i get back home !!!! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>everything else about we stay be simply okay ... i feel that there be a strong lack of hospitality from the staff , but that be make up from the local ... i really love my vacation besides the fact that we stay somewhere that lack the basics of hospitality and integrity-but they housekeeper be amazing if that be any consolation !<ssssss>
2 2 4 5 5 2 1 1		expensive but beautiful i like we stay at the hilton because it be beautiful but certainly not because of the staff or rediculous price .<ssssss>i find one doorman to be very nice , the other would sit and count they tip infront of we , flag we down a cab and then expect a tip and give we dirty look when he didnt recieve one .<ssssss>i also find that the food they be rediculously expensive if you even touch one on the food item in the dresser it be a automatic charge , which be not right especially since a chocolate bar be $ 8 .<ssssss>we also didnt want to pay for the drink in we fridge because a can of pop be $ 4 for a can of pop .<ssssss>we purchase we own drink at a drug store and put they in the fridge after take the other drink out .<ssssss>later that night a employee come to we room to tell we that we have to take we drink out of the fridge and put theirs back where they come from in exact order or we would be charge for every drink in the fridge , arent we pay enough to stay here as it be , we cant even have a cold drink unless we pay a hugely overpriced amount for one drink !<ssssss>they also tell we that we could have a fridge bring up to the room for a additional $ 100 to store out own drink in , ya right .<ssssss>anyways i be dissappoint with the hotel .<ssssss>although it be beautiful i will not go back .<ssssss>
3 1 4 -1 4 -1 3 -1		nice location but a bit gaudy we stay at the berninus on the last night of we tour of tuscany and be a bit disapointed .<ssssss>we figure we would splurge a bit for we last night but i do not think we get we money 's worth .<ssssss>the hotel be undeniably in a great location , right off the piazza della signora .<ssssss>we room be comfortable but somehow we expect more from a five -lrb- or four depend which web site you look at -- they claim to be 5 star -rrb- star hotel .<ssssss>the decor be very overdo -- unless you like everything cover in gold leaf -- and then you will feel right at home .<ssssss>the photo show the hotel on expedia must be old because the hotel do not quite look like the picture .<ssssss>the breakfast room be really lovely , as be the breakfast -- until we find out at checkout that it cost 30 euro for the two of we -- even though we be tell the breakfast be include when check in .<ssssss>overall -- the location be great but the hotel be not worth the price .<ssssss>
4 3 5 3 5 5 4 3		the leonardo da vinci hotel be really nice .<ssssss>leonardo da vinci hotel be very nice .<ssssss>we have room 123 which be huge and the bathroom be huge too .<ssssss>enormous bed but quite hard .<ssssss>i think this be quite common in italy .<ssssss>we be very near the track of the smn railiway station , but the noise be minimal as the window be close , against mosquito !!!<ssssss>we be disappoint that there be not any outdoor space to sit and chat to other quest or just to read a book .<ssssss>jessica and eloise be lovely on the front desk , so be the young man and and the other lady who be name i do not take .<ssssss>she book we for the uffizi and the accademia .<ssssss>also do not forget to book a tour on a accidental tourist trip .<ssssss>we go on one for half a day and we taste , olive oil and 5 wine , it be fantastic .<ssssss>also do not miss the bellagio musem and see wonderf ul donatello sculpture and sculpture by ma .<ssssss>.<ssssss>personally i would not bother with the uffizi .<ssssss>total chaos and nothing in english unlike the accademia and bellagio .<ssssss>if anyone find the room at the uffizi where the caravaggio painting be please let I know .<ssssss>they be suppose to be in room 23 but that room do not exist .<ssssss>the breakfast at the hotel be fine apart from the fruit cocktail , no fresh fruit .<ssssss>the roll and be fine though .<ssssss>croissant not like french one , a bit on the hard side and the machine for tea -lrb- hot water -rrb- and coffee be disgusting , the fruit juice seem like squash to I .<ssssss>we book through -lsb- -- -rsb- and it would be cheaper to book direct .<ssssss>i would not return to this hotel as it be a bit of a hike from the centre .<ssssss>i hope i have not bore you .<ssssss>florence be wonderful .<ssssss>we do not have dinner at the hotel , why would you with so many fabulous restaurant and trattoria about .<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 2 3 3 -1		ok my girlfriend and i stay at the acacia in mid may of 2008 .<ssssss>it be we first trip to puerto rico although we have friend who highly advise that we go there .<ssssss>we be happy that we stay at the acacia because of the price and end result , but it be not perfect by any means .<ssssss>issue # 1 - when we arrive on saturday night , felix check we in to we room , 105 .<ssssss>the next day , my credit card company call I with a fraud alert say that they have give approval to bill my account to this same place twice -lrb- i bring this to the attention of the front desk and we have that fix -rrb- .<ssssss>after we vacation i notice on my credit card statement that i be indeed charge twice for my room , even after we address this with the front desk .<ssssss>i be sure a mistake , but it seem that it could have be avoided.issue # 2 - the first room we be give be 105 , on the first floor , behind the front desk .<ssssss>do not stay in this room .<ssssss>it be spacious enough , but only have 1 window that be in the bathroom and look up to the parking lot behind the building .<ssssss>there be no natural light in this room .<ssssss>also , it be close to the restaurant kitchen so you hear the wait staff until the kitchen close .<ssssss>-lrb- though , the food in the restaurant be delicious . -rrb-<ssssss>the biggest problem with room 105 be that , during the night the a/c be drip inside the room -lrb- because it be not a window unit -rrb- .<ssssss>in the morning we realize what happen and look at the wall where the water be drip and see a lot of mold .<ssssss>it be apparent that it be not the first time that happen and be most likely know before we be give the room -lrb- there be a bucket behind the couch by the wall mean to catch the water from the a/c -rrb- .<ssssss>anyway , the next day , the staff give we a new room with a balcony and nice view , so that make up for it .<ssssss>issue # 3 - there be no parking on the street for the acacia .<ssssss>when make a reservation , try to get a spot in the wind chime parking lot .<ssssss>if you can not , you will be parking a couple block away .<ssssss>-lrb- my rental be perfectly safe , but i do see a couple car along the same street with window break so that be in the back of my mind -rrb- positive : the beach be a few step out the door and have great surf .<ssssss>breakfast at the wind chime be good and free i think -lrb- do not have the milk though -rrb- on we first night , freddie -lrb- restaurant manager -rrb- drive we to bebo 's because they kitchen have already close .<ssssss>thanks !<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 3 1 1 -1		great location but otherwise disappointing have read earlier trip advisor review in relation to this hotel , it be with some hesitation that i make a reservation .<ssssss>on balance , my opinion be that most of the criticism be valid , albeit that some of they be relatively trivial .<ssssss>the hotel building be magnificent and the public area beautifully decorate .<ssssss>although clean , the bedroom decoration be less stylish and a little tired .<ssssss>the bed linen be wear and there be only one dress gown for two people .<ssssss>it could not be say that there be anything like the attention to detail that be usually associate with boutique hotel .<ssssss>without doubt the most disappointing feature of the hotel be the service .<ssssss>aside from one chap , the staff be at best unhelpful and at worst rude .<ssssss>they certainly do not consider it within they remit to answer question about sightseeing , local amenity , etc. a particularly memorable instance be that we want to package a fragile article in order to transport it home .<ssssss>in answer to we request for advice , the receptionist simply say that they do not know .<ssssss>no effort be make to give consideration to the request , let alone make enquiry .<ssssss>we eventually find a shop specialising in packaging just a couple of minute down the street.on the morning of we departure , the restaurant be 45 minute late in open for breakfast which mean that we be unable to take a meal that we have pay for .<ssssss>my request for a partial refund be treat with derision .<ssssss>the hotel 's greatest advantage be its location on a relatively quiet street and within 15 minute -lrb- safe -rrb- walk of a wide range of excellent restaurant .<ssssss>take everything into consideration , i would not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 2 2 1		danger , this hotel will ruin you day .<ssssss>this facility have one thing go for it .<ssssss>palmas del mar be a beautiful place .<ssssss>the hotel be a nightmare .<ssssss>3 room in 18 hours.an electrical problem in a room with a bad odor .<ssssss>a plumbing problem in a suite with a safe that i have to fix.finally a room that be boarder line ok .<ssssss>room where dungeonlike , uncomfortable bed , old bathroom and tear and wornout rug .<ssssss>very poor service at the restaurant .<ssssss>we be serve yogurt that be 3 week expire .<ssssss>the front desk know nothing about the area which be load with thing to do .<ssssss>the pool be nothing like its description .<ssssss>stay away from this property .<ssssss>
2 3 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		disappointed we come to holland to pick up a puppy .<ssssss>we get write approval before hand to have we puppy stay at the hotel , but once we arrive they tell we dog be not allow .<ssssss>also , we arrive early and after a ten hour flight they would not let we have a room even if we pay extra , so we stay in the wait area for five hour before anyone would alow we we room and get some sleep .<ssssss>so we trip start off right away on the wrong foot .<ssssss>the room be small and have no ac , on top of that the day time temp .<ssssss>be run 90 degree .<ssssss>the only place we have to get cool be in the resturant or wait area .<ssssss>the food be good and the hotel be fairly clean , but once we first three day be up we go to get we pup and never come back .<ssssss>the little hotel in the country have much better food , service and much larger room for a lot less money .<ssssss>the new hotel be dog friendly and we could even take we pup into they fancy french resturant .<ssssss>there be a lot of people there with dog and make we stay so much more enjoyable!watch out for pick pocket around this area !!!<ssssss>
4 2 5 4 2 2 4 -1		overall a very good hotel i agree with the accuracy of the previous reviews.an excellent hotel , good not to be in the centre of a very noisy city and it only take we 15-20 min to stroll in to the centre of barcelona .<ssssss>on the positive side -lrb- with the exception of bag service see below -rrb- the staff be excellent .<ssssss>the bathroom be superbon the negative side the mini bar price be astounding-but be not they always and it be a good party game with you wife how much do you think they want for a bottle of water ?<ssssss>the bag delivery service to the room be appalling-45 min still no bag and we be late for a meeting in the hotel i have to change for .<ssssss>it take 2 phone call and a trip to reception to extract we bag if you have a spare 30 minute learn how to use the light switch and do not do what we do and by mistake press the privacy switch which mean no room change the next day !<ssssss>
5 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great place for all !<ssssss>my family and i just return from a two-week holiday at the iberostar punta cana .<ssssss>i fly out of jfk on a non-stop american airline flight .<ssssss>it be great !<ssssss>the plane be not crowd .<ssssss>i travel with my husband and two child age 2.4 and 1.1 year .<ssssss>both child do not get much sleep the night before .<ssssss>they both fall asleep about one hour into the flight .<ssssss>lucky I !<ssssss>the plane arrive half hour early at 11:00 a.m. once you exit the plane the hot and humid air hit you right in the face !<ssssss>it be a smooth exit from the airport .<ssssss>i be one step ahead of the game because i purchase my tourist card at the consulate in new york and have they already fill out .<ssssss>i head straight for custom .<ssssss>my bag come right away .<ssssss>i do not have ground transportation to and from the airport .<ssssss>i be tell you can grab a cab as soon as you exit .<ssssss>the advice be correct.i have a air-conditioned van for $ 24 usd .<ssssss>the ride to the hotel be a little scary .<ssssss>however , i wasnâ€™t surprise because the road be similar to my grandparent city of coamo , puerto rico .<ssssss>go towards the hotel in pc there be two lane .<ssssss>one go and the other come .<ssssss>if you want to pass the very slow move vehicle in front you would have to go into the oncoming traffic lane to pass the vehicle .<ssssss>this be scary .<ssssss>however the dominican be use to drive like this so i wasnâ€™t concern .<ssssss>i be also not surprise on how some of the poor people live .<ssssss>the housing be call shanty-towns â€œMake shift homesâ€ ?<ssssss>i be familiar with this because i travel to rio and the poor people live like the same .<ssssss>well to get off the subject and on to the hotel.of course there be only one person at the reception and he last name happen to be ruiz which be my mother last name .<ssssss>he speak english but i speak in spanish .<ssssss>i give the guy $ 30 to upgrade I to a junior suite .<ssssss>i could have give he less because he didnâ€™t even ask for money .<ssssss>the junior suite be nice but it be not conveniently located .<ssssss>the junior suite be located near the front entrance of the property .<ssssss>the front entrance be close to the buffet and japanese restaurant .<ssssss>the suite have double or king size bed with a small table and chair a sofa and a very nice bathroom with a big tub .<ssssss>the downside of this location be that it be a far walk to the pool and beach .<ssssss>not a big deal if i be marry with no kid .<ssssss>but shelp beach stuff with two kid in toe be difficult .<ssssss>the same day i go to the front desk and ask to speak with the manager .<ssssss>the managerâ€™s name be mr. coleman .<ssssss>he be a very nice gentleman and have a way with word !<ssssss>i guess that be why he manageâ€™s all three hotel punta cana , dominicana , and bavaro .<ssssss>i ask if there be anyway he can get I a standard room closer to the beach .<ssssss>he pleasantly advise to come and see he the next day around 2:00 p.m. and he will see what he can do .<ssssss>well patience pay off because he give we a family suite !<ssssss>the family suite be locate on the second floor hop skip and jump from the pool area.the suite be two room .<ssssss>the first have a king size bed , sofa bed , tv and bathroom .<ssssss>the other connect room have two double bed w / a tv .<ssssss>both room have a patio with table and two chair .<ssssss>it be really nice .<ssssss>i also ask for a crib it be clean and it serve the purpose .<ssssss>the decore be a little outdated but the room serve the purpose .<ssssss>pool beach foodthere be two pool side by side one for dominicana and the other for punta cana .<ssssss>they be a good size but would have like a bigger pool .<ssssss>but then again who go to the carribean to sit in a pool .<ssssss>the sun be strong to the pool water get warm .<ssssss>there be a lot of space for kid to place .<ssssss>there be also a baby pool .<ssssss>the pool be keep very clean .<ssssss>the first week of arrival be not crowd so i do not need to reserve a sun shade .<ssssss>as the week past i find i have to wake up in the morning for the prime spot .<ssssss>only because i have kid .<ssssss>the beach be absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>this be where i spend my entire vacation .<ssssss>i set up shop on the first row of hut .<ssssss>so i be two step from the pool and two step from the beach and right between the beach buffet !<ssssss>the front of the dominicana pool be the activity side .<ssssss>they have lot of game provide by the wonderful star friend .<ssssss>i dance merengue and my 2 year old sun do too !<ssssss>the ice cream at the la cana be way better than the la yola icecream stand .<ssssss>the la cana have rotisseree chicken that be great better than the other buffet .<ssssss>but the buffet near the dominicana have frenchfry with

4 4 4 5 5 2 4 -1		great location , we will stay there again a friend recommend this hotel and we be not dissappointed .<ssssss>great location and easy access to public transportation .<ssssss>we room have a great view , be spacious , the bed be comfortable , and the japanese style bathtub be fantastic to soak in after a day of climb all those hill .<ssssss>the attach restaurant be pricey but the breakfast be good .<ssssss>we only complaint be minor one : when we arrive no one seem interested in help we with we baggage and the room decor seem to be a stranage mishmash of asian and western style decor , but that be just be picky .<ssssss>try to get a room with a view , and take advanatage of that deep japanese style soak tub .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 3 5		great for everyone !<ssssss>book this hotel through hotelconnect.co.uk which have the best price at the time and include breakfast - a lot of the deal from other site do not include breakfast.the hotel be fantastic !!<ssssss>in a great location , right at the flower market which be great for gift and there be shop there that you can get a strippenkaart -lrb- for the tram - the little tobacconist be great because they will show you how to use it -rrb- .<ssssss>also , just along from the hotel be the rembrantplein which be a great area for pub and restaurant if you be want to avoid busy crowd but still enjoy yourself.the hotel itself be such a surprise to I .<ssssss>the room we be in be really big and the bathroom be lovely .<ssssss>the lift always work !<ssssss>which be great because my mum be disabled and we really need that.the staff be probably the worst point , very snooty .<ssssss>the porter only help you on arrival if you look like you be a tipper , the reception staff be ok but could be a little more helpful .<ssssss>they can be rather frosty .<ssssss>

1 4 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		very unfortunate experience well , i do not actually get to stay at the hotel .<ssssss>i come there with 2 of my girlfriend for a 3-day weekend , and we end up stay there for about a hour and leave for a hotel in the downtown , same price , better service and much better location -lrb- hotel abigail -rrb- .<ssssss>it all start with notice the gap in the doorway , even when the door be close .<ssssss>the only way to keep it tightly shut would be to hold it in place with some heavy furniture -lrb- that be convenient ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>then we realize we have no towel and 3 wet -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>washcloth .<ssssss>the room be freezing , which lead we to discover the third surprize : the heater lack its cover , so the coil be expose and just stick out of the wall .<ssssss>the management refuse to move we to another room say there be none available -lrb- they then rent out one room to another man who ask for it while we be still in the office -rrb- .<ssssss>so , when we be feed up with the surprize , we make call to other hotel and reserve a room in the above mention hotel .<ssssss>the management/office person be unbelievably rude and obnoxious , and believe I , i have see some obnoxious people be a social worker .<ssssss>you just do not expect to see that in the customer service .<ssssss>he refuse to hear about we complaint and basicaly yell at we .<ssssss>awful experience for we , but if you absolutely must stay there , check it out for yourself , may be you will have it good ... we be a lot happier stay downtown , pay the same price , have better service and just be treat like human .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 5 4 -1		in major need of upgrade my husband and i recently return from a trip to hotel de l'eau vive .<ssssss>a quick review of the positive : friendly front desk staff who be very helpful ; close to the french quarter ; canal street mall , harrah 's , riverfront - we walk everywhere -lrb- do not bother rent a car - parking be very expensive -rrb- .<ssssss>negative : the bathroom be in major need of upgrade .<ssssss>there be a huge jacuzzi -lrb- which sound great -rrb- but not only be the shower located within the jacuzzi , but the surround concrete be crack and moldy .<ssssss>the hotel elevator also could use a tune-up - every time we be in it we joke that we be in the bate motel .<ssssss>this place have a huge amount of potential - the unit have brick wall and there be a lot of character .<ssssss>we spend very little time in we room - basically be just a place to sleep and shower , so it suit we need , but if you be use to finer thing , look elsewhere .<ssssss>

3 3 2 -1 2 -1 4 -1		nice on the surface !<ssssss>service - great , the staff do they best to make you stay enjoyable.rooms - average but do not look too closely .<ssssss>if you do , you will notice low quality linen , dirty mattress , musty smell pillow and beach towel and bug .<ssssss>more specifically , we be quite shocked one night to discover a rather large cockroach in the bathroom .<ssssss>tip : keep the plug in the sink and tub drains.beach - the best feature of the property.food - okay , we always find something to eat but if you like beef or pork you will be disappointed.entertainment - if you be easily entertain you will find it acceptable.overall quality - definitely a 4 star hotel .<ssssss>if you really want a true 5 star you should stay at the palace next door.overall experience - we do not regret go but will not likely return .<ssssss>it be just a little lack luster .<ssssss>if you go without high expectation and just want to enjoy the sun , the ocean and get lose in a book in a grove of coconut palm you will have a good time.the worst thing - the dirty pool towel , low quality linen and the musty smell in the rooms.the best thing - the beach .<ssssss>

5 4 5 5 5 3 3 3		great experience and would go back in a heart beat !<ssssss>this be my second time stay at this hotel and i would stay again in a heart beat .<ssssss>we be assign to the 13th residence which be closest to the water -lrb- without a view -rrb- but far from the main dining hall -lrb- nice to avoid the night time noise and traffic -rrb- .<ssssss>we go to the buffet for breakfast lunch and dinner most of the time .<ssssss>we attempt the steak house one night , be disappointed and go back to the buffet -lrb- which we love -rrb- .<ssssss>we attempt the pool bar , but again go back to the buffet .<ssssss>the variety of the food be fantastic and we be never diappoint with anything we try .<ssssss>service in the dining hall be so-so , but if you sit outside at night , it be wonderful ... .<ssssss>it be a smoking section , but we be not bother by it .<ssssss>the beer be amazing !!!<ssssss>always cold .<ssssss>if you be a wine person , you will likely be disappointed -lrb- although we discover a gem on we last night there - a fantatic wine shop !!!!<ssssss>you take the free bus to the real plaza shop and it be located immediately to you right when you enter the outdoor plaza - it be a bar/wine shop -rrb- .<ssssss>we usually leave singles for tip on the dining table , but likely would save it for bartender and chambermaid next time , because you never really know who pick up the tip .<ssssss>the bar late at night can always make change for a 20 .<ssssss>internet be expensive and slow .<ssssss>bring you own laptop and use wireless be cheaper - if you need to do work.we experienced loss of power 3 time while we be there .<ssssss>twice during the day -lrb- we be at the beach and do not care -rrb- .<ssssss>the third be later at night from 11pm - 1am .<ssssss>again , we do not care .<ssssss>there be the occassional sewer smell - it be a waff but never stay .<ssssss>we do not find this bothersome - in fact we giggle about it as it be between the residence of 11 and 12 .<ssssss>it never make it to 13 .<ssssss>the beach be fantastic .<ssssss>you can sunbathe , swim and hang out all day without be bother .<ssssss>the security be always present keep peddler away from the tourist .<ssssss>a peddler come through now and again .<ssssss>but bring little attention to themselves.this hotel be spotless .<ssssss>the attendant manicure 24/7 from the beach to the room , everything be spotless .<ssssss>we do a couple of excursion , but most of the time spend the day on the beach , happy .<ssssss>a couple of hint : if you do not eat you weight in fruit at home , it be likely not a good idea to start on vacation .<ssssss>my boyfriend fall in love with the fresh fruit and live to regret the copious amount he eat in the first 4 day .<ssssss>we make coffee in we room every morning , we use the tap water and do not have a bad experience ... although i do not reccomend it .<ssssss>bring a lot of suntan lotion - it be expensive to buy it on the resort.great time , well worth the money .<ssssss>
3 1 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		el con ; the good the bad and the other ... i just get back from a four night trip to el conquistador.i have read a lot of review before my trip and have experience this hotel , i can say that i agree with both the negative and positive .<ssssss>i will start with the positive .<ssssss>the view be beautiful .<ssssss>the garden be very well maintain .<ssssss>most of the staff be extremely attentive and helpful .<ssssss>we have we shower and toilet fix very quickly .<ssssss>the island be the place to be , there be hike path to quiet and private beach on the other side of the island .<ssssss>i would like to recommend balyhoo restaurant and stingray cafe , both place have good food and good drink , they be also by the water .<ssssss>and now the negative .<ssssss>i read all the review that talk about the price of food .<ssssss>yes , $ 3.50 for a 16 ounce bottle of water in the palomino island cafe be much but what about pay $ 3.25 for a wall st journal?or $ 20 for a one way cab trip to a restaurant 7 minute away from the resort ?<ssssss>not to mention caribe restaurant -lrb- which my girlfriend name jock strap cafe -rrb- where the low qulity of food , high price and terrible service make this place a ultimate no-no .<ssssss>the island 's main beach be very loud and crowded i have to say that this place be not very romantic .<ssssss>there be so many people .<ssssss>so much noise and excitement .<ssssss>it seem like a perfect place for family .<ssssss>there be some exciting action for everybody .<ssssss>even the cute grandma that be leave at the slot machines.they will charge you for everything and the markup of stuff like newspaper , water and other basic thing be outrageous.the room need update ; my tv almost fall because the cabinet be so old .<ssssss>my toilet and shower give I trouble on the first day -lrb- they do fix it right away -rrb- the spa be very good and the service be good as well.i would suggest a visit to el con if you be stay at the village -lrb- which look terrific -rrb- or if you want to go on vacation with you entire family .<ssssss>
2 3 4 4 4 2 2 -1		treat as a second rate guest i book my stay through a lastminute booking site some 7 week ahead of my stay.upon arrival i be greet by a receptionist that could hardly crack a smile , i have book and pay for my stay on my switch debit card , however when i be be attend to i be tell that the hotel could not accept the card for extrasus have request a room on a high floor and think i would be accomodate as i have book ahead , however i be give a room on the 1st floor , room 106 .<ssssss>the room be dark with very limited natural light , the view be of air conditioning vent , i phone down to reception to ask if i could possibly have a different room to be tell abruptly the hotel be full.this be the second time i have stay here , the first time i stay in february 2006 i again have a dark room on the 1st floor , room 101 with the same view.the breakfast rate be scandalous , how any hotel can justify Â£18 for a breakfast + Â£3 for a glass of fruit juice be beyond my comprehension , my tip be to take the walk around the corner to the weatherspoon public house the liberty bound where a full hearty breakfast with coffee be Â£4it would appear that if you book a room through certain website it give the hotel the opportunity to put you in room that be cold and unwelcoming , the staff seem to be surley and look down on you and be not particulary friendly.on reflection i will not be give the hotel a 3rd chance at take my money , there be better place than this , i stay a 3rd night in london , in greenwich at the devonport house de vere venue , staff be extremely friendly , polite and could not have do anymore to make my stay pleasant and for Â£50 for a double room and breakfast in cultural greenwich i will return there instead of the city of london apex hotel .<ssssss>

4 4 2 5 5 4 5 4		great hotel , some but ... we stay at 1898 for new year and the week afterwards.it 's a great hotel with many plus point , but there be one or two thing to be aware of , see below.pro 's : - great location , at the top of la rambla within walk distance of many of the main sight include much of the gaudi architecture - casa battlo , casa mila and sagrada familia , also very near la boqueria - a fantastic food market , and close to other great shopping around placa catalunya-impressive building , impressive bedroom and bathroom - all constantly be keep clean - great facility - good gym -lrb- bike , run machine , some weight -rrb- very , very stylish indoor pool with adjacent steam room and sauna , along with spa facitlity .<ssssss>free wi-fus access in the room along with a internet centre on the first floor with a couple of desktop and printer - roof top terrace with outdoor pool - open all year and all evening with great view of the city - this be one of the best thing about the hotel - a real oasis away from the hussle and bussle of la rambla and warm enough in the sun to enjoy at this time of year - many nearby cafe , bakery , wine shop and supermarketscon 's : - and this be the biggest con - room on the second floor at the back of the hotel be noisy .<ssssss>yes , the room be soundproof so you do not really hear noise outside or other guest , but there be a bar and nightclub - bar lobo - in the same building as the hotel .<ssssss>room on the second floor at the back be directly above it be dancefloor and the structure of the building very effectively channel through the sound of the music .<ssssss>bear in mind that the spaniard love to party from midnight to around 4am , and if you be in one of these room , and be noise sensitive , you be go to be keep awake particularly on friday and saturday night .<ssssss>the hotel obviously have complaint about the noise regularly , as when we complain there be a set of stock answer we be give .<ssssss>however on one particularly bad night they do move we to another room to sleep for the night .<ssssss>request a quiet room on one of the higher floor when book .<ssssss>- do not bother ask the front desk for restaurant recommendation - it be not there speciality .<ssssss>a good option for tapa be taller de tapas - they have two restaurant within walk distance of the hotel .<ssssss>for paella , can majo be a good choice on the sea front - 40 min walk or 10 min taxi -lrb- â‚ ?<ssssss>0 -rrb- .<ssssss>- iron and iron board be not available .<ssssss>there be a iron service , but take a travel iron be probably easier .<ssssss>- there be tea and coffee make facility in the room , but no milk .<ssssss>you can get milk in the nearby carrefour supermarket -lrb- also great for buy bottle of cava / rioja -rrb- - â‚ ?<ssssss>8 for breakfast - this be steep if you just want somethinbg small for breakfast .<ssssss>around the back of the hotel -lrb- turn leave past bar lobo -rrb- there be a deli/cafe that the local go to , which serve great pastry and hot chocolate at a fraction of the price .<ssssss>there be also a good bakery if you continue past the back entrance of carrefour.in summary , it be fantastic hotel in a great location , but steer clear of those room on the second floor at the back .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 3 2 2 1		just average the room be clean and comfortable .<ssssss>this be a decent location especially to the accademia museum and train station .<ssssss>breakfast be modest but include and convenient .<ssssss>the interenet be down the entire time and the staff be not able to make any reccommendation or give much direction .<ssssss>they do make we dinner reservation but only to restuaurant name address that we provide .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 3 2 1 -1		watch you bill !<ssssss>as per the other review the location be great , the apartment be big but a little tired but perfectly acceptable .<ssssss>the roof top pool , spa , sauna and fitness room be great too .<ssssss>so what let this place down be the administration .<ssssss>there be three of we in the queue check out and all of we have a dispute on we bill of some form or another .<ssssss>unsure what the first person be dispute but the person in front of I have be charge for mini bar item not consume .<ssssss>they try to charge I for breakfast that be include in my room rate .<ssssss>however , in both case the dispute be settle quickly by recepetion without arguement .<ssssss>however i have now notice a extra charge on my visa card , i call the hotel and they say it be for minus bar , and i definately do not consume any other item other than the one i pay for on departure , they say they would call back but 5 day later still wait guy !<ssssss>now i have to go through the process of dispute the transaction through visa.pro ` slocation , pool spa on the roof top .<ssssss>size of the apartments.con ` sroom a little tired , undergoround parking a bit of a hassle , bed a bit firm , they can not get they charge right and dont follow up on complaints!i would have give above average if they have bother to follow up on my complaint about they bogus minus bar charge .<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 4 3 4 2		the ghetto !!!<ssssss>holiday inn civic centre look nice on the net , however once we arrive we be very disapointed .<ssssss>it smell like cigarrette all throughout the hotel .<ssssss>it be the only hotel that we stay in the whole time i be in the state that actually charge a $ 25 per day fee to park we car in the car park .<ssssss>we be chase out of the restaurant because we do not tip , when the tip policy be if you be happy with you service then please tip and we be not happy so we do not tip .<ssssss>the waitress insist at one point i be eat turkey when it be pink and i know be ham .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the view from the room be not spectacular.the only good thing be the bed be comfy and they have cheap internet access .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i be glad something be cheap .<ssssss>
2 1 4 4 4 2 2 3		we use to love it , but not anymore we use to stay at this hotel as we love the suite , the breakfast in the morning , and location .<ssssss>perfect for a family of 4 .<ssssss>however , thing have change .<ssssss>we most recent stay be a disappointment .<ssssss>we book and pay full price through the hotel website .<ssssss>ask for a 2 bedroom , but none be available .<ssssss>so i ask to be on a wait list , since we book it far in advance .<ssssss>no 2 bedroom available when we arrive , but we could pay for a cot each night , she say .<ssssss>i forget how much it be , but it be over $ 30 a night !<ssssss>i say no thanks .<ssssss>it would have be nice if they have include that , since they know i want a 2 bedroom and be give a 1 bedroom , but oh well .<ssssss>$ 300 night , plus the numerous tax and valet parking ... close to $ 400 a night.the room .<ssssss>sofa bed have nothing on it , and they know we have to use it .<ssssss>i call ahead of time .<ssssss>i call for extra sheet and pillow .<ssssss>they just drop it off and do not offer to help .<ssssss>breakfast be way too busy for the size of the space .<ssssss>this hotel be too big for what it have to offer .<ssssss>they even tell you take you breakfast to you room , as there be not enough space .<ssssss>we have to wait in line for awhile .<ssssss>not the staff 's fault , but the eating area be way too small.valet parking only .<ssssss>$ 30 a day .<ssssss>when we go to get we car , we be tell to go to the desk , not to call ahead , as they have no space to leave you car when they bring it up .<ssssss>there be no parking or stop area at the front of the hotel .<ssssss>so we get we car and it be cover and i mean cover in bird fece .<ssssss>we could not see out of the window , so he turn on the wiper and smear it all across .<ssssss>it be obviously leave under a bird perch or something .<ssssss>it be ridiculous .<ssssss>but he just leave it like that .<ssssss>do not even offer a paper towel or anything .<ssssss>

4 4 4 5 4 3 2 -1		good value for family , but caution advise ... we spend five night at the york at the end of july , and overall have a positive experience .<ssssss>the location be ideal -- within walk distance to the rock and circular quay .<ssssss>we deluxe two bedroom 2 bath on the 21st floor have a decent partial view of the harbor bridge -- a advance request that the hotel staff kindly accommodate .<ssssss>have a kitchen with all the amenity help cut down some of we family 's food budget , at least for breakfast .<ssssss>the room be nicely renovate , though we be not thrill with the choice of art and the extensive use of red in all furnishings .<ssssss>my only real beef be with the staff , who be not rude per se , but also not terribly pleasant or helpful either .<ssssss>you should especially be very very careful before sign you credit card slip at the check-out .<ssssss>they show I my bill , which i examine and say it be fine .<ssssss>subsequently they take my credit card to run it through , hand I the slip and in one breath , ask I to sign .<ssssss>thankfully , by some divine intervention , i look at the amount just before sign it , only to discover to my horror that it be $ 600 over the amount that be on my final bill !<ssssss>the young lady at the desk do not even apologize when i point it out to she .<ssssss>she simply say , oh , let I change that for you .<ssssss>meanwhile i could partly see she co-worker/supervisor in the background watch and listen to what be go on .<ssssss>i will give they the benefit of the doubt and assume that it be not intentional or a organize plot .<ssssss>all i be say be , be careful , and review all charge and total before you sign .<ssssss>otherwise , enjoy the great location and request a higher floor to avoid the noise .<ssssss>
3 2 3 2 5 5 4 -1		overall good , with a few kink the grounds of this resort be beautiful and well-manicured .<ssssss>two pool , both gorgeous , and the beach be serene and peaceful .<ssssss>as soon as we get there , we notice how friendly and hospitable the staff be .<ssssss>always ready to help .<ssssss>we could see iguana , turtle and kous in the pond from we balcony .<ssssss>the room be decent , no big problem but nothing spectacular .<ssssss>the concierge give we good tip on get around -- for example , he tell we when it be more efficient to rent a car and explore on we own and when it be better to take the hotel-guided tour .<ssssss>-lrb- we do both . -rrb-<ssssss>the one drawback i note be the food .<ssssss>my husband 's meal at marbella 's be chewy , stringy shrimp that clearly be not fresh .<ssssss>the waitress graciously take that meal off we bill without we ask she to .<ssssss>we think palio 's -lrb- italian -rrb- would be better , but not so .<ssssss>my meal be largely tasteless and the lobster , again , be chewy and not fresh-tasting .<ssssss>we server be pretty terrible , too .<ssssss>inattentive , slow , pretty much incompetent .<ssssss>the best experience we have with food be outside the resort .<ssssss>one be a takeout stand near el yunque that we absolutely love .<ssssss>all different kind of taco , corn meal stick , fry greasy goodness .<ssssss>and back at the hotel , breakfast at marbella 's be much better than they dinner.i also wish the hotel would prepare its guest more adequately for the tour it offer .<ssssss>we take a kayaking tour to bioluminescent bay and really have no idea what to expect .<ssssss>it turn out great , but a few people bring young child , which be a mistake .<ssssss>a couple of the kid cry and fuss , which be not the most pleasant sound to hear when you be try to enjoy the glowing waterway and appreciate the sound and sight of nature .<ssssss>i think it would be better to discourage family from bring child younger than 12 .<ssssss>the hotel 's on-site car rental be very convenient , so we rent a car for the day to take to old san juan .<ssssss>we have some trouble find we rental car after make the arrangement .<ssssss>oh , it be just down the ramp and to the right really mean you have to go on a scavenger hunt inside the -lrb- dark -rrb- parking garage to find a car you have never see before .<ssssss>we rely on keyless entry for that .<ssssss>then , try to return the car at the end of the day be a hassle .<ssssss>the parking garage entrance be semi-blocked with a full sign .<ssssss>we have to circumvent the hotel twice to figure out where to park the car .<ssssss>we also think we should have be tell that half the restaurant be close .<ssssss>no indication anywhere before or during the trip that we choice be so diminish .<ssssss>after try and fail to reserve a table at the grille room , we be direct to iguana 's pub at the country club and be very impressed with the food , service and atmosphere .<ssssss>i believe this be a case of false advertisement and in that sense , we do not get what we pay for .<ssssss>but , overall , i would say it be a pretty good vacation .<ssssss>puerto rico be a beautiful place to go and the resort have a lot of perk .<ssssss>i do not know if i would return to the rio mar , though .<ssssss>
2 5 2 5 2 5 5 -1		problem solve staff in a bargain of a hotel this hotel have it problem but it be definitely a bargain .<ssssss>the room be a little worn and we first room reak of sewage .<ssssss>the friendly staff move we to another room as quickly as they could .<ssssss>the front desk be very helpful with almost everything .<ssssss>bed be more like boxspring than mattress but i hear many room in beij be like this .<ssssss>if you get a taxi chance be they will not know where the hotel be , but just have they drop you off around the corner at the grand beijing hotel .<ssssss>the forbid city and tianeman square be within easy walk distance and a metro stop be also close .<ssssss>i saw rate as low as $ 40 a night on some web site , make this a can not miss deal .<ssssss>the hotel be book to capacity so book early .<ssssss>this be a solid two and a half star hotel maybe even a three in my book -lrb- on a scale of four -rrb- .<ssssss>this hotel be by no means luxurious or flashy .<ssssss>it be a good decent hotel in a fantastic location .<ssssss>may not be for the finicky or hard to please traveler .<ssssss>my friend be in a deluxe room which be definitley a little nicer than mine .<ssssss>i be extremely pleased with the hotel and bang for buck .<ssssss>

2 1 1 4 1 2 3 -1		forget it !<ssssss>i would not stay here again , particularly for the price we pay which include a 9 % ` hotel service charge ' above and beyond the 9 % gov ' t tax and $ 5pp/night municipal fee .<ssssss>when we ask about the hotel service charge we be tell it be another tax .<ssssss>in that situation we figure , what can we do ?<ssssss>i take a look at the holiday inn express website and they san juan hotel right down the street -lrb- also in condado -rrb- do not have this service fee .<ssssss>we take a look at the hi express while we be in town and the pool be smaller than the sjb 's , but that seem to be the only drawback .<ssssss>and the sjb 's pool get cloudier by the day , as they seem to not be care for it at all.we have to switch room after the 1st night because we tv do not work and you could not adjust the temperature on the bathroom faucet .<ssssss>we new room be only marginally better .<ssssss>and there be one day we come back to no room cleaning after be out of the room the entire day -lrb- 9-5 -rrb- .<ssssss>at that point we just ask for clean towel for we shower when they offer to clean it for we then .<ssssss>the only food available in the hotel be a continental breakfast for a ridiculous $ 7 + tax .<ssssss>the spread be not impressive from the look of it and i could just grab a better breakfast from a local place for much cheaper.all in all , if i go to san juan again i would not stay at the san juan beach .<ssssss>i feel it be way overprice for the service/amenities .<ssssss>

2 4 3 -1 2 -1 2 -1		ummm , okay , i guess ... .<ssssss>maybe okay , so where to start ... ?<ssssss>i can not decide if i like the place or not .<ssssss>but i certainly will not be stay there again .<ssssss>we stay there twice for a couple of day each time in june .<ssssss>the room be certainly cheap enough , and the location be good for get about no while avoid the bourbon street idiot crowd and the much more expensive hotel located near there .<ssssss>the room be also okay in fitout , especially for what we pay .<ssssss>and it be not like they be claim to be much of a hotel.but on the downside make I think i will fork out the little extra and stay somewhere a lot nicer next time.the first time the only thing wrong be the front desk staff .<ssssss>they clearly could not care less about anyone except they phone conversation with they friend , and equally , be not incline to offer anything other than a purely functional ` welcome ' .<ssssss>now , grant , the concept of service in the we be slightly bizaare and far below what you get in many other coutnry , but at this hotel it be just plain bad .<ssssss>good luck get they to honour they ' 100 % gaurantee ' if you dare complain about anything!the room -lrb- on the fourth floor -rrb- be quiet , clean and everything pretty much work as claim .<ssssss>freebie breakfast be okay , although very limited .<ssssss>so far so good .<ssssss>we be glad we check out when we do though because that very morning they water system decide to rupture : water streaming from the ceiling right in front of the ground floor front desk .<ssssss>result : no water that day in any of the room .<ssssss>annoying , but hardly anything you can blame they for as such.second time be less enjoyable .<ssssss>1st floor room should be avoid .<ssssss>refuse , in fact .<ssssss>unless you * like * road noise , drunken people knock on you window and door at three am , and wall paper peel off the wall .<ssssss>and then the toilet flood .<ssssss>i must say , they be very prompt about clean it up .<ssssss>less impressive be they method for cleaning : scoop and mop the water away and then leave .<ssssss>the carpet be soak , the tile in the toilet be unclean and they simply do not use anything to clean except a mop and more water .<ssssss>no disinfectant , no cleaning product at all , no treat the carpet .<ssssss>ick , ick , ick .<ssssss>make I shudder to think what else have happen in the room previously.quality inn and confort suite be just down the road from this hotel .<ssssss>i will be try one of they or another one next time.sort of a 2.5 out of 5 overall , with a 1/5 for the second stay and a 3/5 for the first .<ssssss>

speed boat and snorkel , feed the fish ... great stuff .<ssssss>seona catamaran trip be stunning ; beach , dolphin , fly fish , and the catamaran itself .<ssssss>the trip be excellent but be wary of the price we have a family of four and to take the three trip we go on cost a additional Â£650 .<ssssss>8 .<ssssss>money ; take $ dollar and rd $ dollar .<ssssss>when you step of the plane it will cost you $ 40 to get in , and it will cost you $ 20 each to get back out .<ssssss>make sure you have this money to hand .<ssssss>when you go through custom and you be in the departure lounge they be no cash machine , so make sure you have enough money to last the two hour you have to wait for you plane .9 .<ssssss>smoking ; we do not smoke .<ssssss>if like we you do not , then you will find this complex pretty uncomfortable at time .<ssssss>bar , restaurant , and reception area be all smoking area .<ssssss>so be aware .<ssssss>10 .<ssssss>conclusion ; the dr be a wonderful country , with amazing beach , with happy and friendly people .<ssssss>the staff at the complex work they sock off , and we have no complaint over the effort they put in to make we holiday a lovely experience .<ssssss>please remember the average wage for dr worker be Â£3-4 per day .<ssssss>we would go back but not to the bambu .<ssssss>save some more of you you money and go to the riu palace or the riu macao .<ssssss>riu bambu ... more like riu boohoo<ssssss>
2 2 5 5 3 5 5 3		beware of the flea !<ssssss>i stay at this hotel for a week and leave have a positive opinion for the hotel and its stuff .<ssssss>it be true everybody be friendly , eager to help with every small or big problem that appear always smile .<ssssss>but when my 13 month daughter start bear mark on she body , i could not believe that the diagnose would be : flea 's bite , from the mattre or the carpet .<ssssss>if you can not be sure for you child 's health in a 3 star hotel in one of the most popular city in europe today , where can you be ?<ssssss>there be no excuse for that , as item that be destine to be use by babe should be sterlized.shame on everybody responsible for that .<ssssss>

3 2 3 4 3 3 3 1		not worth the money this hotel look much nicer than it be .<ssssss>it be very expensive , and massive -lrb- too big -rrb- - and yet they charge for everything .<ssssss>if you have a car , you be force to either pay $ 15/day to self park or $ 20/day for valet parking .<ssssss>the only free wireless internet be in the lobby - it cost $ 15/day to have it in you room .<ssssss>the restaurant all cost about double what they should , and only the italian restaurant be really worthwhile .<ssssss>it be a beautiful property , however , and very close to the rainforest -lrb- dont do the hotel-organized tour , go yourself ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the pool be big and well-maintained , and the beach be nice but the ocean be pretty rough .<ssssss>overall , not worth the money to book directly through the hotel .6.5 / 10<ssssss>

1 1 1 4 1 3 2 2		never go back again my wife and i stay here from sept 17th through sept 19th and i have to say that i be extremely disappointed .<ssssss>from the tub -lrb- not a shower -rrb- that have a hose to clean yourself off to the creepy closet that seem out of saw the movie .<ssssss>i be eat up by bug at night and the breakfast be something comparable to a motel 6 .<ssssss>the staff be nice but the room be terrible .<ssssss>i have stay in pricely hotel -lrb- ritz and waldorf astoria , palace in ny -rrb- and in motel like the aforementioned motel 6 .<ssssss>i be sad to say that this stay be more comparable to that of a stay at the motel 6 .<ssssss>i find a couple of hair in the tub and we be only give 2 clean towel - no hand towel ... just 2 shower towel .<ssssss>as for the furniture , there be a badly stain chair place in the middle of the room .<ssssss>the bed be hard but i come to expect that in european or hotel bed sometimes so that be not a big deal to we .<ssssss>one last thing , the window be seal shut and the room seem dark and creepy .<ssssss>i have to say that we stay at torre guelfa severely damage my view of florence - i do not know if i would ever want to return to the city let alone the hotel .<ssssss>
3 4 4 4 3 2 1 4		ok but some annoying detail first of all , we have to consider the new design of novotel hotel much much better than in the past .<ssssss>it be simple , clear , modern and very good with flat screen tv , very comfy bathroom with elegant design and a good scheme of colors.about the size , it be small but reasonnable because we book a standard room and in comparaison with hk standard , it be ok , about 20 sq meter .<ssssss>however , even if the room be nice , the staff of the hotel be absolutely not helpful and not smily at all .<ssssss>even if you arrive with a lot of baggage , nobody will help you to bring it to you room .<ssssss>they do not say welcome and they do not care if they disturb you .<ssssss>in the morning , even if you place the sign do not disturb in front of you room , they will call you if you need they make the room .<ssssss>it be totally disturbing because we want to sleep and we have be wake up .<ssssss>nobody say sorry and it be not acceptable.we can complain about the soundproofing as well which be not good at all and you will have the impression to live with you room neighbour .<ssssss>depend of the kind of customer will saty close to you room , it could be ok but it could be much more noisy as well ... however , it be a good adress because the location be perfect , in the middle of wanchai and the design be very interesting.but the management should train better the staff because this be a four star hotel ...<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 4 3 2 -1		nice resort , so-so food , but beach excel we stay at the ambar during the week of 6/8 .<ssssss>we have great weather untl the end of the week .<ssssss>the beach be probably the nicest we have be to , have be to place like paradise island , cancun , riviera maya , jamaica .<ssssss>the topography be stunning .<ssssss>the resort itself be impeccably clean .<ssssss>room be nice but musty smell .<ssssss>the language barrier -lrb- we speak english -rrb- be troublesome at time .<ssssss>we have a few minor problem but the staff do eventually accommodate we .<ssssss>as for the food , it be mediocre at best .<ssssss>we enjoy the ambar gourmet restaurant -lrb- great lobster -rrb- and the bavaro italian restaurant .<ssssss>it be a huge problem to not get into the restaurant of you choice , and if you be lucky enough to do so , you be eat at 9:30 at night .<ssssss>the alcohol be another disappointment .<ssssss>for one , the mix they use for the frozen drink have a very weird aftertaste .<ssssss>and , the wine selection be horrible .<ssssss>basically you be drink boxed wine , unless you pay for a bottle ... the tram be a nice touch and come in very handy at time .<ssssss>the place be so large that you do a lot of walking.our one major problem be that we transportation -lrb- bp usa - sol tour -rrb- forget to pick we up on the morning of we departure .<ssssss>after complain to about 5 different employee -lrb- guest service finally help in the end -rrb- , they provide a van for we - but we be now 45 minute late leave for the airport .<ssssss>very stressful , especially in a different country.all in all , i would recommend this resort to anyone who be look for a nice relaxing vacation .<ssssss>you simply can not find a prettier beach .<ssssss>
2 1 4 -1 2 -1 1 -1		beautiful but staff need to rally !<ssssss>beautiful hotel with a view that take you breath away , and the comfort of the king size bed be superior ... however , the hotel staff really need to kick it up a notch .<ssssss>we never feel welcome during we stay , nor do we feel that those who work want to be there .<ssssss>the staff look unhappy and rather stress .<ssssss>after check in we need to change room when we find the bathroom sink drain break and hair in the tub , and soap from a previous guest be leave as a bonus .<ssssss>we be amaze to have to struggle with we luggage while hotel staff stand by , more thqn once .<ssssss>at one point we find ourselves help out other who be in need of assistance .<ssssss>be aware : overnight parking cost $ 30.00 .<ssssss>

2 4 2 -1 1 -1 2 -1		crap experience , unfortunately first of all , its we bad , we want cheap ... we get it !<ssssss>this hotel look like at one time it be quite nice .<ssssss>and be try to give it a break due to katrina recovery , but we check in -lrb- to a very dark room -rrb- and immediately see roach in the bathroom , which we have to call down to have they come up and clean -lrb- and it look like somebody just urinate all over the toilet rim -rrb- but , the phone be break , so we couldnt !<ssssss>they be accomodate to most request but , still ... roach and unclean toilet ?<ssssss>after 5 day there , they still have not fix the phone.be prepare for noisy as hell if you stay here .<ssssss>thin wall and people up all night party in the pool -lrb- suppose to be close at 10pm -rrb- we know its the fq and people be there to party , but we couldnt sleep and the staff would do nothing about the noise .<ssssss>plus the balcony which we upgrade for could barely fit two people and a chair .<ssssss>on the third day , room service decide to come at 8:00 am and after have to yell to keep they from barge in , they never come back to clean so we have to beg for clean sheet and make up we own room later that night.the staff be not unfriendly but due to all the above , it be a negative experience .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 3 5 3		love the ocean sand we have be to punta cana many time in the past and this by far be the best resort we have stay at .<ssssss>the food be excellent , especially the steak at the italian and the rib at route 66 .<ssssss>the pool , room and restaurant be all very clean and neat .<ssssss>we have a room in building 10 face the pool and the ocean and it have a jacuzzi tub and a king size bed .<ssssss>we could see they clean the pool from we room every morning , so we know it be safe for swimming .<ssssss>mike be the best , we go there everynight after supper for we cappucino and dessert , it have a really nice atmosphere .<ssssss>my only complaint be the room could have have better lighting and the time share people at the main buffet , but that they job and they office be right adjacent to the buffet so thats why they be always bug you there .<ssssss>the staff everywhere be very friendly , the maid work hard and the help in the restaurant be fantastic , and the bartender be the best , if you give they a tip the first night they remember who you be and you would get great service for the rest of the week.the main buffet for breakfast be excellent , the buffet at the beach have the same food everyday but it had enough variety that you could still find something different everyday .<ssssss>we do not have the best weather but that we have no control over , we make the best of it .<ssssss>all in all we have a great week holiday and would recommend the ocean sand as a great place to go .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 2 2 -1		hgvc kalia : still ok , but not exactly luxurious in a earlier review of this property -lrb- 2006 -rrb- , i have give it high mark for what be essentially a urban resort on a beach .<ssssss>back then it seem well run with the occasional long wait , but it be always clean , courteous , and well maintain .<ssssss>we be hgvc owner and we we return every year at christmas week .<ssssss>it seem this year something have go wrong .<ssssss>even though there be way fewer guest than in previous year , the staff seem very sparse and overworked -lrb- with the exception of the hgvc sale personnel , who be on overdrive try to sell more unit -rrb- .<ssssss>yes , the new refurbish lagoon be now open and most of the construction seem to be do , but when it come down to it , the difference between a aggravating and pleasant experience often rest on the shoulder of competent and adequate staffing.to be specific , when we arrive to check in at kalia tower , there be no valet parker , no bell hop to help we with we 3 suitcase and 3 backback and baby gear , and a line of 8-9 car just sit in the driveway with a bunch short-tempered people try to get in and out .<ssssss>we have to circle around a couple time because there be simply no way to sit there double-parked and unload we car without block people in .<ssssss>when we checked-in we be tell there be no luggage rack either , so we have to drag all we stuff -lrb- with small child -rrb- ourselves .<ssssss>it be not that we mind the work , but it be a very different experience than in previous year when we only have to wait 5-10 minute until a bell-hop come by .<ssssss>we have to leave we car key with front-desk until someone could come by and park we car.the mandara spa facility , which usually be clean and well-run , also seem to be suffer .<ssssss>the shower drain be so clogged , i be ankle deep -lrb- wear spa sandal -rrb- after about a 6 minute shower .<ssssss>with other people 's hair float around my ankle !<ssssss>the wet-sauna be unusable -lrb- broken -rrb- and some of the post-shower amenity -lrb- hairspray , brush , etc. be either miss or unreplenished .<ssssss>but the masseuse and facialist both be as excellent as before.our room have a terrible stink of mildew come from the bathroom and the hardwood floor have a gritty , dirty residue -lrb- the bottom of we bare foot would turn dark grey after walk around the room -rrb- .<ssssss>i have like that these room be usually perfectly clean , so this be disappointing .<ssssss>in past year when encounter worker at lagoon and kalia hgvc building or on the grounds , they would usually greet we and let we pass .<ssssss>this year they pretend they do not see we or other guest and amble along at they tired pace drag they cart or equipment , ignore the crowd of people build up behind they .<ssssss>i do not blame they if they do more then they usual share and be tired , but i have to say that this be not the ` luxury ' or even solidly competent resort service i have grow accustomed to at this property.it be still a great location , but if you come in the next couple of month , do not have very high hope .<ssssss>for whatever reason , this be not the place it use to be.addendum : my brother be a owner in the grand waikikian and he be sorely disappoint by how slip-shod the quality control be .<ssssss>the washer-dryer malfunction , the dishwasher need to be repair .<ssssss>he and he wife have to spend hour of they vacation get people to come fix these thing again and again -lrb- they do not fix it the first or second time -rrb- .<ssssss>
2 1 1 3 3 2 2 -1		give it and the attach sukman travel a miss ... the hotel itself be old and in need of refurbishment .<ssssss>its interior suggest day of glory but ... the facility be tire , with the ` gym ' consist of four cardio machine and the main bar better view in the dark .<ssssss>the pool do look good from a distance.the staff be average at best although when compare with the exceptional hospitality i experienced elsewhere in singapore , they be find to be sadly lack .<ssssss>consistent with that thought , my one room service order be incorrect.the onsite travel agency sukman be to be avoid .<ssssss>they endeavour to charge I $ 280 for a service i end up attend to for $ 70 and while i understand the need to make a profit , a 400 % markup present as somewhat excessive .<ssssss>moreover , they lie in tell I all flight to viet nam be book for the follow three day .<ssssss>i should be clear that i be uncertain sukman have anything to do with the golden landmark apart from have enter into a tenancy agreement .<ssssss>that say , avoid they .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 4 -1 3 -1		fine we stay here for 1 night prior to embark on a princess cruise .<ssssss>we room be very comfortable with a very comfortable bed and clean with a excellent shower in the bathroom .<ssssss>we dine in the restaurant -lrb- a la carte -rrb- and find the service to be a bit hit and miss .<ssssss>the food be very nice but pricey and i would not recommend this if you want a fine dining experience because we have finish we meal within 50 minute of sit down.the reception staff be very pleasant and helpful.breakfast be buffet style and there be a good choice.this be predominantly a conference hotel and not ideal for a family holiday .<ssssss>there be very little to do in the surround area as it be a commercial area and the hotel be situate very close to the airport - although you can not hear the plane from inside the hotel .<ssssss>
2 4 2 -1 1 -1 3 -1		a little dirty when we drive past the hotel , i be immediately worry , it look old !<ssssss>i be hope that they have spend the money inside .<ssssss>they have not .<ssssss>it be not grossly gross , but the blanket be stain as be the shower curtain , to the point where you do not want to touch it .<ssssss>we do not spend much time in we room , so it be bearable , and it be a great location .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 4 3 5 3		great location pro : - great location , near train station , in the middle of the city and all tourist site be easily accessible on foot - feel safe , as hotel be on major road lead to duomo - clean and modern room - very friendly staff - have english tv channel -lrb- bbc , cnn -rrb- con -lrb- minor -rrb- : - usually only one person be staff at the reception , so can be disorganize when busy - shower be weak in we room - elevator to the 3rd floor where hotel be located be quite smalloverall , this be a great smaller size hotel that provide great value for money .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 4 4 3 -1		good hotel away from tourist area , excellent value ideally located , modern clean hotel .<ssssss>air conditioned room with complementary bathroom product .<ssssss>the night receptionist be especially helpful .<ssssss>the hotel be easily reach by metro -lrb- hospital clinic station -rrb- .<ssssss>we ask for room away from the road as other reviewer have mention the road noise , this request be grant .<ssssss>the room be a odd shape but perfectly adequate .<ssssss>we have not book the hotel breakfast -lrb- â‚ ?<ssssss>0pp -rrb- and have plan to use the pan co across the road , instead we have a excellent breakfast in la fornet -lrb- less than â‚?pp -rrb- only two door down from the hotel .<ssssss>across the road be a garage for snack and water supplies and a excellent pizza restaurant -lrb- similar to pizza express -rrb- , very handy as we arrive on a late-ish flight .<ssssss>we buy a 3 day transport pass , available at all metro station , that give we unlimited use of the metro , bus and also the train back to the airport .<ssssss>we find this be easier than a t-10 as we do not have to worry about when the ticket would run out .<ssssss>i would recommend this hotel to couple who want to be able to get out of the tourist centre yet still be central to reach all the sight .<ssssss>excellent value .<ssssss>

2 3 4 -1 2 -1 2 -1		so so ... i just get back from a trip to hawaii where i stay at several hotel -lrb- holiday inn , the mandarin and the prince -rrb- .<ssssss>far and above the mandarin be the best and none of the other even come close .<ssssss>ofcourse the mandarin cost a whole hell of a lot more .<ssssss>the prince come in second .<ssssss>we have a 5 th floor room .<ssssss>it be fairly roomy , nice big bathroom and separate shower and toilet .<ssssss>however , the 5th floor room be on the same floor as the swimming pool level , so you balcony be on the same level -lrb- there be risk that someone from the swimming pool could climb into you apartment -rrb- .<ssssss>also , we apartment have tiny little bug !<ssssss>i have to swat they off my computer screen , you could see some crawl on the bathroom floor , etc.the front desk staff be hopelessly lose , rather slow in respond to question , check-in be painfully slow , and they werent as friendly as some of the other hotels.internet access be 11bucks a day -lrb- no wireless access -rrb- .<ssssss>fyi-its free at the holiday inn and cost a bit more at the mandarin.in summary , if you want a room here , make sure its not on the 5th floor .<ssssss>the room be large , the bed be comfy and its walk distance to the huge shopping mall .<ssssss>a bit of a walk to waikiki beach .<ssssss>have a adequate swimming pool .<ssssss>staff -lrb- with the exception of the bell hop -rrb- be slow and inefficient .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 2 4 3 -1		different room for different booking ?<ssssss>we book we stay through hotwire and get a great deal at about $ 130 a night .<ssssss>i have to agree with the previous poster though , in that i think that the westin provide different quality room for people who book through online discount service .<ssssss>when we first check in , the lady even acknowledge that we have book through hotwire .<ssssss>but for what we pay , the hotel be great !<ssssss>clean room , albeit some stain on the carpet , a nice pool , and a great location .<ssssss>this hotel be great for all the central activity such as the market , space needle -lrb- hop on the monorail -rrb- and great dining .<ssssss>all that be say , if we would have pay the $ 300 a night that the room be go for and recieve the room we do , we probably would have be a bit upset .<ssssss>oh , and one other thing ... do not expect any above and beyond extra .<ssssss>the internet be 6 $ for 15 minute on they computer -lrb- free airline board pass print-out though -rrb- , refrigerator stock with pricey !!!<ssssss>item such that you can not put anything else in there , and stain on some of the linen and mattress .<ssssss>again , it seem it be a case of you get what you pay for so we be not upset , but definitely will never pay full price if all the room be like that !<ssssss>

2 3 4 5 4 1 3 -1		beware this hotel during vacation time there be a 30 min line to to check in .<ssssss>on a sell out new year eve they have two check in position open and the other 7 be vacant .<ssssss>tell room not ready , come back two hour later .<ssssss>nobody except front desk could tell we if the room be ready , so another 20 min wait in line .<ssssss>tell still not ready -lrb- 2:30 pm -rrb- .<ssssss>ask about how i would know when the room be ready .<ssssss>front desk tell I i would have to wait in line to find out .<ssssss>room ready at 3:00 pm when we arrive it smell badly of smoke .<ssssss>get ready for this , only way to change the room be wait in the 20 min line .<ssssss>what a joke .<ssssss>we book a executive club room and the 8th floor lounge be like macdonald playroom .<ssssss>someone should tell these people that the evening snack be not a dinner buffet for they kid .<ssssss>the lounge be pack with kid run around and the staff just smile .<ssssss>and ignore they .<ssssss>the same at breakfast .<ssssss>the room be very nice though and the hotel be in a good location .<ssssss>at $ 650.00 per night i think we could have a nice relaxing weekend .<ssssss>nw toronto<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 4 3 3		disgust the room be disgust , dirty , and infested with mosquito .<ssssss>i stay at dream for a week -lrb- have a fantastic experience there -rrb- , and on the day we be to leave , we flight be delay 9 hour , so sunw put we up at the bavaro princess for one night .<ssssss>the bavaro princess be nothing compare to dream .<ssssss>the room may be a little bigger , but the tub be rusting , the shower curtain have stain on it , there be a leak in the closet .<ssssss>we have no moquito at dream whatsoever , and the princess have they everywhere , they do not take care of they grounds very well .<ssssss>i do not get a chance to explore the grounds as we arrive at night .<ssssss>the buffet have no choice and the food be all cold.stay away from this hotel , book dream instead !!!!<ssssss>dream be amazing .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 2 4 3 -1		best choice , give the option i have great expectation for the royal hawaiian , as my parent and grandparent have always consider it the height of luxury on waikiki .<ssssss>i do not want to stay in a high rise , but want to stay somewhere with a bit of history .<ssssss>my expectation be only partially meet , however .<ssssss>the lobby and grounds be beautuful , and the location can not be beat .<ssssss>we wake up early every day and get lounge and umbrella on the beach and swam before the beach get too crowd .<ssssss>the royal hawaiian truly have the best stretch of beach on waikiki .<ssssss>we be also able to walk to the hilton and several other hotel , and duke 's and the hula grill , next door , be convenient for meal .<ssssss>we do not eat at the royal hawaiian , other than appetizer at the bar , because we feel it be extremely overpriced .<ssssss>the mai tai bar be great for sunset cocktail , though , and the live entertainment be wonderful .<ssssss>it be also a good place to sit and enjoy the entertainment from the luau on monday night if you do not want to pay for the full luau experience.on the downside , the interior of the hotel just seem a little ... tire .<ssssss>i have stay at much nicer and more well-kept luxury property .<ssssss>we garden view room in the historic wing be a disappointment .<ssssss>the carpet be old , it be dark , and the bathroom be tiny with dirty basin and horrible water pressure .<ssssss>i notice that the room across the hall be much nicer , so apparently this varies.the service , too , be nothing special .<ssssss>the valet be helpful with direction , but some obviously expect a tip for do little more than point we in the right direction .<ssssss>maid service be not what i would expect from a luxury property .<ssssss>we come back to the room for a quick shower just as the maid be enter , and she insist on make we wait while she -lrb- hurriedly -rrb- clean we bathroom and room , rather than come back later as we requested.overall , i would stay here again , give the option .<ssssss>we get a great rate , however ; i would not pay the advertised $ 300-450 rate to stay here .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 3 4 5 3		need a update my husband and i vacation at the intercontinental the week before memorial day weekend .<ssssss>let I preface this by say that the staff at the hotel could not be nicer .<ssssss>they be polite , helpful and friendly .<ssssss>the room , -lrb- we have a standard -rrb- could definitely use a overhaul .<ssssss>the size be generous , but the furnishings be tired look .<ssssss>the couch be saggy , and the bed have the same tired look bedspread that weigh a ton .<ssssss>i do not understand why a hotel in the tropics would not opt for lighter , more attractive bedding to enhance the appearance of the room.the bathroom , again generous in size , have poor lighting .<ssssss>th shower be almost dungeon like .<ssssss>there be no magnifying make-up mirror , so lady , if you need that to primp , you may want to bring you own .<ssssss>due to the poor lighting , i have to purchase a mirror and apply my make-up at the the desk .<ssssss>the pleasantness come to a streak halt as the friday of memorial day weekend be upon we .<ssssss>hello coney island !<ssssss>the guest that come at that point be loud , play radio on the beach , and leave they garbage strew all over the place .<ssssss>i feel sorry for the staff .<ssssss>at that point , i be happy to be leave the follow day .<ssssss>that same night , we neighbor be blast music at midnight and proceed to deny it to the security staff that i have to call .<ssssss>i would go back , during a quiet week .<ssssss>if you be look to relax without the ny/nj crowd , make sure you do not go during a busy time .<ssssss>-lrb- i be a new yorker by the way -rrb- you may definitely want to try some of the local restaurnat as the hotel food be quite expensive .<ssssss>the nightlife at the el san juan be a lot more lively on friday and saturday night , so we find ourselves walk there in the evening .<ssssss>
5 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		excellent location and service i stay in a single large room with my wife and son .<ssssss>the hotel be extremely well located and within walk distance of many site and restaurant .<ssssss>we room be on the second floor -lrb- 3rd floor american -rrb- and look into a internal courtyard .<ssssss>although the hotel be centrally located we have a very quiet room .<ssssss>no street noise at all .<ssssss>the staff be friendly , courteous and helpful .<ssssss>i recommend the hotel and would stay there again .<ssssss>it be somewhat expensive .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 3 5		great hotel in great location we book a group holiday of 8 lad xma time 07 , think the hotel be great get a really good deal compare to other hotel in amsterdam and while the receptionist be a bit snotty suppose it be to be expect for group of lad in a 5 star -lrb- even though its prob a 4 ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>find this hotel pretty standard of other nh hotel the room be spacious with large bathroom and the hotel overall be spotless .<ssssss>the best thing about this hotel be its location hop off the train or bus from central station and its opposite the road and at the back of the hotel be the start of the red light district with a straight walk down to dam square , everything be within walk distance of this hotel and i would really recommend this hotel to anyone staying in amsterdam .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 2 1 2 -1		tired although this hotel be close to the convention centre in darling harbour it be more like a back packer hotel .<ssssss>the entrance foyer be so outdated and the corridor be dark and dingy .<ssssss>the hotel room be also small for the price pay .<ssssss>my room have a very noisy bar fridge if you call it a bar fridge at all .<ssssss>there be 3 tiny long life milk container in it !!<ssssss>i get up during the night and turn it off so i could get some sleep .<ssssss>the hotel room smell of cigarette even though i have ask for a non-smoking room.don ' t even stay for breakfast - there be cheaper and better restaurant on the waterfront .<ssssss>i query the price of my room after hear on checkout someone get a cheaper rate .<ssssss>i definitely would not bother stay here ever again.this hotel need a huge revamp immediately .<ssssss>
4 5 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		a lovely resort - do not be scare away !!!!!!<ssssss>okay ... i be american , and my boyfriend be canadian , so you be get two different cultural opinion in this review ... .<ssssss>i do not usually read -lrb- or write -rrb- review , but i feel compel this time to put my two-cent in .<ssssss>i have travel extensively throughout the caribbean , but have never bother to read review as i believe that any place -lrb- or experience -rrb- be entirely skew by one 's own personal interpretation -lrb- hey , we be all different , right ??? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>so the reason i do read the review here be because i have to admit i be concern by what -lrb- seem to I -rrb- to be such a extremely low price for a all-inclusive resort .<ssssss>so , after read all the negative review , it be with some trepidation that my boyfriend and i first step foot onto the hotel carabella grounds .<ssssss>well -- we worry needlessly .<ssssss>the hotel be beautiful and we have a great time .<ssssss>again , every experience , food -lrb- geez , even a sunset -rrb- , will be view and judge differently accord to a person 's own taste and preference .<ssssss>so i be not say anyone be wrong here , but come on !!!!!<ssssss>i would definitely recommend this hotel , and i think some of the review here be unnecessarily harsh .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful ; the grounds be wonderful and so well-kept ; the help be friendly , gracious , and helpful -lrb- of course you will always run into one or two not so friendly people -- anywhere you go ! -rrb-<ssssss>; the food be fine -lrb- and we eat pretty much everything they offer with no ill-effect from the food ! -rrb-<ssssss>; the little village next to the resort be fun to go through ; the drink be plentiful -lrb- tip from my canuck boyfriend which i love : bring a large plastic beer mug from home so you do not have to keep go back for another tiny disposable cup of beer - the bartender be very happy to oblige you by fill you mug to the brim -rrb- ; the pool be clean and pretty ; what the heck more do you want ??<ssssss>okay , so the room leave a bit to be desire , it be entirely true and i agree with other on this point ... but we be not there to spend time in we room .<ssssss>i would gladly trade have a posh room that i do not spend time in but to sleep , for the loveliness of the resort -lrb- and certainly for the very low price ! -rrb-<ssssss>we be lucky , though , as we air conditioning do work perfectly -lrb- it actually get too cold for I -rrb- .<ssssss>yes , the show be boring and the two time we go , it be just the same dancing put to different music .<ssssss>but what else do they do when they be cater to so many different language ?<ssssss>you can not have a comedy show , or a variety show , when you will have to repeat everything in 10 different language !<ssssss>think about it !<ssssss>my boyfriend and i enjoy the experience of be a minority when it come to speak english .<ssssss>it be a neat experience for we .<ssssss>but again , we be there to spend time with each other and it do not bother we that we do not have a lot of in depth conversation with other .<ssssss>just enjoy the diversity !<ssssss>and relax !<ssssss>that be what you be there for , right ????<ssssss>
4 4 3 3 5 4 5 -1		good hotel for the money , location be decent stay here for 2 night .<ssssss>hotel be clean , in good condition , staff speak good english and be very helpful .<ssssss>room be average for europe in size , but the bed be very hard .<ssssss>queen bed be 2 twin push together -lrb- very common in europe -rrb- .<ssssss>if not for the bed , i would rate it higher .<ssssss>do not eat at the hotel , but there be plenty of place nearby to eat .<ssssss>location be pretty good -- near la familia -lrb- main church in barcelona -rrb- .<ssssss>to get to the main shopping area , its about a 10 minute walk .<ssssss>tram be nearby too , though .<ssssss>its not too close to the beach either , but that do not bother we .<ssssss>we be not there for the beach .<ssssss>if you want to walk to the beach , i would say it would take about 20-25 minute .<ssssss>cab ride be quick , though.hotel be on a intersection that be fairly busy during the day , but not at night .<ssssss>noise be not a issue .<ssssss>overall , i would stay here again if visit barcelona .<ssssss>it be a good value .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 2 3 3 -1		disappointed : andra only so-so every december , a group of friend and i all stay together at a hotel in downtown seattle .<ssssss>this year , we break away from the larger chain and book a great deal at hotel andra .<ssssss>i have to say , it do not live up to the fabulous review .<ssssss>the lobby , front desk staff , and lola restaurant be top-notch , but the room be more like a three star hotel .<ssssss>the bathroom have grungy tile and worn towel with spot on they -lrb- even if they be frette -rrb- .<ssssss>the main plush chair in the room be shallow , stiff-backed , and very uncomfortable .<ssssss>the decorative pillow on the bed look like they have be fish from someone 's basement .<ssssss>i like the bedding , but the bed be so soft that i have a backache in the morning .<ssssss>conclusion : we usually stay at the sheraton , where we lament the crowded lobby and slow service .<ssssss>however , i prefer they spotless -lrb- if impersonal -rrb- room to andra 's uncomfortably aged room .<ssssss>
5 5 3 3 5 5 5 -1		love the excellence !<ssssss>.<ssssss>at the beach<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 3 4 5 -1		a little shaky , but great service staff be very accomidating consider all the problem we have .<ssssss>we arrive and be not tell about some additional per person charge for the guest , the staff be nice enough to waive the fee .<ssssss>we check into we suite and go we for dinner to a little place one block away .<ssssss>we should have go to emeril 's , but we decide to go a local nearby spot , what a dissapointment .<ssssss>we return after take in some of the sight to major plumbing problem .<ssssss>the staff say they would move we room immediately -lrb- which didnt actually happen until 5 hour later -rrb- and when we be pack up we thing we find a mouse in we room .<ssssss>the hotel , obviously aware of we displeasure accomomidate we by move we to a larger suite , free parking , nd they give we a fruit basket and a bottle of wine , plus a discounted room rate .<ssssss>over all i be ultimately please with the service even if there be a slew of bad luck .<ssssss>the buffet and free happy hour be great for budget traveler , but when you be in new orlean you should enjoy all the food opportunity present .<ssssss>
3 1 2 5 3 3 4 -1		not worth the price hotel in poor repair .<ssssss>i have stay there just last year in a very nice room ; however , i be place in a marina room that be subpar.food be way overpriced and , in many case , pedestrian .<ssssss>the folk that work there be very nice .<ssssss>new owner have a long way to go to restore desirability .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 4 5 5 1		nice little getaway we stay at the tapatio cliff resort for one night after christmas as a getaway from the family and it be very worthwhile overall .<ssssss>we call ahead to ask for and receive a early check-in , which allow we additional time to make use of some of the resort ' facility .<ssssss>this be a very nice touch , since check-in be usually at 4 pm , which limit how much you can enjoy a place on a one-night stay.we think the room be quite spacious and clean overall , with warm , yet modern decorative finish .<ssssss>the bed be wonderful .<ssssss>there be only one vanity for the bathroom , which be located across a hallway from the water closet itself .<ssssss>the light switch for the water closet be on the outside wall , which be little awkward .<ssssss>the separate living room be fine , but the sofa be stiff and there be no coffee table to set a drink on .<ssssss>it would also have be helpful for the room to have a refrigerator separate from the mini-bar like some other resort have be know to provide .<ssssss>-lrb- we would hear mixed review about the different point of view restaurant and decide instead to stay in with food wine from the aj 's fine food store located north of the resort at 7th st. thunderbird , which be a excellent store and turn out to be a excellent choice !<ssssss>no fridge mean mean creative use of the sink and ice bucket for we wine , cheese and sushi .<ssssss>ce la vie ! -rrb-<ssssss>although it be in the 50s-low 60 the day we stay at tc , we decide that it be still worth a trip to the water park / pool .<ssssss>-lrb- when you come from the 10s 20s , 50s 60 be quite a warm-up ! -rrb-<ssssss>this area be pretty well remove from the vast majority of the guest room and almost need to be drive to because of the lack of walk along most of the interior drive .<ssssss>the pool facility be very nice and very welcome and the cascade bar be also good .<ssssss>there be a smaller pool / spa / workout room in the center of the main guest room area , though it look largely close while we be there.one area i would caution guest to be the point in tyme restaurant , which be located near the main pool area .<ssssss>we go for breakfast before check out and it be a disaster .<ssssss>the service be abysmal and the food neither worth the wait or the price -lrb- 45 minute and $ 13 for huevo ranchero ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>this be noteworthy because it be definitely not high season when we be there , so i can only imagine what a treat it be in peak times.overall , i would recommend a stay at tapatio cliff .<ssssss>my wife and i would definitely have stay another night if we schedule would have allow and hope to get back for another stay the next time we be in phoenix .<ssssss>i should note that the resort be in the final stage of a renovation project , which currently have the main lobby gut and move to temporary quarter elsewhere in the main building .<ssssss>some of the parking around the main building be tear up or use as staging , but it be not a big deal overall and i would not let it dissuade you from stay at the tc .<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 4 -1 2 -1		convenient location for shopping , but average hotel we arrive at the hotel and be give a tiny room on the first floor on the street side of the hotel .<ssssss>the man at the desk be aloof and seem uninterested in we experience .<ssssss>we be suppose to have twin bed but it be just a double bed , with two twin mattress push together make up with two set of sheet .<ssssss>there be no separation between the mattress .<ssssss>we be there for 9 night so i be dismayed .<ssssss>i tell he i be unhappy with the room and ask if there be a better room available .<ssssss>he seem quietly irritated and dismissive .<ssssss>in contrast to the rest of the staff who be friendly and helpful , this guy really be a cold fish .<ssssss>he be professional , however , and offer we a larger room on a higher floor on the backside of the hotel .<ssssss>the bed be still the same , but the room be slightly larger and nicer .<ssssss>the breakfast in the morning be simple .<ssssss>a lovely sweet man -lrb- he be from another country -rrb- serve the breakfast : fresh juice , yogurt , and a basket of bread .<ssssss>you could order egg and bacon for a modest extra charge .<ssssss>the quality of the bread be just okay , not outstanding consider that we be in paris .<ssssss>they bring the breakfast to the room for free if you do not want to eat in the basement room .<ssssss>that be a very helpful service .<ssssss>they also provide the international herald tribune for free , a nice touch.the maid service be excellent .<ssssss>the tv be essentially a waste of time ; it be tiny and there seem to be a limit on the volume so we could not hear it .<ssssss>the bathroom be small but well design and equip .<ssssss>the real advantage of this hotel be the location in the 8th .<ssssss>it be just across the street from a monoprix -lrb- a small k-mart type store -rrb- , within easy walk distance of galery lafayette and printemp .<ssssss>it be near the st. augustin metro stop which be a pretty handy line .<ssssss>you can walk to the madeleine , a great gourmet food area .<ssssss>this be a commercial , business neighborhood , so there be none of the cozy left-bank ambiance we associate with traditional paris .<ssssss>so it be a mixed bag .<ssssss>this be not a exciting or inspiring hotel .<ssssss>it be a reasonably comfortable place to sleep while you be in paris , but it bring very little of its own to the paris experience .<ssssss>i find the rave review on this site puzzling .<ssssss>this be a average , at most slightly above average , hotel .<ssssss>next time , i will go someplace more inspiring .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 5 5 2		excellent location and staff i have just return from a 3 day city break in barcelona.you could not be base in a more central location than hotel pulitzer , the hotel be very clean and the staff be extremely helpful and friendly .<ssssss>the room be smallish but be adequate .<ssssss>the bathroom be large in comparison to the hotel room.breakfast be a optional extra which should be pass on as there be numerous cafe in the area that be much cheaper .<ssssss>all in all the hotel be a excellent base for a short stay in barcelona.and i have to emphasise that the staff be excellent and extremely helpful , in particular one girl that work the evening shift in reception .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 4 3 5 -1		have a great time but not a 4.5 star resort .<ssssss>the beach<ssssss>

4 3 5 4 5 3 3 -1		good central location stay here for 3 night .<ssssss>after i book i be a bit concerned as all i keep read about in the review be that it be really noisy .<ssssss>when we check in we be on the 1st floor and as the hotel be full could not change .<ssssss>i have get to say that the outside noise really be not bad at all .<ssssss>if you choose a central location in a busy city you have to expect some traffic noise but as the bedroom be towards the back of the suite it really be not a problem .<ssssss>however , we must have be near where all the housekeeping staff meet up in the morning and the noise they make be bad .<ssssss>the suite door bang really loudly - you just can not close they quietly .<ssssss>the door start bang about 6am and really disturbed you .<ssssss>apart from this the suite be great .<ssssss>it be clean and modern with a lovely kitchen area and dishwasher .<ssssss>the bathroom be a bit on the small side .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		great location this hotel be in a great location right off of i-10 , but the best part be its proximity to south mountain - only a few minute drive from the hotel to the parking area at the mountain , or you could walk it if you do not mind the busy street .<ssssss>if you plan to do any hiking , this be a perfect place to stay .<ssssss>there be also lot of restaurant to choose from nearby and right across i-10 in tempe .<ssssss>the room be large but need renovation , although they be clean and it be well worth the $ 72 we pay - especially consider that it be march in phoenix , usually a really expensive time .<ssssss>the maid be efficient and unobtrusive , the restaurant staff be courteous and attentive .<ssssss>definitely the place to stay if you be not look for a resort-type hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 2 1 4 3 2 1		overprice !<ssssss>i stay a week and regret it .<ssssss>on the website it seem modern , but when i get there i be seriously disappointed .<ssssss>it be try to be something it obviously be not .<ssssss>it say it be pet friendly , however , when i get there with my two dog i have no place to walk they .<ssssss>they didnt even provide a patch of grass .<ssssss>so why the pet fee ?<ssssss>if you want to go to walk you dog you better be prepare to either walk or drive 2 mile to green lake park , which can be hassle to do in the morning before go to work .<ssssss>the toilet be back up and despite call the front desk the afternoon it happen they send someone the next morning .<ssssss>the shower curtain be so short that the floor get easily wet .<ssssss>the wireless be non responsive ... most of the time not even work .<ssssss>i call the internet service provider but even after do so it never work .<ssssss>i have to get a ethernet cable .<ssssss>they only offer about five channel and hbo so if you be there for a extended stay you may get a bit bored .<ssssss>the layout of the building be pretty bad too .<ssssss>you can not open the curtain to you room without everyone be able to see in there ... no privacy at all .<ssssss>so i have to stay there with the curtain draw which can get a bit sad .<ssssss>it be also locate on a very busy street and i hear siren mulitple time a day .<ssssss>on a positive note , the breakfast be good , front desk staff be very accomodate with fax i need send or receive and the housekeeping staff provide good service and friendly.i be expect something more for almost $ 200 dollar a night with a govt rate .<ssssss>for overnight stay it be ok , but anything longer or a person with pet can do better elsewhere .<ssssss>
2 3 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		very small room for even 2 people we recently come to sf for a long weekend and decide to stay here give the great location in union square -lrb- close to the bart , shopping , chinatown , restaurant , car rental -rrb- .<ssssss>i have to give credit for the location!as for the room , good thing we be just there in the evening -lrb- just to sleep -rrb- and we be out all day .<ssssss>the room be very very small .<ssssss>i would say about 12 x 12 .<ssssss>we be on the 3rd floor , not much noise surprisingly .<ssssss>right when you walk in the bathroom be on the right , fairly clean , but very old -lrb- industrial toilet , peel wall paper -rrb- and would only fit one person at a time .<ssssss>the closet be so small do not even fit we roll-on suitcase .<ssssss>the bed be 5 foot from the entrance and take up most of the space in the room , there be a desk , 2 nightstand , chair and a tv stand so basically very limited walk room .<ssssss>we have to strategically move around each other so that we do not bump into each other .<ssssss>so if you do not plan to hang out in you room , this be a good place to stay give the great location .<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 5 2 2 2		disappoint by sofitel pro : nice midtown location , new and sleek design , clean room and comfortable beds.cons : would not honor sofitel privilege card -lrb- despite pay $ 300 / night -rrb- because i book through priceline .<ssssss>be give a room with two oversize twin despite call ahead to tell they that this be a anniversary trip .<ssssss>we room # be the same number you call to get guest service if you forget to dial the 9 first , so we receive call all hour of the day and night from other guest .<ssssss>-lrb- do not stay in 1212 -rrb- and receive little apology for this.the shower door open the wrong way make it almost impossible , actually humorous , to get in and out .<ssssss>not worth the money .<ssssss>

5 5 3 4 3 5 5 4		great time i travel a lot .<ssssss>and everywhere - we , europe , asia ... and from my experience i can say - for the money you pay it be the best place in san juan to stay!i go to puerto rico to get some sun , to relax on the beach and to see the old city .<ssssss>and the location of the hotel be just perfect for that !<ssssss>also the room and linen be clean , the towel be absolutely new and snow-white , the territory have a very nice atmosphere - cozy and very welcome .<ssssss>there be laundry , internet , free wifus , 2 pool , restaurant , free coffee all day and microwave .<ssssss>and probably even more thing you can use , but of course have no time as there be so much to do on puerto rico !<ssssss>the staff of the hotel be extremely helpful and friendly .<ssssss>i just wish i could stay there more ...<ssssss>
3 1 4 5 3 4 3 3		not as much magic as there should be this be we 5th visit to disneyland pari with we 5 year old son but the first time at the disneyland hotel .<ssssss>we have walk past it on a number of occasion before and go in a few time to be totally bowl over with the beautiful entrance area and staircase .<ssssss>it be absolutely overpriced compare to the other hotel in the area but we be determine to go , save up and book .<ssssss>we stay for 3 night , 4 day in the park and travel with ryanair to beauvais and hire a car to get around .<ssssss>we stop off at a supermarket on we way over and stock up on water , snack and fruit - basically everything that cost a fortune in the park .<ssssss>arrival and reception at the hotel be very nice , bag whisk away and although we room be not ready we be give we park ticket and tell to come back at 3pm .<ssssss>we then head off for we day in the park and return around 6pm when we room be ready .<ssssss>we room be very nice , very spacious and clean and that be about it really .<ssssss>the minibar be price so high that we lock it so that none of we accidentally purchase anything .<ssssss>the bathroom be quite small and not what be expect although sufficient .<ssssss>as many other have say the tv in the room have no disney movie , cartoon etc in english which after a long day out would be lovely to come back to with a tired 5 year old and relax .<ssssss>the aim of disney though be to make sure you be not in you room but out -lrb- spending -rrb- in the park so it be possible that the aim be to make the room welcome but just not too much .<ssssss>breakfast be just ok -lrb- motorway service station standard -rrb- if a bit of a bun fight to get to anything .<ssssss>on one of the evening we order room service which again be ok but extortionate .<ssssss>i know the theme in this review be that everything seem to be very expensive but we already know this and be quite prepared to accept and enjoy especially as we book this hotel .<ssssss>the real problem that we have be that it be not any better than other hotel we have stay in visit disney and we be really expect better .<ssssss>it do not feel like a kid paradise and really do not deliver for we 5 year old .<ssssss>the location be great and the staff be very pleasant .<ssssss>we would however not fork out again to stay here although we would return to disney but would stay elsewhere .<ssssss>the disneyland pari hotel lack the magic we be look for and for we the old adage of y' ou get what you pay for ' just do not hold true .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 3 5 4 -1		stay near the square - in the middle of it all if you be contemplate a trip to see the golden gate and also seek basic accommodation with reasonable rate and a great union square location , then you need not search any further than the stratford on the square â€?though , not actually on the square , it be a half block from it .<ssssss>however , the stratford be in the middle of everything else : shop , starbuck and eaterie â€?oh , yes â€?the powell street cable car literally clang right past the front door.another bonus be its easy access to san franciscoâ€™s wonderful muni public transportation network -lrb- streetcar , underground trolley and bus -rrb- system as well as the area bart system , all of it operate from the powell/market street station .<ssssss>the hotel be situate on the eastern side of powell street and a two-block uphill walk from the aforementioned station .<ssssss>there be a large sign with vertical lettering of the hotel name above the front entrance .<ssssss>the narrow lobby be non-descript ; it consist of a small counter opposite a comfortable-looking sofa .<ssssss>on you leave as you stand at the counter be the cramped and slooooow elevator â€?i find myself use the adjacent staircase more often than not .<ssssss>in the rear , behind the elevator be a lounge area with television and the requisite computer -lrb- for those weak soul unable to breathe without 24/7 internet access . -rrb-<ssssss>the tea room , where guest have they fill of a light complementary breakfast -lrb- bread , muffin , cereal , coffee and juice -rrb- can be find on the second floor .<ssssss>actually , i though it to be a pleasant well-lit room .<ssssss>as you drink you coffee feel free to look down onto busy powell street and watch the cable car shuttle tourist up the steep incline towards the oh-so tacky fishermanâ€™s wharf .<ssssss>if you be the type who need a hearty breakfast to get you go , i donâ€™t recommend it .<ssssss>-lrb- instead , cross the street and head west a few block down geary to the wonderful olympic flame diner , where hungry patron can choose among 75 type of omelet . -rrb-<ssssss>the room , or at least mine , be all i need for a week .<ssssss>the bathroom with toilet and closet-sized shower be separate by a slide door ; the sink be actually in the room opposite the bed .<ssssss>i wonâ€™t call it small ; how about , i just call it comfortable ?<ssssss>in any case , who go to san francisco to sit in a hotel room ?<ssssss>not i.if you seek glitz , marble , valet parking and a nightly mint , then seek elsewhere ; otherwise , the stratford near the square be a enjoyable and wholeheartedly recommend place to rest you head .<ssssss>

2 3 3 5 2 4 2 -1		a terrible disappointment let I just start by say that this be we first trip to san francisco .<ssssss>my husband and i decide to ditch the east coast when it come to we vacation this summer and go to sunny california .<ssssss>i have some expectation of this hotel , but not to many give the fact that i have speak twice to they concierge , ken prior to we arrival and both time he be dismissive and rude .<ssssss>i be try to arrange some activity prior to we arrival and he tell I that i do n`t need to book anything in advance -lrb- never mind the fact that i do n`t want to spend my vacation plan my daily activity , hence i be try to do it in advance -rrb- and when i ask about different tour company that organize day trip outside of san francisco , he describe one of they and let I know that it be for outdoorsy people -lrb- you think ? -rrb-<ssssss>and he didnt care much for be in the car for 3 hour on the way to the american river .<ssssss>i actually think about move we reservation to another hotel , but it be too late.the hotel itself be very old , but it do have a lot of charm .<ssssss>the lobby have somewhat of a feeling of grandeur but the year of neglect can easily be notice .<ssssss>the check-in be pleasant , the front desk interaction be amongst the few pleasurable one we have while we be there .<ssssss>the room be very small and very contrasting in what the decor and upgrade be concern -lrb- the front desk upgrade we at check-in because we room be not ready - i do n`t want to see the room we be initially in if this be a upgrade -rrb- .<ssssss>the room have new curtain , new headboard -lrb- with some very suspicious stain on it -rrb- , a large flat screen tv , 1 night stand , 1 desk and chair .<ssssss>the bathroom seem remodel -lrb- new vanity and commode -rrb- until you pull back the shower curtain and you see the old stain , chip bathtub .<ssssss>overall cleanliness - ok anyway , the room be less important because we spend most of the time sightseeing.the concierge staff at the hotel be still rude and dismissive during we stay so we try to stay clear of they and on we departure day we call 4 time to arrange for transportation to the airport , leave a voicemail and never hear back from they .<ssssss>every time we would call the hotel operator to let they know that we be try to get a hold of the concierge and they keep transfer we to the same extension that we have already call and that nobody answer .<ssssss>we finally go downstairs and we be inform by a patronize ken -lrb- same one as above -rrb- that arrange airport transportation require for we to be physically present at he desk -lrb- which no one have mention during we repeat transfer call -rrb- and that he be extremely busy right as he walk in so he have not yet be able to return we call -lrb- although when we arrive at he desk he be not even there and we have to ask the fd to get he from the back area -rrb- .<ssssss>the conclusion ... .<ssssss>i have n`t stay at any other hotel in san francisco but i the next time i ` m in sf i will gladly try another one .<ssssss>sir franci drake be not bad , and certainly the physical imperfection could have be overlook if the staff be spectacular .<ssssss>but ...<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 3 -1 5 -1		location , location , location never have stay in new orlean i can not compare dauphine to any other hotel , but i have travel extensively throughout the u.s. , mexico , europe and can compare to hotel in other area .<ssssss>i would have to say that the location of the dauphine can not be beat , close enough to walk to just about everywhere .<ssssss>the people throughout every area of the hotel could not have be nicer , friendly , helpful and all around nice .<ssssss>the bar be delightful , great bartender , that make some of the best drink we have throughout new orlean , the bar be dark but pleasant , the breakfast in the morning be great , fruit , cereal , muffin , sweet roll , waffle you cook to order , juice and coffee , they have tea and coffee in the mid afternoon if you be around .<ssssss>now the room , unfortunately , the room leave something to be desire .<ssssss>there be 7 of we and we all request room with a view , but i guess not soon enough , we be in the main hotel , and i understand the patio room be much better .<ssssss>though we room be clean and maintained each day they alway appear dingy .<ssssss>the lighting be terrible , though 3 lamp , very dark , the room very small and the bathroom , though redone , be do poorly .<ssssss>however , in defense , the shower be fine and the pillow on the bed be great .<ssssss>all in all other than the size , dinginess of the room everything be great .<ssssss>the room definitely need a update .<ssssss>i would have to say it be a bit overpriced with my comparison , but then we be in the french quarter .<ssssss>we have three room not all near each other like request and the bill for 4 night come to around $ 3,300 .<ssssss>the amenity , location and people make the hotel .<ssssss>i would rate it about a 3?1/2 .<ssssss>i would definitely upgrade the rating if they update the room .<ssssss>some of the review just before we leave be a bit scary but none of what we have read be true .<ssssss>
3 2 5 5 5 1 4 -1		disappointed this be we fourth stay at this hotel and it may have be we last .<ssssss>while we have always be very pleased with the lovely , serene atmosphere of the place and the convenience of its setting , right above the bugis mrt stop , we have never be very impress by the quality of check-in .<ssssss>this time check-in be so unprofessionally rude and slow for a five star hotel that i write a note to the management .<ssssss>after a 24 hour journey we be keep half a hour at the desk -lrb- there be no other people check in -rrb- while the receptionist occasionally glare at we and tap furiously on the computer .<ssssss>no explanation , no apology .<ssssss>five month earlier we have request a rollaway for we four year old son on the hotel website , and send a additional email -lrb- to which we never receive a reply -rrb- .<ssssss>the rollaway be not in the room , and despite the reluctant acknowledgement of the receptionist that we have request one it be not there two hour later either .<ssssss>we have to make a special phonecall to make it clear that we young child need to go to bed .<ssssss>it be a real pity that reception be so abysmal because the other staff bend over backwards to please and the overall facility be great .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 1 1 1 3		eh !!!!<ssssss>this be a very budget hotel but pretty lobby .<ssssss>no baggage help .<ssssss>front desk be extremely incompitent and try to fill out the room on the far side first so make certain to request a room near the lobby .<ssssss>all room be same sizz no matter where you be -lrb- or king vs. two queen -rrb- .<ssssss>bathroom be large but amenity be lack .<ssssss>the floor be filthy and you foot turn black with soot on carpet -lrb- need renovation -rrb- .<ssssss>if you like walk barefoot in you room , do not stay here -lrb- get flip flop if you must -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all , it be not bad and it be easy to find off the 101 freeway and s. airport blvd. if you get a deal that you can not turn down , i suppose stay here ... if not , avoid this place like the plaque .<ssssss>we go to eat at houlihan 's at the holiday inn next door and it be like walk into a ritz carlton compare to this semi-dump .<ssssss>
4 5 2 3 4 4 5 2		try the mamajuana !<ssssss>its fantastic !<ssssss>my girlfriend and i just return from the warmth of punta cana , we stay at the lti resort and beach club in punta cana .<ssssss>i will get right to the point , the room be definately nothing to write home about , there be part of the ceiling miss , crack in the tile shower , the tv rarely work and it you attempt to fix it you receive a shock .<ssssss>somehow a lizzard become a roommate of ours , it didnt cause problem but ive never have one in my room before .<ssssss>another thing i find odd be that they come to fumigate you room during you stay at least once , although you may be tempt to tell they to wait , i be surprise at the dead bug i find in the room before the maid have a chance to clean they up after fumigation .<ssssss>that part aside the resort itself be very nice , very lush with big beautiful tree , shrub etc. all throughout the ground , the pool be great , the beach be awesome , there be plenty of chair but if you want one under a hut get up early , they be the first to go .<ssssss>the food end be average , although we never do try the a-la-carte ' resturant which be include , the buffett offer something for everyone taste 3 time a day .<ssssss>drink be awesome , there be a wide variety and the beer be very good .<ssssss>one thing i would say be a draw back for sure would be the folk from the ceyna beach club , which share the main resort grounds with the ltus .<ssssss>they set up at the only entrance to the buffet dining area and be quite pushy to entice you to visit the resort .<ssssss>basically similar to timeshare thing at other resort but these guy harp you 3 time a day , every day .<ssssss>i have one guy literally chase after I one day because the night before i make the mistake of say maybe tomorrow .<ssssss>tell they no and keep walk , they should get the point after a couple days.if you be look for a place with other canadian presesnt there , this may not be the one for you .<ssssss>lot , and lot of german people , many other european .<ssssss>a little different when you be use to mexico.overall , the 4 star rating this hotel have would be accurate in my opinion .<ssssss>we have a wonderfull time and for the price we pay , we get more than we money worth .<ssssss>* try the mamajuana , its fantastic *<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 5 -1 2 -1		construction on monmouth noisy we think the covent garden hotel be a very ordinary hotel .<ssssss>it do not live up to we expectation and certainly do not live up to the hundred of unusually positive accolade we have read from other ` traveler ' and travel expert .<ssssss>the vast majority of review we read be overwhelmingly positive .<ssssss>we be suspicious of the overzealous review but curious and want to experience the hotel for ourselves .<ssssss>we be disappointed.we request information from the covent garden hotel via e-mail three time and never receive a reply .<ssssss>two of the e-mail 's be address to the hotel and one be address to firmdale .<ssssss>eventually we have to contact the hotel via phone to have we question answer .<ssssss>once we hotel room be book the communication improve and we e-mail 's be return promptly.when we arrive at the covent garden hotel we find monmouth street under construction .<ssssss>the road be fill with sand , brick , machinery , gravel and construction equipment .<ssssss>a construction back hoe be park 10 foot from the hotel entrance and brasserie max restaurant .<ssssss>the construction begin several month ago and the estimate completion date be november 2005 .<ssssss>construction be very loud and begin very early in the morning and continue until late in the afternoon .<ssssss>we be very fortunate to have a room on the opposite side of the hotel and do not hear the construction while sleep .<ssssss>we talk to many sad and disappointed guest who be not so fortunate and be wake every morning by the sound of either jack hammer break concrete , machinery cut stone , or machinery tap the stone in place .<ssssss>monmouth street be very narrow and the noise be amplify along the street .<ssssss>we be very press for time in london and eat many meal at the brasserie max restaurant .<ssssss>during several meal we find the noise so loud we could not carry on a conversation .<ssssss>i feel very sorry for the hotel and its patron for this very unfortunate situation of which the hotel obviously have no control .<ssssss>catch any transportation at this hotel be a awkward experience at best .<ssssss>the construction outside the hotel involve reduce two way traffic to a single lane and add a brick sidewalk and designate parking space .<ssssss>the parking lane will have portion that jut out from the sidewalk in order to force a single lane .<ssssss>when they be finish it will be very difficult for vehicle to use monmouth as there will be no where for traffic to pass .<ssssss>if a car be park outside the hotel unload or wait for a passenger other car will be block and have to wait for the car to move .<ssssss>this will detract cab from pass by the hotel look for fare .<ssssss>on several occasion we see vehicle park outside wait for passenger and completely block the street .<ssssss>there be very few black cab that pass this hotel and the hotel doorman will either walk to the end of the street or jump in a car they keep a block away and search for a cab .<ssssss>many time there be no doorman in sight .<ssssss>do not be surprise if you arrive at the hotel and the doorman be block away try to catch a cab.we find the concierge service similar to concierge service we have experience at most london hotel .<ssssss>the theater ticket they purchase for we be very good but not fantastic .<ssssss>the concierge also help switch a reservation at popular restaurant to a different evening to accommodate we schedule but be unable to secure we preferred eating time.the hotel be well situate to many theater and you may not require a cab often .<ssssss>at night it be hard finding we way back to the covent garden hotel as the area be poorly light .<ssssss>many business near the covent garden hotel be either office or storefront and have they light turn off at night .<ssssss>with few landmark in the area we become lose on more than one occasion .<ssssss>at the end of monmouth there be a round about where seven street converge and all the street look similar especially at night .<ssssss>the hotel have place a huge british flag outside the hotel to provide some sense of direction to guests.we pay 255 pound plus vat for we superior room which include breakfast .<ssssss>have read a article write about the hotel that state the hotel policy be to automatically upgrade every single room to the next category when available .<ssssss>we get the impression that the hotel be not very busy and we be disappointed no upgrade be offer .<ssssss>we stay during peak season and the hotel do not appear very busy .<ssssss>reservation at the brassiere be never necessary and a good selection of table be always available breakfast , lunch and dinner .<ssssss>we superior room be well furnished and have a beautiful bathroom .<ssssss>the room seem very small to we even by london standard and perhaps have too much furniture in it .<ssssss>the room be so small it be difficult to unpack a suitcase .<ssssss>the cleaning staff do a excellent job and the room be spotlessly clean .<ssssss>the bathroom be well keep and look like new .<ssssss>the bar fridge be well stock but over price compare to similar uk hotel of similar category.the common hotel draw room be very nicely appoint .<ssssss>several day there be a sign on the elevator advise guest that the room be close for a private function during certain hour .<ssssss>consider this be the only drawing room in the entire hotel i think it be extremely pretentious of the hotel to close this room for a private function .<ssssss>the drawing room have a self serve bar with a attach kitchenette stock with chip , mixer and alcohol .<ssssss>the honesty bar be a novel idea but do not seem very popular with guest .<ssssss>do not expect self serve price as a self serve drink cost 8 pound for the alcohol and 2 pound for the mix.we eat several meal at the brasserie max and find the food to be hit and miss .<ssssss>we package include english breakfast .<ssssss>the breakfast be always overcook .<ssssss>the english breakfast be absolutely terrible each morning .<ssssss>on we second day i return the breakfast to the kitchen .<ssssss>the egg be stale , overcooked and cover in bacon grease .<ssssss>the bacon be extremely dry and the potato cake be completely black on one side .<ssssss>to say this be unacceptable for this type of hotel would be a understatement .<ssssss>the continental breakfast include many uncooked item and be far superior to the english breakfast .<ssssss>my wife like the fresh fruit which i thought be very nicely arranged.on we last day we have a early flight to catch to scotland and find the kitchen staff most rude and uncooperative .<ssssss>the hotel have offer a take away cappuccino and a bag breakfast but have forget about this .<ssssss>we arrive in the front lobby at 6:50 am and request entry 10 minute early to the brasserie max and the request be refuse .<ssssss>the restaurant and staff be ready for service but make we wait 10 minute until exactly 7:00 be .<ssssss>the staff than tell I that there be not enough time to cook a english breakfast with haste and meet my schedule .<ssssss>i would strongly disagree have previously have my breakfast burnt and discarded.after leave the covent garden hotel we go to edinburgh and stay in a deluxe suite at the balmoral hotel .<ssssss>it be interesting to compare the best hotel in scotland to the best hotel in london .<ssssss>we like the balmoral much better .<ssssss>the balmoral have better service , better food , better hotel amenity and better lobby .<ssssss>we enjoy we stay at the balmor far more than we do we stay at the covent garden hotel.our overall impression of the hotel be ordinary .<ssssss>do not agree with many of the review we read .<ssssss>would never stay at the covent garden hotel again .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 5 3 5 4		good value spend 3 night here from 1 march 2008 .<ssssss>excellent location-very close to mtr you can buy a urban pass that allow you to travel on all mtr line for 1 day for 50 hk dollar -lrb- about Â£3 .35 -rrb- .<ssssss>you can reach the waterfront in 10-15 min .<ssssss>hotel attach to shop mall with lot of cafe restaurant so you can eat cheaply if you do not want to pay hotel price .<ssssss>we eat buffet breakfast in hotel-very wide choice of food , tasty good value .<ssssss>have 1 meal in the bar which be also good .<ssssss>room comfortable , staff helpful polite .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 5 -1 5 -1		big disappointment we want this to be a special celebration because it be we 25th anniversary .<ssssss>we come in on a red-eye on july 2nd , and be not give the room that we pay for in we package .<ssssss>we be first give a room with two twin although we request a king .<ssssss>secondly , we be move to a non-ocean view room -lrb- 231 -rrb- although we pay for it in the package we obtain through liberty travel in mamaroneck , new york .<ssssss>then on the 3rd we be switch to room 603 , which have a poorly function air conditioner and be tell by maintenance that it be a old air conditioner and nothing could be do about it .<ssssss>we expect better service from a resort with the rc 's reputation .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 3 4 4 2		love it !!!<ssssss>my husband and i be at the riu taino from december 30th 2006 - january 6th 2007 .<ssssss>we have a amazing time !<ssssss>i have read about the garden be so lovely but i have not imagine how great they really be .<ssssss>we get to celebrate new year 's there and so they have close all the a la carte restaurant and serve lobster among other great thing in the main buffet area .<ssssss>there be a countdown party and so it be very exciting .<ssssss>overall i think the food be great .<ssssss>we have acce to 2 other riu hotel so there be always so many option as to where we could eat every meal .<ssssss>the breakfast be repetitive but honestly there be not all that much you can make for breakfast .<ssssss>everything we want be there .<ssssss>the a la carte restaurant be not as good as other place we have be to but they be not bad .<ssssss>i think it be a little funny that the salad/soup and dessert selection be still do buffet-style .<ssssss>we have room 1223 and it be very lovely .<ssssss>i like have those little villa instead of a huge hotel for everyone .<ssssss>it make it more intimate and romantic.the beach be very nice and the only downfall be that the weather be not the best .<ssssss>it rain on and off on many day and it be pretty windy most of the time .<ssssss>we still make the best out of it and have a blast .<ssssss>the hotel staff be always so friendly and welcome .<ssssss>they even let we keep we room for a extra 3 hour because i be pregnant .<ssssss>we go on the santo domingo tour and think it be worth every penny .<ssssss>it be a little long .<ssssss>.<ssssss>leave at 6am and arrive at 9 p.m but it really give we a idea of the dominican culture .<ssssss>overall excellent ... i do not see how anyone could complain ... we have be to several other place include europe and frankly this be a great hotel !<ssssss>the animation team be excellent .<ssssss>i have never see such great quality animation aside from cruise ship .<ssssss>beware : do not eat at the wendy 's at punta cana airport .<ssssss>my husband and i be sick exactly 2 hour after eat there and we be still deal with the consequence almost a week later !!!!!<ssssss>not fun !<ssssss>
3 5 3 5 5 5 5 1		not bad at all !!!<ssssss>i wish there be a motel like this in every city .<ssssss>i be work in san fran for a week , at my own expense .<ssssss>i do not expect much , i get a little more .<ssssss>the room be small but clean , decor be up to date and the staff be really nice ... i will stay there again !<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 3 5 5 3		good for we weekend getaway we enjoy the hotel .<ssssss>we be local and come in for the weekend with the kid to go to the theatre , museum , and just chill .<ssssss>as the other review indicate , the hotel could use some renovation but we room be good and we sleep well .<ssssss>it rain all weekend so be close to the pru mall and have the indoor pool be key to the weekend success , we book a non smoking room and the previous guest smoke in it - not good for we family so the bellman , deskstaff , and frequent-traveler husband deal with the siutation immediately and move we all quickly to a better room on the same floor.they also do not have bedrail for kid , so if you be travel with kid be sure to prepare for safe sleep - we 3yo fall out of bed during the night and hit he head on the nightstand .<ssssss>again , staff be excellent in bring lot of extra pillow to pad the floor .<ssssss>they be also quite concerned about my child and hopefully will stock up on bedrail !<ssssss>i be buy one for we next trip!good back bay location - close to symphony hall , duck tour , shopping , newbury street , hospital , t station right at pru ,<ssssss>
4 2 2 2 4 4 4 3		very nice but need update we stay at uma for 3 night last week .<ssssss>we have pay for a terrace room but be upgrade to a garden room .<ssssss>overall the hotel be very nice however for the price we pay the value be not there .<ssssss>the room be a good size , especially since we be travel with we young daughter , but the room be tire and be in need of update .<ssssss>there be nothing on the wall other than white drywall so you really notice that the tiling be in need of repair , stain on the wall , the mosquito net have tear and the towel be often tattered .<ssssss>it look like the hotel be once absolutely wonderful but it have now past its glory day .<ssssss>it need some love and care ... or at a minimum something on the wall so you do not notice all the fault .<ssssss>if you stay in a garden room i recommend ask for # 16 as it have the biggest garden area .<ssssss>i do not see the villa so perhaps they be in better shape and have be more recently update .<ssssss>i would stay at uma again but not at the price we pay .<ssssss>i think a fair price for what you get would be around the we $ 100 mark .<ssssss>we pay almost the same price that we pay at the ritz carlton the week before .<ssssss>although lovely and charming , uma be nowhere near the same category.the food at uma be fabulous .<ssssss>breakfast be excellent as be dinner .<ssssss>i would also recommend go to glow at como shambalah -lrb- uma 's sister property -rrb- for one of the best dinner you will ever have .<ssssss>also indus restaurant be walk distance down the road which be one of the best restaurant we experience while there .<ssssss>naughty nuri 's -lrb- where all the local ` expat ' hang ... and drink waaaay too much -rrb- be also across the street and they serve easily what can be consider the best martini in all of balus if not indonesia .<ssssss>some people rave about the food there , but i be mainly impress by they martinis.the spa be excellent and the price be much more reasonable .<ssssss>definitely worth a visit .<ssssss>service be nice and friendly and everyone cheerfully help when you ask .<ssssss>really good service predict you need and next move so that you do not have to always ask .<ssssss>uma 's not quite at that level yet .<ssssss>or my expectation may have be influence by the ritz the week before where the service be outstanding .<ssssss>like i say , the price we pay be very similar so i guess i expect the same level of service.in my opinion the hotel be not walk distance to the town .<ssssss>we do walk it once but it be not something you will want to do frequently unless you be a avid walker , especially come back to the hotel where it be uphill the whole way .<ssssss>also the shuttle leave only once every 2 hour , so we be unable to rely on it as a mode of transport unless we want to base all we plan around when the shuttle leave and come back .<ssssss>taxi be a better way to go .<ssssss>the hotel taxi be about 2-3 time the price than if you walk out onto the road and hail one yourself .<ssssss>depend on how comfortable you be do that and how comfortable you be bargaining .<ssssss>overall i like uma and i would stay again , but i would not stay there for the price they have we pay ... unless of course they update the room and take they service to the next level .<ssssss>base on some of the other guest we meet while we be there , i suspect that there be a large discrepancy in the price different people be quote and be pay .<ssssss>we be the unlucky one i guess .<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 1 4 5 -1		balinese look ; western charm puri santrian be we first contact with balus .<ssssss>we stay here for 3 night .<ssssss>all in all it be a mixed experience .<ssssss>the garden , reception and staff friendliness be outstanding , while the food -lrb- breakfast lunch -rrb- and the room -lrb- we even have a rat staying in we room ... -rrb- be mediocre , simply too western to experience a true bali feeling .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 4 -1 3 3		huge room for nyc although this be a boutique hotel , it be a great location and the room be very large for nyc .<ssssss>the amenity and decor be really second to none and they be update unlike other similar hotel in nyc .<ssssss>the only possible downside be the staff be not the calibre you would expect at a $ 500 a night hotel , but overall , you cant go wrong .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 2 5 2 2		perfect for those new to hawaii i have stay at this hotel a total of 32 night in the last year .<ssssss>i will say on the plus side that this be a great hotel for those new to hawaii or those look for a great place to stay without have to see the rest of oahu .<ssssss>for those gold and diamond hilton member beware .<ssssss>you can not get a room upgrade unless you pay about $ 40 extra a night .<ssssss>and a upgrade be not really a upgrade .<ssssss>it just mean you may be on the right side of the building to see fire work .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i be on the side that have to hear the noise from the from pay celebration all night long .<ssssss>not only could not i be move without pay -lrb- as a diamond member -rrb- ; when i try to transfer to te embassy suite they threaten to fine I $ for leave early .<ssssss>this be not satisfactory .<ssssss>i think if you be come to hawaii for the first time this be a good place .<ssssss>if you be a frequent visitor for business try the embassy suite .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 3 4 4 2		reasonable !<ssssss>we -lrb- family of five , young child -rrb- stay at this hotel last year for a night .<ssssss>overall , it be not bad at all .<ssssss>i be actually surprise to see the rather poor comment about it on tripadvisor .<ssssss>yes , the hotel be old , the room be not very big , ... but what else be news in europe -lrb- italy , in particular -rrb- at a budget ?!<ssssss>we find the staff extremely helpful .<ssssss>the breakfast -lrb- include -rrb- be good .<ssssss>the elevator be small but hey !<ssssss>it worked!the location be great .<ssssss>biggest problem : no parking .<ssssss>in fact , as mention by another traveller , you have to unload you luggage , and then have the car park by the valet .<ssssss>however , i do not find the price of the parking and valet so terrible .<ssssss>i can not recall the exact amount but i remember it be reasonable .<ssssss>in fact , the compulsory valet be perhaps a blessing in disguise as i do not have to go search , etc. ... take a nice warm bath instead and enjoy it !!<ssssss>well , again , do not expect a dazzling six-star hotel , but i certainly disagree with most of the negative comment about this hotel .<ssssss>overall , it be ok i would say !<ssssss>

4 5 5 4 5 4 2 5		love the hotel , but sour receptionist i stay at the hoxton from 14 dec - 17 dec , and really enjoy my stay here .<ssssss>will definitely stay again if i can get a good deal .<ssssss>i do not manage to get one of the Â£1 night , but get one of the night for Â£29 , so the total cost for my stay be very cheap , consider the high standard of the hotel.the room be a really good size and i love the comfy bed and the gorgeous bathroom .<ssssss>if only all london hotel be this size !<ssssss>-lrb- i have stay in some really small one ... -rrb- the only reason for not give it 5 out of 5 , be the guy at reception who handle my check-out .<ssssss>he tell I that i have have a bottle of wine in the room , which i have not .<ssssss>when i point that out , he do not correct the mistake , but give I a long , hard stare instead , clearly try to get I to confess !<ssssss>i repeat , a bit more sternly , that i do not buy anything from the shop during my stay .<ssssss>then he get angry with I , accuse I of yell at he -lrb- what ??? -rrb-<ssssss>and tell I that he be only do he job , as unfortunately they have problem with guest order room-service and then conveniently forget about it afterwards .<ssssss>he be so stroppy with I that it ruin some of my good impression with the hotel .<ssssss>i see another review complain about a receptionist with bad attitude , must be the same one !<ssssss>all the other staff be lovely and they could not have be more helpful .<ssssss>i have write to the hotel and give they the name of the receptionist in question , hopefully they will send he on a customer service course : -rrb- but all in all : the hotel be lovely , the room be great and even though it be in east london , central tourist hotspot be not far away : -rrb-<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 5 3 -1 1		a welcome return to paradisus this be my second visit to paradisus punta cana -lrb- same time last year -rrb- and my companion 's first visit .<ssssss>i be not disappoint -- the vacation be wonderful .<ssssss>here be what i think you would like to know : punta cana airport -- be prepare to have you bag take to you taxi once you get they off the belt , and expect to tip .<ssssss>they basically will not take no for a answer about take you bag .<ssssss>however , they be efficient about get you to you taxi .<ssssss>the taxi ride , if you have not already pre-pay for a transfer , cost we $ 30 one way -lrb- same price no matter how many be in the cab , so you can save if there be more of you -- up to 5 people -rrb- .<ssssss>ride to resort -- bumpy road and a exciting ride -- road rule be not adhere to here !<ssssss>however , these people be use to drive like race car driver , so i guess you can expect that they know what they be do .<ssssss>we have to close we eye a few time .<ssssss>:--rrb- the ride to paradisus take about 30 minutes.the lobby -- beautifully appoint .<ssssss>check-in be easy -lrb- make sure you have something that show you reservation -- i have a printout from my e-mail -rrb- .<ssssss>we room be ready when we get there -lrb- around 2:30 , but we notice that some people have to wait a few hour , so pack a bathing suit and sunscreen to enjoy the pool/beach when you get there -rrb- .<ssssss>language -- the staff speak limited english .<ssssss>it be helpful to know a few word in spanish and i think it be a nice gesture to these welcome people to say hello , goodbye , thank you , etc in they language .<ssssss>treat they well -- i read that they only make $ 8.00 a day , and i know that they work 12 hour day , so be kind .<ssssss>a few american -lrb- especially east coaster -rrb- be very rude to they .<ssssss>they do not deserve that , and remember , you be not in america .<ssssss>be nice .<ssssss>plus , they go out of they way to be kind and they respond well to kindness .<ssssss>we be treat like royalty because we respect each and every one of them.room -- a bit musty -lrb- it rains/showers a lot and the humidity be high -rrb- .<ssssss>nice size -lrb- suite -rrb- , decent bathroom , nothing too fancy , though lot of marble .<ssssss>we have a standard garden-view suite .<ssssss>the soap/shampoo they provide be so-so .<ssssss>perhaps the water be hard , make nothing lather very much .<ssssss>you might want to bring you own.mosquitoes -- at the end of the trip , i look like i have the plague .<ssssss>the mosquito snuck bite in the evening and while in we room -lrb- you know that eerie sound when they fly by you ear ?<ssssss>i hear it most night -rrb- .<ssssss>bring mosquito repellant.pool / beach -- beautiful and clean .<ssssss>well-maintained pool , with a swim-up bar .<ssssss>beach be very clean and there be plenty of available lounge chair .<ssssss>boogie board be load of fun and the board be free to use.activities staff -- to I , these people be the heart and pulse of the resort .<ssssss>they be what make I want to return to this resort , and i be not disappoint .<ssssss>they remember I and welcome my boyfriend with open arm .<ssssss>they be very talented -- they teach latin dance lesson , they organize pool party , they dance and perform in the show each night -lrb- which , by the way , be top-notch for a island .<ssssss>we watch the show every night and dance with the dancers/activities staff after the show every night -rrb- .<ssssss>say hi from nathalie to jose , ambus , and ricky -- my favorites!activities -- make sure you check out the snorkeling and horseback ride .<ssssss>both be load of fun and include -- take advantage of what you pay for , because i do not think this be include in any other resort in punta cana .<ssssss>you may want to bring a towel to make the saddle a bit more comfortable , and expect to get dirty -- the horse be not clean and you will ride through some mud and ocean .<ssssss>my horse just love the ocean and could not get deep enough !<ssssss>i think it be funny and enjoy it ... go with the flow !<ssssss>i recommend wear long pants and long sock -- the stirrup will rub against you ankle and begin to chafe bare skin after awhile .<ssssss>note : you will trot , and perhaps gallop , some of the time , so if you be faint at heart , skip the horseback ride .<ssssss>one teenage girl in we party squeal with fear every time the horse begin to trot .<ssssss>sigh snorkeling : they take you from the beach in a very small boat -- you will go through wave , so you will have a adventurous ride .<ssssss>lot of fun !<ssssss>snorkele quality -lrb- number of fish , health of reef -rrb- be just so-so , but the boat driver bring bread , which we happily feed large school of fish with.food : abundant , though mediocre and sometimes downright bad .<ssssss>do not expect to please you palate .<ssssss>you will not .<ssssss>however , the restaurant that be good be el romantico -- you need to make reservation 2 day in advance .<ssssss>we have very good filet mignon there and the ambiance be lovely.overall -- this be a relaxing vacation , more than a adventure vacation .<ssssss>you basically stay in you resort the whole time , and there be enough to do , but you will not be zip here and there all the time .<ssssss>to really enjoy it , take dance lesson -lrb- offer twice a day -rrb- , go to the pool party and nightly show , and take advantage of the activity i describe above .<ssssss>or , just kick you shoe off and drink mamajuana all day -lrb- you must try that drink -- very good -rrb- !<ssssss>note : expect to be approach by people try to sell you timeshare , excursion offsite , etc -- this be especially a issue near the temple gastronomique near the beach , in the alley between the pool and the hibiscus restaurant .<ssssss>walk around that area if you do not want to be pounce on again and again .<ssssss>however , a polite no thank you or i have already do it -lrb- a little lie work -rrb- while you be walk away will get they to leave you alone -lrb- at least for the day -rrb- .<ssssss>do not be belligerent -- they be just do they job .<ssssss>
2 2 1 2 3 4 4 3		too noisy just get back from the casablanca and i be not impressed at all .<ssssss>the location be just 20 yard from time square -lrb- the oxford street of new york -rrb- .<ssssss>fine it you want to be in the thick of thing but can be -lrb- be -rrb- very busy.the staff be welcome , helpful and efficient .<ssssss>the room we have though be not up to scratch .<ssssss>it be one of the larger room with 2 x double bed , but it be located at the back of the hotel .<ssssss>therefore it be situate by the very noisy air conditioning fan from the other building around and about .<ssssss>it also suffer from no natural light at all .<ssssss>i would suspect that most of the room to the rear of the hotel also suffer the same problem .<ssssss>the only way we could get to sleep be to shut off we own air conditioning and close all the window .<ssssss>\ we have to rely on the ceiling fan to provide any cooling at all .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 4 5 2		a great place to stay in !<ssssss>this be the best hotel we stay in on we 3-week tour in china .<ssssss>a great place to stay in beijing , in a excellent location , just 5 minute walk from the main strip -lrb- wangfuje street -rrb- and 15 minute walk from the gate of the forbid city.at the front desk they give we a upgrade , so we spend 5 night in a spacious room , with a king-size bed and a huge bathroom , with both bath and shower.breakfast buffet be very rich , both western and chinese.the only fault be the high rate they charge for internet use in they business center - Â¥2 per minute , quite expensive .<ssssss>

2 2 3 5 2 3 3 -1		noisy my husband and i stay on the third floor in a room with a view of the cable car .<ssssss>i will start with the positive .<ssssss>this be a great location and it be really exciting to look out the window and see the cable car as well as be a few block from union square .<ssssss>the hotel room be decorate in a trendy way .<ssssss>the negative be the lack of air conditioning which be probebly not a problem most of the year , but it be when we go .<ssssss>the room be very small and the bathroom leave much to be desire .<ssssss>the bathroom have a toilet that have trouble flushing and someone els ' hair be on the shower wall when we arrive .<ssssss>perhaps some of these could be overlook except it be impossible to sleep .<ssssss>if you could fall asleep with the noisy cable car and traffic -lrb- we could -rrb- , you would not be asleep for long .<ssssss>trash removal happen every night , multiple time .<ssssss>it be terribly loud because there be so much concrete that make the sound echo .<ssssss>while the location be great and the room be trendy , do not stay here if you want any sleep .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 3 5 5 3		great location and service stay in one of the ` gold ' room - which mean you have you own floor with its own reception and also a dedicated lounge for all the people on the floor .<ssssss>first impression of the hotel be that the location be excellent - right in the heart of boston and a very nice look building from the outside .<ssssss>we walk into a massive lobby which do not appeal to I at all .<ssssss>it have a large busy railway station type vibe .<ssssss>luckily we have we own check in on the ` gold floor ' - this go very smoothly and we be take to we room -lrb- a double room for 2 people -rrb- .<ssssss>we be very surprise by how tiny the room be !<ssssss>so we ask if we could change room and this be gladly do by the very nice and efficient lady at reception .<ssssss>we be take to another room which be double the size !<ssssss>it have a few issue though .<ssssss>there be absolutely no storage space , the shower power be poor , and the tv be in a very odd position and very far away from the bed so we never even end up watch it at all .<ssssss>however we have a great stay and the service be excellent - include the reception and room serice .<ssssss>i would definetly return .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 2 5 4 5		convention central i plan a anniversary getaway that start off on the wrong foot and improve from there .<ssssss>as i usually do for we annual get-away i stop by the hotel early in the day of we check-in to drop off gift for my bride .<ssssss>i go to the concierge desk with three gift wrap box to be place in we room prior to check-in .<ssssss>the concierge sternly inform I that they do not handle such arrangement and that i need to talk to the bell desk .<ssssss>i wander over there to be greet -lrb- perhaps grunt would be a more apt description -rrb- by two man who clearly be not happy to be there .<ssssss>i place my gift on they counter and request that they be place in my room prior to we arrival as a surprise for my wife .<ssssss>they indifferently assure I that they would take care of it.well , you guess it .<ssssss>when we get to we room , the gift be not there .<ssssss>fortunately , a new bellman -lrb- omer -rrb- have come on duty and when i explain what have happen he promptly take I to the room where they securely store item to find the gift .<ssssss>of course they be sit there - the chocolate cover strawberry place upside down .<ssssss>i tell omer that we be leave for dinner at 6 and he could place the item in the room after we leave .<ssssss>omer come through big-time with not only my gift but multiple gift from the hotel in the form of apology.the seattle sheraton be one of the largest hotel in downtown seattle have recently add another tower full of room .<ssssss>it be also adjacent to the washington state convention center .<ssssss>lot of convention goer stay there .<ssssss>we weekend be no exception ; hundred of lawyer in town for a conference at the sheraton .<ssssss>it make enter and exit the hotel quite a lengthy and challenging process .<ssssss>parking be valet only at $ 33 per day.the sheraton do not have any fine dining but the daily grill be a fine diner .<ssssss>the pool and fitness center be quite nice , located on the top floor with lot of equipment and great views.overall the sheraton be a nice hotel but it be far from the nicest in seattle .<ssssss>
2 4 1 5 5 5 5 -1		interesting concept , but no thanks the botel look like a big boat anchor in amsterdam , and the interior be suppose to resemble cabin on a ship .<ssssss>while this may seem like a fun concept at first , the novelty soon wear off because the room be very small and the bathroom be incredibly small , so much so , that it be difficult to move around and not bump yourself into everything .<ssssss>all the room be smoke room , but ours do not smell , and you can open the window to air out the room .<ssssss>also , if you room be on the land side , you be face the train track lead into the station , and there be a constant squealing of the wheel on the track as the train turn into the station .<ssssss>however , if you can overlook this , what the hotel have go for it , be great location .<ssssss>it be a very short walk to the grand central station where all the train arrive and leave , and most of the bus and tram start and return , so get around amsterdam be extremely easy and convenient .<ssssss>also , as a guest in the hotel , a buffet breakfast be available each morning in a cheerful and clean dining room .<ssssss>the breakfast consist of assorted luncheon meat and cheese , cold cereal , assorted yogurt , toast and breakfast pastry , and hard boil egg , and coffee , tea , milk , etc. the hotel also have a bar/lounge area with a couple of computer that guest can use for a fee , but the area reek strongly of cigarette smoke .<ssssss>while the location be fantastic , and if you arrive in amsterdam by train , you can walk to the hotel , i would not stay here again , but would look for something with bigger room and bathroom in the area.one thing to be aware of be that a new subway station be be build right near the hotel and train station and consequently , there be tremendous noise with pile driver and jack hammer and lot of noise associate with a construction project , and all this activity start around 7 or 7:30 a.m. and continue to about 4 p.m. , so if you be a late sleeper , you may want to reconsider stay here until the project be complete .<ssssss>
1 1 3 5 3 2 4 1		what the hell !<ssssss>both my husband and i be hyatt platinum gold passport customer ... 1 -rrb- check in - we have request king room be give to small double -lrb- on honeymoon -rrb- - then move to a higher floor with two small double ... 3rd time lucky move to a king room.which be gloomy , the bathroom be awful the shower barely warm and drip water - no force.sound proofing terrible.rooms in need of modernisation and the tv be very 80 's .2 -rrb- expensive - how at these price internet access and pc be not free be ridiculous - any business service very expensive unreasonably so .3 -rrb- breakfast - buffet not worth it they serve concentrated juice and not fresh and only 3 hot item - two meat and egg so if you a veggie you only get continental.better value at the diner across the road .4 -rrb- location be great , view from 36th floor nice go for a drink in the bar around sunset .5 -rrb- stay in one of the very many other choice you can have in this area.i will not be come back - we stay 10 day and its only the staff that make it a pleasure .<ssssss>

2 3 2 5 4 1 3 -1		paper thin wall - not good if you value sleep just return from barcelona - cold but amazing place , building , shop and food excellent .<ssssss>we travel agent suggest hotel balme as we could not get availability in gravina .<ssssss>we look at review on trip advisor and they seem ok for go for it.this be 3 star and there be good and very bad point depend on you priorities.our first experience be not the best as we advance book a double non-smoking room .<ssssss>when we check they try to sell we a upgrade to a executive room for a extra e20 per night , but we do not feel it be necessary .<ssssss>when be take up to the room it be a twin and stank , i mean stank of smoke .<ssssss>they do not inform we of this when we check in , but tell I when i go to check - they tell I be fully book , no apology - even though they have already offer a alternative executive room !<ssssss>, which as this be they mistake seem poor and they attitude be totally indifferent .<ssssss>so we sleep in it and thank god be move the next day -lrb- or at least we though it would be better -rrb- .<ssssss>good point - breakfast great , time good and lot of choice and nice waitress .<ssssss>- location excellent for explore sight , metro , nice shop and restaurant .<ssssss>- hotel spotless .<ssssss>- free internet access if you can get on it as only 1 pc.bad point - the wall be paper thin â€?we could hear every cough and movement in all the surround room of which there seem to be many at every corner of the hotel .<ssssss>we have we fair share of noise some well into and in the middle of the early hour but i dread to think if you get someone who snore next door - then god help you !<ssssss>we think it be just a one off the 1st night in the smoke room but the noise problem be inherent in the hotel structure as there be clearly no cavity between the room .<ssssss>if you be a person who like sleep â€?you should avoid this hotel .<ssssss>- reception staff could not care less , they do not even say hello when we go in and out of the hotel , it be clear they be not happy in they work!having say apart from the fact we be quite tired as do not get great sleep barcelona be fantastic and hotel omm be a must for a relaxing drink after dinner .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 3 2 -1		no nomination , no oscar for this hotel i stay at oscar with a friend for 3 night in november .<ssssss>i have stay at the room mate laura and mario before , so decide to give oscar a go.i be disappointed ... i will definitely not be return .<ssssss>i be cancel a booking i have at the oscar for next summer .<ssssss>in fact , the experience have put I off the entire room mate chain.first the positive : -lrb- 1 -rrb- price be ok -lrb- 2 -rrb- somewhat funky design -lrb- 3 -rrb- free breakfast/wi-finow the negative : -lrb- 1 -rrb- no ac/ventilation in room -lrb- the staff say that it be switch on only in summer -rrb- .<ssssss>this make for a stuffy room that could only be ventilate by open a window - unfortunately the local area be noisy .<ssssss>so the choice be a ventilate room or peace quiet ... but not both .<ssssss>-lrb- 2 -rrb- a strange smell , emanate from the bathroom which get worse as we stay go on .<ssssss>when we complain , we be tell the hotel be full -lrb- sit night -rrb- so we could not be move .<ssssss>on sunday the smell be noticeably worse and we insist on be move .<ssssss>the staff oblige and we be move to another , smaller room -lrb- executive rather than the deluxe we have book -rrb- - effectively a downgrade .<ssssss>when we comment on this downgrade on check-out , the staff insist we have be give the same room type and offer no discount .<ssssss>we do not argue - we just want to leave asap !<ssssss>-lrb- 3 -rrb- incomplete room/hotel - upon arrival , the desk chair in we room be miss , there be no door on the wardrobe , etc. this hotel have a feeling that it be open in a hurry -lrb- which be surprising , give how it be mean to open in early 2007 and end up open month behind schedule -rrb- .<ssssss>-lrb- 4 -rrb- tv - strange observation : in we first room there be only spanish language tv channel available .<ssssss>in the room we move to , there be only non-spanish language channel .<ssssss>why not both ?<ssssss>ok , this be a minor point ... i do not visit madrid to watch tv.i want to like this hotel , but i come away disappoint .<ssssss>though the staff be mostly nice , they could have be more sympathetic when we need help .<ssssss>the hotel have a great location and potential .<ssssss>but it be be open too quickly and have too many rough edge .<ssssss>avoid !<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 3 -1 3 -1		i could hear the guy belch in the next room .<ssssss>stay there one night before fly out of sea-tac .<ssssss>i want to try the la quinta chain , and we pay the $ 97 rack rate for a double room .<ssssss>i be sorry we do not go with one of the many less expensive option in the area , and will not stay in a la quinta hotel again.i could hear conversation , sneeze and belch through the wall .<ssssss>the room be basic at best , and be miss some common-sense item such as a soap dish for the bathroom sink .<ssssss>the bed sheet and blanket be thin and worn .<ssssss>we do nothing more than sleep here and do not take advantage of the include breakfast , so i can not comment on anything other than the room .<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 4 3 4 1		overall a beautiful resort but with some pitfall ... just get back from a 7 night stay at the padma .<ssssss>overall we have a very pleasant stay .<ssssss>we pay extra for the club lounge benefit and be moderately satisfy with what be on offer .<ssssss>the coctail/drinks hour from 5-7pm with canape be great for the first few night but become a little dissapointing towards the end .<ssssss>the drink be slow to come out and the empty platter be not get replace .<ssssss>the option to have breakfast in with the main dining hall , in room or at the private restaurant -lrb- bella rossa -rrb- overlook the ocean be great .<ssssss>breakfast at bella rossa be just beautiful and a definite highlight of the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel pool -lrb- and deck chair -rrb- be not big enough to cater for all the guest .<ssssss>although i disliked do it , you must reserve you deck chair with you towel before breakfast if you want to get a seat .<ssssss>the room be average .<ssssss>we stay on the top floor -lrb- with balcony -rrb- .<ssssss>the real difference between the top ground floor be the bathroom .<ssssss>the bathroom on the ground floor be much nicer but we want a balcony .<ssssss>a upgrade to the bathroom on the top floor be in deperate need .<ssssss>the bath/shower be disgust with its dirty , smelly old shower curtain .<ssssss>apparently the standard room in the hotel arent nice at all .<ssssss>so overall if you stay at the padma its worth pay the extra for the garden club privledges.other positive include the excellent gym facility , friendly staff , beautiful grounds and great location .<ssssss>
1 2 2 4 3 1 3 3		definitely not the best resort out there !<ssssss>my 3 girl friend , and i stay at caribe club princess at the end of september and to say the least , we be quite disappointed .<ssssss>we be a well travel group and have be to the dr on a handful of occassion and have stay at many beautiful resort .<ssssss>we be a very easy go group in we mid-20s and love to have fun on vacation but i would say this resort rank the lowest in all the resort we have ever stay at .<ssssss>check-in : we have to wait almost 2 hour to check-in to we room .<ssssss>it be not even like we arrive in the morning but early in the evening and be expect we room to be ready .<ssssss>we make the most and have a couple of drink .<ssssss>we finally get we room but wait another 45 minute for we luggage to be deliver to we room .<ssssss>not to mention , the room be very hot and feel like there be no air circulation in there .<ssssss>definitely be not a good start to we vacation.restaurants / food : when you do not have to cook you own meal , i guess that be always a good thing .<ssssss>lot of variety but you pretty much have to make reservation first thing in the day for the a la carte restaurant or you would be out of luck .<ssssss>we end up eating in the buffet for the most part.beach / pool/grounds : nicer part of the punta cana beach but defintely not enough palapa .<ssssss>the pool be nice but they can use some touch up and need better cleaning from the debris that accumulate in them.entertainment : it be you typical animacion/entertainment team with various activity throughout the day and nightly show .<ssssss>overall , friendly staff as the dominican people always be and many of the reason we love this country .<ssssss>and we love all the cute dominican boy but we do encounter a couple of they that be to aggressive and way too flirtatious that it actually become annoying - and never have anyone ask we for money so bluntly .<ssssss>other than that , all the other staff be always friendly and smiling.overall , the resort attract more european and find ourselves , canadian , be minority amongst the tourist .<ssssss>not a bad resort but i would never go back .<ssssss>we get a good deal for we vacation package but i would have pay more to stay at another resort if i have know better .<ssssss>i guess you get what you pay for !<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		mixed feeling we arrive at the hotel to celebrate my partner 40th birthday.the lobby be very modern and i be impress with the lift in the middle .<ssssss>the check in be fast and we be show the room with harbour view .<ssssss>the room be very modern with stunning view but be not very large .<ssssss>the hotel do not do any arrangment for we celebration even a postcard.in the evening we go for a dinner at morton 's grill .<ssssss>here be the big disappointment .<ssssss>very high price for not so special meal and really poor service .<ssssss>the breakfast in the morning be ok but the food be cold .<ssssss>for my next visit i will consider shangri-la .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 4 4 5 -1		good location stay for two night on the fourth floor room large and clean fridge and tv and coffee maker , bathroom a bit tight but ok two thing against , noise from the street but they do give you earplug -lrb- only one set -rrb- and smell from extractor of the food court make the balcony unuseable .<ssssss>we second stay be at the end of we holiday for two night we be upgrade to higher floor and bigger room -lrb- no charge -rrb- which have a better view which allow we to see sunset while have a drink .<ssssss>noise much less of a problem on higher floor but still the smell of the food court when the balcony door be open but hey keep it close not a problem .<ssssss>really close to the action of the marketplace and food court .<ssssss>go for the upgrade its worth it.ian debbie<ssssss>
5 5 5 4 5 2 5 -1		posh resort this trip start out very rocky .<ssssss>when we arrive my best friend and i with my father , we be tell that there be only one room available for a undetermined amount of time .<ssssss>thankfully it be only for the night and besides that minor glitch the week be amazing .<ssssss>beautiful beach and pool .<ssssss>amazing food .<ssssss>older crowd though , we be 18 and there be definitely not very many teenager there that speak english although we do make friend .<ssssss>the nightlife on the resort be almost non-existent .<ssssss>the lobby bar shut down at midnight and people move into the fun pub which never have more than 15 people in it at once .<ssssss>other than that it be great service and a beautiful resort that i would definitely go back to .<ssssss>

5 5 3 5 4 5 5 3		unique hutong stay in beijing i have a some qualm about add another great review , but ... this be a unique , intimate inn from the qing dynasty , right in the middle of a residential beij hutong not too far from wangfuje and the forbid city .<ssssss>there be only a few room , each different , outfittedwith traditional furniture surround atmospheric garden courtyard in gracious chinese style .<ssssss>once you enter it be truly a different world from the noise , pollution and hectic pace outside .<ssssss>you feel like you be step back in time to a beijing that be rapidly disappear .<ssssss>the room include a free internet hookup .<ssssss>minibar and laundry price be extremely reasonable , room be clean and comfortable , the plumbing be modern and work well , the staff be great , you get a simple , yet homemade breakfast , you can rent bike ... what else can i say?obviously if you be look for a large hotel with room service , restaurant , shopping and glitz , this be not the place to stay .<ssssss>i alsowould not recommend it for those who have trouble walk or get around since there be step and threshold to navigate .<ssssss>but if you be even a little bit adventurous you will find it a rewarding experience.as other review have mention , taxi driver tend to puzzle over the address , even use the hotel 's address card .<ssssss>i opt for the airport pickup on arrival -- pricier than a taxi but absolutely hassle-free .<ssssss>when return to the hotel by taxi i suggest get drop off at the intersection of dongsinan and dengcao hutong and make the short walk to the hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 2 2 3 4 4 -1		surprisingly old fashion we stay at ac bcn the last two night of we fabulous vacation .<ssssss>after spend the week in the heart of bear we want to relax near the beach.i have read lot positive comment on ac barcelona and expect it to be a modern design hotel and i must say i be very disappointed .<ssssss>the 13 floor pool and sunbathe area be great and the restaurant be ok -lrb- a bit expensive though -rrb- , but otherwise the hotel be surprisingly shabby , even old fashion .<ssssss>broken lobby table , rugged carpet , broken fire alarm hang on the wall - little thing that make a sloppy impression , we room be the greatest disappointment : stuffy smell , television be straight from the 80 's , cheapest possible cd player , we sea side view mean gray roof and wall ... the room have absolute nothing to do with design hotel , more like a very basic two star hotel in the countryside .<ssssss>so if you be a fan of design hotel and not book a junior suite , do not expect much from the room !<ssssss>

-rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>people review here seem to go on about the aveda bath product that be complimentary in the bathroom , but these seem nothing special and be just as those you get in any hotel â€?mini soap , shampoo , shower cap etcâ€?note that the bed arenâ€™t as big as you might expect for a double â€?anyone who be around 6â€ ?<ssssss>tall will find they foot hang out of the bottom of the bed !<ssssss>3 -rrb- service â€?complimetary breakfast be serve in the smart and modern bar area from 7 to 11am .<ssssss>there be no variation , but i find the food to be excellent â€?bagels , mini danish pastry , minus scone , minus muffin and plenty of tea , coffee , iced water and orange juice plus a free copy of the new york time .<ssssss>the buffet never run short on food and it be constantly restock so donâ€™t worry if you only get there at 10:50 â€?you wont go hungry !<ssssss>when you check out -lrb- 12:00 noon -rrb- , the hotel will store you bag free of charge until you be ready to pick they up .<ssssss>upon arrival in the lobby you will receive a nice bottle of ice cold water .<ssssss>we arrive a hour early for check-in -lrb- officially 3pm -rrb- but we be show straight to out room.summary â€ ?<ssssss>9 out of 10 -lrb- only for want of a bigger bed -rrb- .<ssssss>i really , genuinely canâ€™t fault this hotel ; the room , the locationâ€?all perfect !<ssssss>stay here be the icing on the cake for a great holiday .<ssssss>stay here before everyone else discover it and the price go up !<ssssss>i hope this be useful to anyone consider stay here !<ssssss>enjoy !<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 1 3 1 -1		do not do it !<ssssss>a friend of mine and i decide to take a getaway to the carribean .<ssssss>after hear that punta cana be nice and find a good deal at the caribe club princess , we decide to check it out .<ssssss>we book through the usa3000 website which turn out to be through apple tour .<ssssss>we flight be nice and we actually arrive ahead of schedule .<ssssss>we then be direct to the tourbus which take we to the resort .<ssssss>this be we first taste of dominican time with many to follow .<ssssss>the ride be suppose to be 10minute but turn out to be over 1hour .<ssssss>when we arrive at the resort , it seem like a nice place .<ssssss>the lobby be open air and very pretty .<ssssss>we be tell that we room would not be ready until 3pm so we grab a drink and sit on a couch .<ssssss>the clerk find we within 30 minute and tell we that the room be ready .<ssssss>we take the tram over to the room and when we enter the room we notice that the slide door to the balcony would not open or shut .<ssssss>the room be also old and run down .<ssssss>i wonder how the maid do not notice this or why she do not notify somebody to fix it prior to we arrival .<ssssss>we call the front desk and tell they of we situation .<ssssss>they say that they would send somebody to fix it .<ssssss>we try to wait but get bore .<ssssss>thank god we leave because we would have be sit there for 6hour .<ssssss>i have to make another call to get somebody there .<ssssss>this be only the begining .<ssssss>we attempt to eat at the buffet and it be nasty .<ssssss>we find the pizza , roll and fruit to be good so pretty much live on that all week .<ssssss>we chalk the door incident up as be a one time problem but boy do we learn .<ssssss>this place be not service friendly for the most part .<ssssss>the maid would clean we room daily -lrb- if that be what you want to call it -rrb- and take we dirty towel as they usually do-the only thing be that they forget to replace they .<ssssss>they also do not replace anything in the fridge include drinking water .<ssssss>so , i would make daily phone call to get these item .<ssssss>i have to start call early because they usually say they be on the way but do not appear for hour if at all .<ssssss>that be only after 2 or 3 more phone call for these item .<ssssss>we even try to tip well the first day and they still do not provide these necessary item .<ssssss>so save you money .<ssssss>at time i would go find a maid in the hall and ask for these item and they do not understand what you be ask for .<ssssss>the communication barrier be difficult in many way .<ssssss>the food at the restaurant be not much better than the stuff on the buffet .<ssssss>you have to make reservation with the concierge before 12pm and could only make they for 3 day at a time .<ssssss>we do not have the vip package -lrb- i think that mean you get towel in you room -rrb- so we have to pay $ 25 pp to eat in one of the so call better restaurant .<ssssss>we choose to eat in the seafood place .<ssssss>i have langastino -lrb- small lobster -rrb- and my friend have a shrimp meal .<ssssss>wow be we disappoint .<ssssss>they use margarine rather than butter-nasty .<ssssss>my friend shrimp plate be something that should have be serve with peel and devein shrimp .<ssssss>they come in a sauce unpeeled .<ssssss>how be you suppose to eat that ?<ssssss>so back to the buffet for pizza .<ssssss>we also be tell to eat at the crepe place so we try it .<ssssss>the food be not bad but the service be terrible .<ssssss>the one woman approach we table and appear to take we order .<ssssss>she do not speak english but we point , she nod yes and take we menu .<ssssss>i end up fight with the waiter after he yell at we .<ssssss>he tell we he take the order and not she .<ssssss>how be i suppose to know that ?<ssssss>i could go on about the quality of food but i think you get my point .<ssssss>we do meet a good bartender .<ssssss>calvin at the lobby bar .<ssssss>he take care of everybody include we and be very service oriented-one of the few in this resort .<ssssss>the apple tour rep at the resort be pityful .<ssssss>she give we a lot of wrong info about shopping and shuttle schedule and phone card so we be pretty much on we own .<ssssss>when we check out we bill end up be far more than we expect , when we ask for a itemize bill , i get a fight from the clerk .<ssssss>she be actually throw thing behind the counter .<ssssss>i be never so happy to leave a carribean island in my life and vow i will never go back .<ssssss>especially to this resort .<ssssss>if you be the type that like to stay on a resort for you whole vacation find a good one and stay there .<ssssss>there be nothing outside of that compound .<ssssss>the shopping be terrible .<ssssss>the people be try to get you into they shop and will actually touch you .<ssssss>this completely turn I off .<ssssss>the island have many less

2 1 4 4 4 2 2 5		the club floor be not worth it !!!<ssssss>we stay at this hotel for one night in preparation for we flight the next day out of lax .<ssssss>we stay on the club floor at a tune of $ 259 per night .<ssssss>afternoon hor doeuvre be not plentiful .<ssssss>watch out for the senior stay on the club floor ; they eat everything in site make a meal with the hor doeuvre leave nothing for simple folk like ourselves who be not use to fight for food in a club lounge .<ssssss>breakfast be the same chaotic manner with the senior fight for the club lounge food ... it be a sight to see.nice bed , outdated bathroom with faucet the oldest that i have ever see .<ssssss>free internet in the club lounge with free printing-nice !<ssssss>airport shuttle stop at the marriott first so if the bus be full it simply pass by the renaissance without pick anyone up and you have to wait again.suggestion for future traveler ... simply try to avoid landing and take off from lax ... not too much choice for luxury hotel in the lax area .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 3 5 -1		castle inn - great location we stop here for 4 night .<ssssss>i book directly with the inn and they be easy to deal with .<ssssss>they respond quickly to all my email query and be very helpful .<ssssss>on arrival i be a bit put out , as the room look a bit dark and shabby .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be limit , and some room will suffer from traffic noise .<ssssss>however , the maid service be very good and the location be spot on .<ssssss>it be easily walkable to fisherman wharf and the bus and cable car be just a few minute walk away .<ssssss>there be also plenty of place to eat and some small shop just minute away .<ssssss>get to any where from here be easy .<ssssss>the front desk staff also let we know the place to go and where not to venture and they also give we map and a great list of bus to use to get to see all the sight .<ssssss>overall , the inn be good value for money , location be excellent and we enjoy we stay .<ssssss>
4 4 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		not bad just stay one night at hilton time square .<ssssss>the room be nice , comfortable bed etc. however , i would like to warn you that the hotel be located in one of the busiest street of ny , so it be quite noisy .<ssssss>in addition , i think the breakfast buffet be below 4 star standard and the service -lrb- especially concierge -rrb- could be better .<ssssss>
2 5 5 5 5 5 3 1		check you credit card bill we stay in the lafayette for three night in september , the hotel be lovely and we have a great time we fully intend to go back again next year , on leave the hotel we bill be settle in full , we be very surprise when two month later two charge be apply to we credit card amounting to almost $ 600 dollar , we call the hotel on four occasion and be tell that the manager g schumann would get back to we , she never do , we be then tell that she would e-mail we but she never do , we finally get most of the money refund back to we credit card and on the same day another charge of over $ 400 dollar be add on to the card again finally i get to speak to the manager but she be of no help , i have now have to report the unauthorised charge to the fraud department of my credit card company and they be investigate , the situation be still ongoing and i have not even have a apology for all the inconvienience and stress the situation have cause I .<ssssss>i be really sad that we have be treat in this way and there be no way that i would go back there now i just would not trust they with my credit card again .<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 4 -1 -1 -1		beautiful location ... but service sure be not what it should be ... i stay 3 night in the ali'i tower , which be nice , but probably not worth a return trip .<ssssss>it be close to the beach , have its own pool -lrb- quite small , but a very nice sundeck -rrb- and a nice continental breakfast each morning from 6:30 -10 .<ssssss>they charge $ 14 , although i receive it free with my amex platinum card .<ssssss>i be not sure i would have pay $ 14/day otherwise .<ssssss>the two lady who work there in the morning be lovely .<ssssss>the room be nice , have flat screen tv , a comfortable bed and couch , and nice lanai .<ssssss>it do include coffee and water , which apparently some of the other tower do not .<ssssss>they be suppose to come with turn-down service each night where they restock , but i need to specifically ask for it 2 of the 3 night .<ssssss>eventually they do come , so all 's well that end well.i laugh at how hard the property try to keep you on site .<ssssss>between all the restaurant , shop , and the nice strip of beach , you really would never have to leave.the retailer be top of the line -lrb- loui vuitton , maui diver , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>the people who work there be lovely and professional -lrb- esp cindy in maui diver and both laura and laurie in loui -rrb- .<ssssss>however , i will say that everyone associate with the hotel be a little strained .<ssssss>no smile or friendly greeting , a reluctant doorman , awkward bell service where you can not call ahead for you car but need to bring they the ticket and then just stand there and wait for it ... it all detract from the absolutely beautiful property with they pink flamingo and cute little penguin .<ssssss>one of the manager tell I that hotel be recently downgrade to 3 star because of poor service .<ssssss>i find that very tell .<ssssss>they should definitely take some lesson from the retailers.so , all in all , i get a great rate and perfect location for what i need , but for vacation or personal trip , i will likely not be a return visitor .<ssssss>
3 2 1 5 3 4 3 -1		great lobby , 4 star room i plan to stay at the grand hyatt for 5 night and i leave after the first one .<ssssss>the hotel be great when it come to the common area -lrb- lobby , live music and a fantastic japanese restaurant -rrb- but the room -lrb- and i check at least 5 of they -rrb- be just good for a 4 start average city hotel in europe .<ssssss>this be the second time that i have this problem with a hyatt , the other be in casablanca .<ssssss>again , great lobby , disappointing room .<ssssss>
3 4 2 5 2 4 4 2		ok for the price i guess i should not expect more than just a room in honolulu when only pay $ 89 for a partial ocean view .<ssssss>the room be small , the bathroom small , and the bed be a queen -lrb- a king would not fit -rrb- .<ssssss>they do have air conditioning , and a nice staff .<ssssss>i never do go to the pool or the bar .<ssssss>the area be right where all the shopping be located and the street be quite .<ssssss>so if you be look for a bargain then this be a good place , it remind I of a small motel 6 .<ssssss>

a walk on the beach to the riu .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful , fine sand and wave .<ssssss>the water be not as clear as the picture and there be wave therefore seaweed do not expect that .<ssssss>if you be look for caribbean water this be not it .<ssssss>however the water be cool so it be refresh when you get in .<ssssss>they do clean the beach every morning .<ssssss>i be up and on the beach at 7 everyday.best time to be there peaceful and quiet .<ssssss>you do not need to get up early for a hut there be plenty .<ssssss>however , if you want to be in the front on the water yes you need to get up early .<ssssss>8 : am at the latest .<ssssss>people do get up early and leave there stuff on the chair .<ssssss>one thing if you want non motorized water sport they be free for one hour a day not many people know that .<ssssss>but make reservation in advance they book quick , especially the sailing .<ssssss>we do not run into one mosquito we have 4 bottle of off and forget to bring they but do

2 1 2 5 4 5 2 2		better deal around the corner i book we hotel through expedia for only 2 night , just in case i do not like the hotel .<ssssss>i be glad that i do , too .<ssssss>i suggest that anyone thinking of stay here go around the corner -lrb- 2 min walk -rrb- to hotel inglaterra .<ssssss>here 's why :1 .<ssssss>we hotel room be freezing cold , colder inside than out , it seem .<ssssss>i call the front desk to make sure i be operate the a/c correctly and be instruct over the phone what setting to put it on .<ssssss>the room be still freezing the next day , so someone come up and tell I that i have actually turn the thing off .<ssssss>i do not think either be correct because i try every possible setting , the temp be as high as i could set it , and we room be cold the entire time .2 .<ssssss>the wireless internet be expensive , 15 euro per day per computer .<ssssss>i pay for the internet and yet i could not get a signal .<ssssss>the front desk do rectify this problem by send I up some big clunky antenna .<ssssss>it work , but still annoying .<ssssss>when use a laptop , the less wire the better , right ?<ssssss>3 .<ssssss>the hotel room be very mediocre .<ssssss>it be not 4 star and definitely not worth the price .<ssssss>the room be boring .<ssssss>i be not super into decor or anything , but it be basically furnish like a motel 6 or something .<ssssss>it be clean , but very basic .<ssssss>the television be old and do not work properly.this hotel be not terrible , but it be just ok .<ssssss>i highly recommend go around the corner to hotel inglaterra , where i stay for the rest of my trip .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 3 -1 4 -1		highway robbery i choose the sofitel for my recent stay in new york , base on its trip advisor popularity.the hotel be new and the accomodation be pretty good .<ssssss>the staff be always pleasant , but not that efficient.but several thing be not as good as i would have expected.even though the bathroom be beautiful , the sink be crack and the shower do not drain properly.their tv e-mail be slow and not user-friendly .<ssssss>but the really unforgivable part be they phone system .<ssssss>they charge I $ 15,46 for a one minute call to argentina -lrb- probably several hundred time they cost -rrb- and they also try to charge I for several call that have not be completed.to make thing worse , they phone system be set up so that i be unable to use a toll-free phone card i have .<ssssss>i get a busy signal every time i try and waste a lot of time try .<ssssss>i step outside to a pay phone and get through immediately.that be why my review be title highway robbery.if i go to new york again , i will try another hotel .<ssssss>

4 5 4 5 4 5 5 2		modern flair in old madrid in a perfect location for a first or return visit to madrid -- close to the 3 major museum , plaza mayor , a ton of shop and restaurant and around the corner from the place cervante -lrb- allegedly -rrb- die as well as the home -lrb- museum -rrb- of the prolific writer de vega -lrb- worth the short guide tour even if you do not speak a word of spanish -rrb- -- room on the street have great ` french ' door but be warn that madrillino stay up all night and make lot of noise !<ssssss>we get move to a room in the back which be stuffy but very quiet .<ssssss>the modern design and amenity add to the pleasure of stay here ; all the hotel staff be helpful in every way -- could use a coffe/tea maker in the room and more clothing storage , but other than that i would highly recommend this hotel .<ssssss>also , the bed be very comfortable with well make , cotton , bedding .<ssssss>decor be relax<ssssss>
1 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		hate this hotel husa oriente this be the worst hotel that we have stay in barcelona.the room be freezing i feel lke i be stay in the ice palace.when we complain to reception we be tell that it be too soon in the year for the heating to be turn on but my complaint would be pass on to the manager but nothing be done.yes the hotel be in a good location but there be plenty in this spot where we have stay before , which be cheaper and mile better.the reception staff be cold and unfriendly and have i not pay for my stay upfront i would have check out and stay somewhere else .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 1 2 3 -1		need a bit of tweaking my boyfriend and i stay at this hotel for 6 night , so i think i have a pretty good idea of whether it be a good hotel or not .<ssssss>i will break it down into pro and con , since there be quite a few of each : pro : great location for catch bus , streetcar and cable car ; great location for late night dining ; the bed be super comfortable ; they have the room ready for we when we check in at 9 a.m.cons : the woman on the phone tell I there be no way that they would have the room ready that early and be quite rude .<ssssss>housekeeping would call we to ask if we want we room clean , even if we have a do not disturb sign on the door - what if we be take a nap ?<ssssss>it be because housekeeping leaf at 4 everyday so you can not get anything after that time .<ssssss>there be a pink stain on my comforter when we get there .<ssssss>we use the same sheet for 4 night , then i leave the please wash these sheet sign on the bed so they would change the sheet -lrb- clean they -rrb- .<ssssss>the pink stain be still there when we get home and we sheet have be clean , which mean they do not change the sheet when you be there or in between guest .<ssssss>this , to I , be a very , very big con .<ssssss>gross !<ssssss>the room be really noisy because the hotel be old , so you could hear other guest take shower , etc. they claim they will have tea and coffee in the morning , but they never have hot water for tea .<ssssss>there be no minibar so you can never take food back to you hotel to put in a fridge .<ssssss>we toilet do not flush right -lrb- it keep flush for about 20 minute -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all , if this hotel be $ 70 a night , i would be rave , but for over $ 200 , it be absolutely insane .<ssssss>we even have a royal court room , which be more expensive , because they give you one-dollar slipper and a bust up coffee machine .<ssssss>i hear the donatello be really nice and it be just down the street ...<ssssss>
1 3 2 -1 1 -1 3 -1		never again .<ssssss>i be sorry ... but i go here on the rating of trip advisor and i be very disappointed .<ssssss>first , the room i receive be so small .<ssssss>i have see small room , but this one be awful .<ssssss>second , my sheet be stain .<ssssss>this be unacceptable .<ssssss>third , the room be sooooo hot.i nicely tell the front desk after one night that i be go to check out .<ssssss>they offer to give I another room , but i decline and walk across the street to the conrad tokyo , which although 12,000 more yen a night , it be 3 time better !!<ssssss>buyer beware.on the plus side ... good view and nice lobby .<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 5 3 4 3		good place , unsavoury area the room itself be clean , spacious and well decorate .<ssssss>at time it be quite noisy because it be right beside 9th street however it be never bad enough to keep we awake .<ssssss>there be a fan in the room which keep the room cool enough , i do not think it really need aircon , -lrb- san francisco be not that warm ! -rrb-<ssssss>the breakfast be simple ; cereal , muffin , juice , coffee etc and be not in the reception but a special cafe.the staff be extremely helpful and anytime we need assistance they be more than willing to help.the area be not the nicest in the city .<ssssss>the civic center have a infamous problem with homelessness which be disconcert at first .<ssssss>however , it be the dark street in the somo area and the dirty sidewalk which actually make it unpleasant .<ssssss>this however be a fault with the area , not the hotel.it be about 6 block from the bart and right beside some muni stop .<ssssss>it be the opposite end of san francisco from fisherman 's wharf and the golden gate but be very near union square and the financial district .<ssssss>

4 3 5 -1 4 -1 5 -1		meet we expectation we stay at tapatio cliff four night in late march 2006 and enjoy it .<ssssss>pick it largely for the pool and be not disappoint .<ssssss>the steel drum and marimba duo be a pleasant surprise .<ssssss>lot of fountain -- all work .<ssssss>and the landscaping be immaculate .<ssssss>also , the small sunset pool and hot tub closer to we room be very nice and open late at night.this be a very hilly property , which help make it scenic , but i would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone not sure-footed , at least in the upper building .<ssssss>while we be generally able to park pretty close to we room , there be severe incline to navigate go to the car.as expect , there be a $ 10 daily charge for high-speed internet , which seem stingy for a hotel in this price range .<ssssss>we be also put off by the charge to use the exercise room .<ssssss>hilton should realize this kind of nickle-and-diming can take the luster off a otherwise very positive experience.if we return to phoenix , we will strongly consider this resort again .<ssssss>
5 5 3 3 5 5 5 3		`` a true sanctuary '' we have just arrive home from a 6 day stay at the sesari bali .<ssssss>my husband and i , we stay in a double-villa with we friend -lrb- another couple -rrb- .<ssssss>i have to say , that the concept be just great !<ssssss>both couple have a private bedroom with a bathroom , but share the living area and the pool in the middle .<ssssss>we have so much more fun toghether than we would have if we would stay in a hotel .<ssssss>we think that it be fantastic that the breakfast be serve in the villa every morning .<ssssss>every evening we fill in the list and time for breakfast to be serve .<ssssss>and , food be very nice .<ssssss>above all , all staff member be extemely friendly and the service be fast .<ssssss>there be also a good security in place.we try out the spa service , which be very reasonably price and relaxing .<ssssss>i can absolutely recommend the 60-minute indonesian massage .<ssssss>the pool be quite small , but deep , so we even play waterball .<ssssss>high wall between villa make sure that you neibourgh can not take a peak into you villa , so the place be a real sanctuary !<ssssss>: -rrb- if you be look at something different than a business hotel , this be it .<ssssss>and , it be even better when you can share it with you friend !!<ssssss>what we dislike , be the road lead to the sesari bali .<ssssss>it be in a real bad shape , but accord to daily papers that be the case in many place in indonesia .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 2 -1		like in a horror movie the moment i step in the hotel â€œlobbyâ€?i think it be a joke .<ssssss>this place canâ€™t be call a hotel .<ssssss>it look like a place be either under condemnation or complete remodeling .<ssssss>but one would think that they would not be allow to actually call it a hotel and rent out room .<ssssss>when i step into elevator i be start to fear what i be go to see as my room .<ssssss>on 18th floor , most of the roomâ€™s door be open with everything inside rip off .<ssssss>in the middle of this be my room .<ssssss>when open the door , i be actually horrify what i saw .<ssssss>just one detail - the door to the balcony be nail shut and everything look like it be some dorm room that have not be touch since 60 .<ssssss>my family , that stay at the different hotel have arrive to see it and do not allow I to stay at this place .<ssssss>i spend a night at they hotel and move to another one next day .<ssssss>i wish i have take photo .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 3 -1		great location , staff not very helpful the location be great !<ssssss>we stay 3 night in the beginning of may right after rome and before florence .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very nice and be right in the middle of of everything .<ssssss>it rain all 4 day we be there ... so that put a damper on we vacation in florence .<ssssss>the hotel have umbrella available for we which be great since i do not bring one .<ssssss>we arrive by taxi to the hotel -lrb- after the train ride of course -rrb- and have to check in .<ssssss>the man behind the desk be not helpful at all .<ssssss>he pretty much give we we key and say the bellman would help we to we room .<ssssss>we have to ask he what time breakfast be at .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be really good !<ssssss>overall the hotel be fine and the location be the best .<ssssss>i would probably stay there again .<ssssss>we come from a awesome trip from rome with the best front desk man so we have high expectation .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 5 4 3		good enough stay here for a long weekend .<ssssss>we get a good deal on the room price -lrb- $ 110.00 / night -rrb- for the location.the a/c do not work and we have to prop the window with a sturdy book .<ssssss>the window be very heavy .<ssssss>i notice other patron be creative in they window-propping ; a wooden coat-hanger for example.the bathroom be nice with marble vanity etc. other review complain of the smallness of the bathroom , but we find this to be okay .<ssssss>clean with good soap , shampoos.easy walk to underground tour and pike 's market .<ssssss>staff be real nice and let we check in early on a rainy day.the airport bus -lrb- grey line -rrb- shuttle right around the corner which be very convenient .<ssssss>free wifus !<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 -1 5 4 -1		tiny , tiny , tiny i be travel with my brother in law in a bussine t rip.when we arrive to the hotel we be nicely impressed : the lobby be very nice and the staff be very courteuos.thatÂ´s all falk .<ssssss>as soon as we open we room door we want to run as far as we could from this hotel , and believe I thatÂ´s what weÂ´ve done.the room be so small that if you be travel with more than a backpack its not enough room in there to even get around to go to the bathroom.the manager be so use to the traveler complaint for this reason that he allow we to resign we reservation without charge we any penalty.we move to the holliday inn , one block away , and we only pay u $ 5 more a day and the room be 3 time bigger than the kowloon .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 4 5 5 4		okura be average , certainly not 5 star i be curious to see how this hotel would turn out give that previous reviewer either rave about it and recommend the service and excellent staff , or be highly critical and comment on the dated appearance and strange smell !<ssssss>my experience be that both be correct .<ssssss>the staff be very courteous and helpful , there be plenty of amenity and the location be convenient with a easy tram ride into the center of the city and a selection of restaurant and shop within 5 minute walk .<ssssss>however , my room have the previously report ' strange smell ' -lrb- and it be a non-smoking room -rrb- and the decor be very 1970s , in the worst sense .<ssssss>give other review , i suspect that there be some more modern renovate room and that these be significantly more expensive .<ssssss>i be also disappoint at the premium charge that be slap on everything , such as internet access -lrb- there be wifi available for 25 euro per day -rrb- and the bar and restaurant be expensive .<ssssss>i certainly would not rate it as a 5 star hotel ; more like 3-4 star .<ssssss>major renovation be need to drag it out of the 70 .<ssssss>
3 4 2 1 3 4 5 3		lovely staff , nice hotel but ... .<ssssss>we stay at breeze punta cana for two week in september 2006 .<ssssss>let I start by say that there be some aspect of this holiday that my husband and i absolutely love .<ssssss>the staff be the most friendly that we have have meet anywhere .<ssssss>they be always smile and rush to serve we at meal time and in the evening for drink .<ssssss>they be not pay very much but they be always laugh , dancing and singing .<ssssss>even though it be company policy not to tip they a discreet dollar here or there do no harm.the speciality restaurant be wonderful .<ssssss>we always manage to get a reservation , there be no problem at all and it be like go out to a nice restaurant every night - dress up a bit and be look after by the lovely waiter and waitress - we wine glass be never empty .<ssssss>the animation team work hard - again long hour and be again extremely friendly and do they best to entertain everyone.there be problem in this hotel though .<ssssss>we room be very musty and the smell do not go off at all .<ssssss>the sheet and towel be very much second hand - sometimes the sheet do not even fit the bed .<ssssss>there be also security problem .<ssssss>it seem to we that load of different people have key to the room .<ssssss>one afternoon whilst we be change for afternoon tea , a woman in a white uniform just walk in without knock , when she realise we be in the room she could not get away quickly enough !<ssssss>also one night we room have be search while we be at dinner - we know this because item have be move around and the bathroom door have be shut - we leave it open .<ssssss>.<ssssss>after make a complaint the hotel send we up a bottle of champagne as a way of say sorry -lrb- which be very nice of they -rrb- and they up the security on we floor .<ssssss>we lock everything of value in the safe anyway , even my perfume , so no-one could get to it.we also have have upset stomach , the food hygeine obviously leave alot to be desire .<ssssss>everybody we speak to have have the same .<ssssss>we have be home over a week and have still not recover from we stomach bug which start about 5 day into the stay !<ssssss>one couple be so bad that they end up in hospital on drip and be try to get home a week early be willing to pay Â£500 to do so!although not totally relevent to the hotel i would like to share this next experience with you .<ssssss>i too have a trip to the hospital/medical centre - oh boy !<ssssss>where do i start .<ssssss>i break my toe on the leg of the bed in we room , it just need strap up with a bit of tape but the dr in the medical room in the hotel insist i go and have a x ray .<ssssss>he be just be over cautious i guess .<ssssss>the hospital be very poor , the sheet on the bed i be ask to lie on be dirty !<ssssss>i do not stay on it for long .<ssssss>the x ray be quickly perform and the a dr come out and just tape the toe together !<ssssss>which be what i want in the first place!our nightmare begin after my treatment .<ssssss>we be lead into a admin office and immediately feel intimidate .<ssssss>a member of staff inspect we insurance doc and then insist upon we hand over money to they , we be later tell by we insurance company we should not have give they anything !<ssssss>they would not take cash or traveller cheque and take we credit card , they swipe it on a machine , also take a indentation of it and also take it away to photocopy it - needless to say we cancel it the moment we get home !!<ssssss>all i would say if you be go to this hotel be : understand insurance procedure before goingtake plenty of rehydration pack and immodium with youtake micro pore and plasterstake insect repellent - deet be bestdrink load of watertake plenty of one dollar bill for discreet tippingif you go prepare for anything then you can relax and enjoy the holiday .<ssssss>we love the hotel and the people and although we would not go there again we have a good time .<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		would only recommend if cost be biggest factor advantage : short walk to 30-minute ferry that take you to central and kowloon ; very scenic ; clean bed ; helpful staffdisadvantage : although on same island as the airport , far , twist 45 minute car ride to the hotel from the airport ; 2-star tired look room and facility ; no heat while i be there which make the room like a icebox .<ssssss>i would not recommend this place unless you be a cost-conscious backpacker or planning on a very short stay , and look only for a place to sleep and if you be not plan on spending much time at the hotel .<ssssss>

2 1 3 4 3 5 3 5		not so much ... .<ssssss>ok , iâ€™ll make this pretty simple but iâ€™ll be sure to be as detail as possible .<ssssss>we be a young couple in we late 20 's who visit the dr and this hotel specifically for a close friend 's wedding .<ssssss>we just get back this week .<ssssss>my feeling be confirm in that i would never opt to stay at a all inclusive for the reason ill lay out below .<ssssss>we be very well travel , and have be to many resort in the past , so we a lot to compare this to .<ssssss>i know people tend to be very picky on these review after spend a lot of money per night at a resortâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>my below review have nothing to do with what we paidâ€?i would write the same review if we stay at a airport marriott and pay $ 100 a nightâ€?this be the first review i have write because i just want to warn people what they be walk into .<ssssss>the resort be beautiful , the water be very pretty from afar and the room be niceâ€?the staff be also very nice .<ssssss>as you get closer to the water or into the water you will see the abundance of seaweed and sea grassâ€?not the end of the world , but certainly not the most welcome beach .<ssssss>service be really niceâ€?we bring a ton of $ 1â€™s and hand they out pretty regularlyâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>itâ€™s a very poor island , so it be much appreciate .<ssssss>for some reason the toiletâ€™s have clear glass door on they in the room , and then the bathroom be pretty much open to the rest of the roomâ€ $ e prepare to get very close with whoever you be share a room with because there be no privacy .<ssssss>you hear , smell , and know everything that be go on in the bathroom if you be in the main part of the hotel room .<ssssss>we have a ocean view which be great and well worth the extra money -lrb- i would not opt for the royal service as it seem to be a way to squeeze you for more money with limited benefit -rrb- .<ssssss>all this be great , but to I , eat be a major part of survival and a major part of have a nice vacation .<ssssss>to say that the food be atrocious would be put it mildly .<ssssss>iâ€™ll be honest , i be a bit of a food snob in that i like to actually eat thing that be edibleâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>iâ€™ve eat at some of the finest restaurant in the country and can still find enjoyment with a hot dog off a street cart , so iâ€™m just look for something that be eatableâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>iâ€™ve have better buffet experience at the local 7/11 where at least the nachoâ€™s and hot dogâ€™s taste like food and not shoe leather and blood .<ssssss>the meat be so repulsive that the fact that itâ€™s call a hamburger be shocking in its own way .<ssssss>bana the tepen-yaki joint would have be fine , but they cook the food until you couldnâ€™t recognize it anymore .<ssssss>nao and market grill be the only 2 lunch optionsâ€?market grill be actually the most eatable option in the resort. , â€?this be due mostly to the fact that the cook who run the flat top actually have some sort of culinary training .<ssssss>he know how to make a skirt steak and its semi decent -lrb- again , i wouldnâ€™t pay $ 5 buck for this in the we , but in comparison to rest of the resort this be like eat at arnie mortonâ€™s ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>dinnerâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>wow be this rough .<ssssss>apparently there be one kitchen between all 4 â€œupscaleâ€?dinner dinning option .<ssssss>the restaurant be all surround this one kitchen and its all really the same food dress up to look ethnic for each different themeâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>fine , i can deal with that if the food be actually foodâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>but , i wouldnâ€™t serve my dog what be serve to I .<ssssss>weâ€™re talk about food that be obviously cook at 5:00 pm , hold in chaff dish , and then literally microwave -lrb- i know this because the chicken be cold to the touch , but when you cut it open it explode with steam -rrb- .<ssssss>vento be disgust !<ssssss>donâ€™t eat thereâ€?passion be even worse .<ssssss>i eat pasta and rice for 6 day until i begged my wife to go with I to hard rock cafÃ© at they sister hotelâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>i have to eat enough at hard rock to hold I the rest of the week .<ssssss>even the bread at this hotel be awful .<ssssss>breakfast be probably the safest out of the 3 mealsâ€?youâ€™re safe with egg and pancakesâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>hard to mess that up .<ssssss>all and all we have a great time because we have a lot of friend there and drink a enormous amount of booze .<ssssss>i guess we make up for what we didnâ€™t eat with what we drink .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t get physically sick from the food -lrb- but emotionally i be damage -rrb- , so i guess thatâ€™s also a bonus .<ssssss>i wouldnâ€™t go back for the food reason and because i think there be just way too many beautiful place in the caribbean which arenâ€™t 3rd world country .<ssssss>

5 3 5 4 5 3 3 5		westin in the way to go i do my research so know what to expect both good and bad .<ssssss>most of the bad stuff do not really apply to I like the sink and mirror situation .<ssssss>when i first arrive at the hotel via super shuttle , i be drop off at the corner .<ssssss>i have one bag and my back pack .<ssssss>i enter the ground floor lobby area through a turnstile doorway which be kind of tricky with luggage .<ssssss>i proceed to the reception desk and check in .<ssssss>i be offer a room upgrade on the top floor with a outstanding view of downtown and the empire state building .<ssssss>i could not ask for more .<ssssss>the room have all the usual westin thing like starbuck coffee , water bottle , glassware and fully stock minibar .<ssssss>the only thing that be miss be the shampoo and conditioner so i call the service express number and three set be send up within ten minute .<ssssss>there be two elevator bank .<ssssss>elevator bank a be from floor 2-23 and elevator bank b be from 2-45 .<ssssss>since my room be on the 45th floor , i have to use the second bank .<ssssss>the westin club be locate on the 8th floor be they provide breakfast and evening snack daily .<ssssss>this be free due to my starwood status .<ssssss>you could gain access via the club level category room which be about $ 100 more than the other room .<ssssss>there be only one restaurant in the hotel .<ssssss>i do not eat here but do have a couple of drink at they bar .<ssssss>the bar tender , brian , be very helpful and kind .<ssssss>there be also another bar next to the lobby , bar 10 , that be basically a extension to the lobby .<ssssss>it be close off prior to noon which only leave the small area in front of reception for people to sit .<ssssss>i personally do not like this option and think that both area should be open to the guest at all time .<ssssss>i have see this in most westin hotel .<ssssss>the people work the bell desk do not seem overly friendly .<ssssss>but than again , i be in new york where friendliness be not a norm .<ssssss>if you have to choose a hotel in the time square area , this hotel would be a very good choice .<ssssss>it be close to everything and yet far enough away from all the noise that you would find closer to broadway and 7th avenue .<ssssss>the immediate area around the hotel be kind of tacky , but there be some good deli 's , fast food and even a nice jazz bar around the corner .<ssssss>i would definitely stay here again and recommend it for singles or family .<ssssss>i guess on my next trip to the city , i will have to decide between the w time square and this hotel .<ssssss>

3 3 4 4 4 1 3 3		not convince about the marco polo we stay at the marco polo from 12/9 to 17/9 2006 .<ssssss>on check in we be extremely frustrated -lrb- especially after travel such a long distance from the uk -rrb- that they have allocate we a twin smoking room .<ssssss>we then enter into a rather protracted and tired conversation to try and obtain a double room -lrb- as this be what have be book and it be we honeymoon ! -rrb-<ssssss>and a non-smoking room .<ssssss>at one point we be tell we would have to wait a further 2-3 hour to check in to get such a room -lrb- we arrive at about 4.30 pm which be not particularly early -rrb- but the reception desk then manage to find we a room .<ssssss>unfortunately the whole experience taint the start of we visit as we do not really feel as if they be try to help we - if we have not have push so hard for the room change i doubt we would have get anything out of they .<ssssss>the room be spacious -lrb- though we end up with two single bed push together with two single duvet ! -rrb-<ssssss>and well equipped but overall the hotel lack a ambience .<ssssss>ok it do everything it be suppose to do , the location be great for the harbour view -lrb- make sure you get one of these room as it be amazing -rrb- and it have great access to the star ferry which take you into central hong kong .<ssssss>there be also some nice restaurant next door in the shopping centre which offer a great view over the harbour which be great at night .<ssssss>overall a good hotel but it lack ambience and character , and , the check in experience leave a lot to be desire .<ssssss>
1 2 2 4 4 3 1 1		good location , ok price , useless staff and lot of problem !!<ssssss>4 star it be not !<ssssss>as many have already say , the hotel be indeed in a good location , even though itâ€™s down some narrow alley and not on the main road where just a few yard away sit the best hotel in town .<ssssss>the room size be ok .<ssssss>the deluxe room be a little roomier .<ssssss>the room decor be contemporary and simple .<ssssss>now for the problem some of which have be mention by other in this forum and for which i learn the hard way for not listen to they advice .<ssssss>i do not normally write review , but i hope by share this info , when you book you hotel , you will avoid these problem .1 / room have no soundproofing .<ssssss>you will hear everything and i mean everything .<ssssss>2 / if you get a street face room , do not expect any quiet ... we arrive on saturday , and the first room i get be on the 4 floor and face out .<ssssss>the noise last till about 4am .<ssssss>with truck , trash collection , people , you name it .<ssssss>it sound like they be in the room with we .3 / there be free internet in the room , but you need to bring you own cable .<ssssss>so i go and buy one when i find out rather than pay the 17 euro daily charge for wifus .<ssssss>4 / the expedia site show this hotel claim it have parking .<ssssss>it do not .<ssssss>however , there be public parking nearby but you will pay a 20 euro a day rate -lrb- but you must tell the car park to give you the hotel rate , otherwise they will charge you full rate -rrb- 5 / bed be uncomfortable ... and the one pillow you each get be useless .<ssssss>but if you ask for more they will give you more .<ssssss>6 / when i book the hotel , i book two room and make a request that they be next to each other .<ssssss>instead , i get two room on opposite side of the hotel .<ssssss>and wait for this , while both room be on the same floor , the hotel be a utter mess in the way its split up .<ssssss>it seem that it must have be several building put together or something as no sane person would design something so stupid .<ssssss>to get to we room , we have to take the elevator to the first floor .<ssssss>then , go to the end of the hall way and take another elevator to the 4 floor .<ssssss>to get to the suppose adjoining room , we need to go the 1st floor and take a different elevator to the 4 floor as there be no way to simply walk from we 4th floor room to the other .<ssssss>we complain the next morning about the noise and the distance of the two room as we be travel with young child and this be not really workable.the next day they change we room to the inside courtyard which eliminate the street noise .<ssssss>however , the room where still way apart from each other , about 20 room or so .<ssssss>we get we room but where tell the door key donâ€™t ' work , so we have to request front desk to come open the door anytime we want to get into the room .<ssssss>they do promise to fix it the next day and that they do .<ssssss>when i get back to the room that evening i be frustrate to find the internet in the room do not work especially after have buy a cable the day before .<ssssss>i try both room we have and neither work .<ssssss>complain to management , they keep promise to fix it .<ssssss>they never do .<ssssss>in the end we test it in other room on that floor and it do not work there either , not even with different cable or computer .<ssssss>i tell they it seem they have a problem with the floor ; they do not care much and simply blame it on they internet service provider , which be typical .<ssssss>another complaint i have be that the staff donâ€™t ' make any effort to make you stay pleasant and comfortable .<ssssss>room service if you can get through to they have a attitude .<ssssss>you order thing , half the order come and then they claim you never order the other half .<ssssss>then you have to go back and forth with they and get attitude about it!this hotel simply do not know the meaning of the customer be always right!at the end of the day , this hotel be not worth the price pay nor do it deserve 4 star .<ssssss>i have stay in 4 and 5 star hotel all around the world and this hotel be not up to any of those standard .<ssssss>cosmetically it may match some lower end 4 star establishment but thatâ€™s about it .<ssssss>next time , iâ€™ll pay that little bit extra and stay at a real hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		a alright stay we stay at the casablanca and be disapoint when we reach we room to find 2 double bed rather than the king we be suppose to get as it be for a romantic getaway , also we be suppose to get a ocean view but end up get a view of the top of palm tree .<ssssss>we find that the staff be not very friendly or helpful .<ssssss>when we check out they try tell we that we have not pay for valet parking yet -lrb- which we have previously -rrb- so we end up pay for parking twice .<ssssss>the elevator be break so we have to use the one for staff only which look wear down with cardboard on the wall .<ssssss>the beach be fantastic but when look up from the beach to the hotel you will notice the back of the hotel need to be paint , the entire back wall be nothing but one big paint chip .<ssssss>the pool area be pretty decent .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 2 5 3		a excellent stay i end up stay at this hotel because i need a room for a week at short notice - one of those sight-unseen bookings.the hotel itself be very nice .<ssssss>there be construction go on - but it be never intrusive , never a problem .<ssssss>i find the staff to be 50/50 between nice and helpful - and snotty and superior .<ssssss>the lady bartender should be avoid whenever possible.i have a room on the 27th floor with a excellent view towards coit tower .<ssssss>the room be large , well appoint , and bed be wonderful .<ssssss>the shower be very nice - and the shower head be high enough for I -lrb- i be 6 ' 4 -rrb- .<ssssss>the housekeeping crew keep the room immaculate , and they just seem to pop in at the proper time to straighten thing up .<ssssss>the only negative would be juggle the temperature to keep it constant.the hotel be very convenient - walk distance to the moscone center , two block to chinatown , quite a bit of reasonable dining within easy walk distance.if i ever need to stay in that area again - i would certainly go back to hotel 480 .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 2 4 3 2		disappointing experience , great location we stay at rialto on a saturday late october for 2 night , a double -lrb- twin bed push together -rrb- on 6th floor .<ssssss>arrive early morning and staff be happy to store we luggage until we room be ready around 2pm , and also give we breakfast voucher for that day which be nice .<ssssss>there be two small lift in the main lobby with a third which only go to 5th floor .<ssssss>one lift be out of action by saturday afternoon , the second die on sunday morning and apparently service be not available until monday .<ssssss>it be virtually impossible to get the remain lift to respond .<ssssss>we room be clean but very small .<ssssss>the air conditioning be very noisy so we do not use it , and there be a distinct odour of drain in the bathroom -lrb- which have be renovate - it look great but do not smell too good -rrb- .<ssssss>no refrigerator either.the staff after a good start be not particularly helpful.overall we experience at the rialto be disappointing but it be in a great position in the old town area .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 3 1 3		be prepare we stay a week at the hilton garden inn hotel.we find the room very clean upon check-in and in good condition .<ssssss>the best feature of this property be the fact that it be one of the quietest hotel we have visit -lrb- good soundproofing between the wall , no door-slamming in the hallway -rrb- .<ssssss>however ... we find quite a number of front desk employee -lrb- not all -rrb- to be rude and disinterested and housekeeping left much to be desire -lrb- one night they make up the bed without any fitted bottom sheet at all , one night they do not even clean the room , and one night they do not place any towel in the room -rrb- .<ssssss>valet parking be $ 20.00 per night but be careful because they will leave you car on the street for hour .<ssssss>self parking be $ 15.00 per night but after 6pm you be lucky to find a space in the parking garage .<ssssss>apparently , the hotel rent space for special event/concert parking and also allow patron to a large bar beside the hotel -lrb- metro bar -rrb- to park in they parking facility -lrb- charge they , of course -rrb- so there be precious few parking space in the three story garage attach to the hotel.we be very pleased at the beginning of we stay but the longer we stay the more problem we find and , quite frankly , we would not go back primarily because of the rude front desk employee we encounter .<ssssss>
3 3 4 4 4 1 4 -1		lovely holiday !<ssssss>.<ssssss>the beach<ssssss>
3 3 3 -1 1 -1 4 -1		a so so westin experience my husband and i be platinum preferred starwood guest and have the good fortune of stay at many beautiful starwood property .<ssssss>this property be not one of we favorite .<ssssss>the room be a bit odd , and not very clean .<ssssss>housekeeping be less than perfect ... many hair be find on the sheet upon arrival , and on the bathroom floor .<ssssss>this be a tropical environment , however we be greet by a colony of tiny non-biting ant in we room upon arrival .<ssssss>the food be fair to good .<ssssss>if you can exist on black bean soup than you should be fine .<ssssss>otherwise , plan to hit the several burger king you pass on the way to the resort .<ssssss>because , find good native food remain a mystery to we still .<ssssss>the hotel seem to recognize and capatlize on its guest as captive reality , and offer high price poor quality food and drink .<ssssss>of course , as mention , the black bean soup be actually very good , as be the churassco .<ssssss>the beach be actually quite good , very pretty with plenty of towel and nice lounge chair .<ssssss>the gym be not good , and super-hot .<ssssss>plus , the blase electronica make work out a possible panic attack .<ssssss>the captive bird as lobby decor be quite depressing , and we be dissapoint to find a starwood property embrace animal cruelty.finally , the worst problem with this property be the location , it be truly in the middle of a long depressing road line with burger king and ramshackle shop .<ssssss>we would explore other option closer to san juan if we return .<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 4 -1 5 -1		would i drop $ 500 ?<ssssss>no .<ssssss>maybe $ 300.00 my wife and i enjoy 6 nite at the ritz in san juan .<ssssss>we stay on company business .<ssssss>i would say its a excellent choice for the gambler who want 3 nite in jan or feb at about $ 300 per nite .<ssssss>it would not be worth $ 500 per nite on my income level .<ssssss>the hotel and service be excellent but the location and the beach be weak .<ssssss>the hotel be located next to the airport so you will wake up to that 7:30 be jet take off .<ssssss>the transfer back and forth to the hotel be cheap but the nightly trip to old san juan be $ 20.00 one way .<ssssss>no way you can play golf without rent a car .<ssssss>the golf course be located at least 45 min to a hour away .<ssssss>we eat at the hotel restaurant one nite .<ssssss>the 787 prime serve the best chateaubriand that i ever have .<ssssss>everyone else enjoy they food tremendously .<ssssss>the hotel have 2 tennis court right next to the pool .<ssssss>there be a large casino located next to the lobby .<ssssss>the casino house a nice large screen so i could enjoy my heel whip duke .<ssssss>they seem to have a band playing in the hotel lobby bar every night .<ssssss>the pool be large yet look old .<ssssss>they need to power wash the tile in the pool and exterior facade of hotel .<ssssss>the service by the pool and on the beach be excellent .<ssssss>the towel hut offer complimentary orange and apple every day .<ssssss>one exceptionally nice amenity for the hotel be the free use of the hobie cat/catamran sailboat .<ssssss>the banana boat be only $ 15 too .<ssssss>
1 2 1 -1 3 -1 1 -1		not worth the price i have book for 2 room and when i arrive , the room be on different floor .<ssssss>i expect for interconnect room or at least 2 room not too far one from the other .<ssssss>i ask for a change and they can find I 2 room separate by 2 other room .<ssssss>this hotel be very close to lax airport and have a shuttle to the airport every 10 mn .<ssssss>the room be clean but not well maintain .<ssssss>in the bathroom , you can not close the drain of the sink .<ssssss>in the tub , you can not have full water for the shower .<ssssss>half be lose in the tub .<ssssss>some lamp be not work because they be unplugged .<ssssss>and this hotel charge double than the other other in the lax airport area .<ssssss>not worth it .<ssssss>

4 4 3 2 3 5 5 3		unbelievable service i have never receive service like i receive at the elegante during my four night stay .<ssssss>the staff bent over backwards to ensure that i have everything that i need .<ssssss>we be in the lobby on we way to dinner and be try to figure out how to get to the restaurant .<ssssss>a employee see we struggle with direction and take we to the computer where he print out the route .<ssssss>he advise we of construction and give a way to avoid it .<ssssss>i notice that he be not dress like the rest of the staff and ask what he do at the hotel ... he be one of the maintenance worker .<ssssss>i stay at the omnus two week before and could not get anyone at the front desk to help.the mcm be a average hotel , clean , quiet with nice room .<ssssss>the area be a bit concern , but i would definitely stay at the hotel again , for the staff alone .<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 3 4 3 2		good value hotel just back from 3 night at the pelangus .<ssssss>get a good deal on a superior double with breakfast .<ssssss>meet at the airport by friendly driver , smooth easy check in , welcome drink , cold refreshing towel , friendly smiley service in general.rooms be ok , good size , comfortable bed , everything worked.bathroom could have be a little nicer .<ssssss>eventho be clean .<ssssss>.<ssssss>a little mould here and there , give it a very slight grotty feeling .<ssssss>but hey , for the price and for the amount of time that you actually be go to be in you hotel room in balus , it be fine .<ssssss>i think it could be a really great hotel if they spend a little more time and effort upkeep it .<ssssss>the grounds and garden be generally nice enough.breakfast be disappointing , presentation and variety be sadly lack .<ssssss>staff a little lackadaisical tho polite .<ssssss>nice view of the surf tho .<ssssss>pool look almost as good as in the photo on the website .<ssssss>have a lovely evening swim under the star which be great.if you want a 5 star luxurious stay , this aint it .<ssssss>there be heap of villa for rent that will do the trick but the pelangi be good value for money , comfortable and be pretty well situate .<ssssss>get a flight into balus be difficult , with most of they sell out .<ssssss>we flight be pack ... but once out and about in seminyak - it feel a little dead ... heap of great restaurant , shop and bar but all empty .<ssssss>

4 3 5 5 5 3 3 4		great hotel , avoid exec club we stay at this hotel a few year ago when it first open .<ssssss>at that time i assume the service problem on the executive club floor be only the growing pain of a brand new hotel .<ssssss>apparently not ... year later , the service on the exec floor be slow and inefficient .<ssssss>during cocktail hour , i have never see so many waiter do so little so slowly.at breakfast time the number of table available be completely and utterly insufficient for the number of people who want to eat !<ssssss>the hotel should either add more table or allow club member to use room service as a complimentary alternative.having criticize the club floor to bit , i would now like to state that the rest of the hotel be gorgeous .<ssssss>the room be large -lrb- by hk standard -rrb- with lot of storage , cushy bed , wifus , massive tv , minibar , kettle , great bathroom with seperate tub and shower stall , and wonderful floor to ceiling window .<ssssss>the pool have a wonderful view ... i assume you be not go to hk to tan , but if you be , be advise the sun go behind adjacent building after 2 pm.check-in can be dicey : we be keep wait for we room from 4 pm to 6:30 pm upon arrival ... give we use the hotel car and thus the hotel know when we be arrive it be a puzzle how they could get it so wrong .<ssssss>i find the best rate for this hotel on the hotel website .<ssssss>when we stay here again we will book a room only ... the executive club be not worth the extra $ $ give the inconvenience , slow service and inadequate facility .<ssssss>

3 4 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		better than most but nothing to write home about !<ssssss>wow the hotel must be pretty poor at lax for this to have receive so much acclaim .<ssssss>generally i find the service poor especially at restaurant -lrb- s -rrb- .<ssssss>we end up just leave the resturant to go to the bar area and then leave that to go upstairs to order room service .<ssssss>yes the hotel be clean and comfortable but it be still just a airport hotel .<ssssss>not in we mind be worthy of anything but above average for airport hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 2 1 3 4 3 -1		this be not a five star resort this be we second visit to punta cana .<ssssss>we be very satisfied with the resort we select last year however we choose a different , similarly rate resort this year .<ssssss>we be disappointed.first of all , the resort be a good 75 to 90 minute from the airport - the 45/60 minute they tell you in brochure be not true , owe to how bad the road be , and the bus will make one or 2 stop at other resort drop passenger .<ssssss>the resortâ€™s website say 30 minute !<ssssss>â€?at least one would reasonably expect to see a real gem off the beaten path .<ssssss>the reception be very good â€?the bellman offer we a glass of champagne and a cold cloth to refresh ourselves , and the resort do not require we to wear a bracelet.when we get to we room , there be a very strong musty odour â€?like if door have not be open and room have be unoccupied for a long time .<ssssss>we complain to the front desk but all they do be burn a long match to change the scent .<ssssss>room be poorly light , make it difficult to read at night .<ssssss>the mattress be average at best with no box spring underneath .<ssssss>there be no security lock on we door .<ssssss>while there be a deadbolt above the door handle , it open when we insert we regular key or when housekeeping or mini-bar staff insert theirs .<ssssss>the only privacy we could get be place a do not disturb sign outside the door .<ssssss>housekeeping be also average at best â€?they would come in at different time each day and each day we have to call front desk for washcloth and hand towels.the main eating area for breakfast and lunch -lrb- the tuscana restaurant -rrb- be without air conditioning for the first 3 day we be there .<ssssss>we wonder what take so long to fix it â€?the same length of time it take to fix a urinal adjacent to the restaurant.overall we find food be generally bland .<ssssss>choice be otherwise ok -lrb- mostly -rrb- .<ssssss>when we go to the french restaurant , they do not have the appetizer and entree i want -lrb- escargot and venison -rrb- .<ssssss>we check again 3 day later and it be the same answer â€?new menu , not everything be in yet .<ssssss>they should not put it on the menu if they donâ€™t have it .<ssssss>on another occasion we go to the lobsterhouse restaurant .<ssssss>lobster be they specialty but the steamer be not work that night .<ssssss>we leave and come back the follow night .<ssssss>the steamer be fix but lobster be not as appetizing as what we be accustomed to.the pool be very nice and the bar provide very good choice and service .<ssssss>we do not find the beach very nice .<ssssss>there be quite a elevation between the water and the beach chair , and the sand harbour mosquito .<ssssss>my wife be bite badly from the calf down , although i hardly get bit myself .<ssssss>we have not experienced mosquito at the other resort we visit last year.finally , not a big deal but the resortâ€™s website also do not tell you its casino be close for renovation , although we do not see any renovation take place the week we be there .<ssssss>if you like to gamble , you will have to take a shuttle to the nearest hotel â€?about 5 minutes.to sum up , we do not consider the excellence a five star resort , although it be price as such .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1		worst experience ever !<ssssss>please do not stay at this hotel .<ssssss>i can not believe they be still in business .<ssssss>i check in on sunday night on thanksgiving week .<ssssss>15 min later i want my car so that i can park outside of the hotel since they parking fee be $ 35 a night .<ssssss>when i get my car back , my car be damage .<ssssss>they tell I to fill out they accident report and tell I someone will call I back .<ssssss>next day no one call I so i complaint at front desk .<ssssss>they tell I that be none of they business , as parking be outsource to different company .<ssssss>until today 2 week after thanksgive , i still not have receive any call from they .<ssssss>i might have to fix the car myself out of my insurance .<ssssss>very unprofessional and they do not care about customer at all .<ssssss>
2 4 2 4 2 3 2 3		not the best in this category harbour plaza metropolis be quite well located in hong hom at walk distance from tst .<ssssss>some room have great view on the harbour and the fantastic building of central and causeway bay but the hotel be , in general , not really good .<ssssss>if the lobby be clear and huge and give a good opinion about the hotel , the room be not very large and the bathroom be terribly small just with a shower .<ssssss>we book for a superior one bedroom suite but we arrive at the hotel early in the morning and i think the hotel staff tell we this category be not available for a early check in just to sell a higher category .<ssssss>consequently and even if i be pretty sure a superior one bedroom suite be available , i have accept to buy a upgrade because we be too tired to wait 5 hour .<ssssss>it cost 70 euro per night to be allocate in a grand deluxe harbour view suite ... it be one of the best category in this hotel and that be true , the view be good but there be nothing special in more except the huge space for the living room .<ssssss>consequently , the atmosphere in the suite be too cold and it be not really clean -lrb- dirty sofa , chair cover ... -rrb- .<ssssss>the soundproofing be not excellent and the curtain be not well fix and you will be wake up at the first morning light ... it be not very comfortable ... about the staff , some be really smily and nice , some other one be not good at all but it be ok .<ssssss>the buffet breakfast be interesting with a large selection of european and asian delight but the decoration of the restaurant be simply ugly ... in conclusion , i think this hotel be very affordable but there be other hotel much better in this category ...<ssssss>
4 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		very good this be we first big holiday together and we be a little nervous after read some of the bad review .<ssssss>no offence but we find most of the bad review be by american who maybe have a better hotel standard that british people , thing such as ice tray do not really concern we but it seem to be a big thing with american ... we book a standard room and when we get there i cheekily ask for a free upgrade and be tell it be $ 60 a night for a partial ocean view , we decline and he say he would try and get we a good standard room .<ssssss>when we get in we room the balcony be at the side of the hotel but at the end of the block so we get a good view of the beach from there , we be very pleased with that !<ssssss>the sand outside the beach be quite harsh , nice , but definately not soft !<ssssss>and the water be about 3 foot deep for about half a mile out , all dead coral and rock , we go in and be very dissapointed and come out with a couple of cut ... .<ssssss>i be lead to believe that be you walk a half mile to you left or right the water be a lot nicer as they have dig up all the rock .<ssssss>it really be not worth go for a swim immediately outside the hotel , although it be good for paddle and the kid to play in for a good 5 or 6 meter befor it get rocky.the hotel have a good selection of shop , all reasonably price , although if you walk into town and go in a abc store -lrb- they be everywhere -rrb- you will find a better and cheaper selection of everthe you could ever want!the restaurant in the hotel be ok .<ssssss>i say that becuase of the follow , the shorebird have a great breakfast !!!!<ssssss>nice enough lunch , but it be the evening meal we struggle with .<ssssss>you buy a piece of meat and cook it yourself on these big grill thing ... it be fun and the meat be the best i have ever taste , but after a long day we do not want to cook we own meal ... .<ssssss>and the heat from the grill be eyewateringly hot !<ssssss>not a pleasant experience when the wind blow you way !<ssssss>also no real butter , only cream butter which sound nice but do not taste that nice!the restaurant next door , cant remember ther name , we go there once and do not think much of it , quite expensive and everything be serve with mash potato , not a place for child at all !!!<ssssss>the food be for older people who want a nice meal in a nice restaurant but something that do not taste brilliant , do not go back!we do not fancy the place near the pool , look a bit dirty ... drink from there be nice tho !<ssssss>and quick service ... all in all a great holiday !<ssssss>recommend go to the big island volcano tour !!!!<ssssss>big recommendation !!!<ssssss>- do not take any t-shirt !!<ssssss>you can buy about 5 of they for 10 and very nice quality !<ssssss>aso cheap shorts and everything !<ssssss>towel very cheap also !!<ssssss>email I if you want any info gemmaadair@blueyonder.co.uk<ssssss>

3 4 1 5 3 4 2 3		convenient , but somewhat lack the westin st. francis have a location that be hard to beat - right on union square .<ssssss>you be close to a lot of restaurant and to bart .<ssssss>we be there for a conference , so we have a really cheap conference rate , but we be in one of the really tiny room in the old part of the hotel .<ssssss>since we be pay so little , i do not think that we can really complain , but space be tight for 2 people .<ssssss>if you can afford a nicer room , either here or at another hotel , i would go for it .<ssssss>that say , i feel that we experience be not nearly as good as we experience in other westin hotel .<ssssss>we have a major problem with room service breakfast the first day .<ssssss>my husband have to get out early to make a meeting , and we put the door hanger order on the door the night before , only to have breakfast deliver 45 minute late .<ssssss>i call after 15 minute , as he be really on a tight schedule , and they say it will be there in 10 minute , but it come 30 minute later instead .<ssssss>as a result , he do not really have time to eat much of it before he leave .<ssssss>this be not the end of the world this particular trip , but there have be time when this would have be a serious problem .<ssssss>in addition , the egg be barely , barely cook , and everything be cold when it arrive .<ssssss>that be pretty underwhelming .<ssssss>the wall be super thin - we be wake up by we neighbor 's tv every morning , which also be not that great .<ssssss>we neighbor do not seem to be make a unusual amount of noise , but we could hear it all .<ssssss>i use the gym while i be there .<ssssss>it be $ 12/day , which i thought be a pretty bad deal .<ssssss>i guess we room be so cheap that it all even out , but honestly , i would expect free access to a fitness center in a major hotel like this , unless the fitness center be part of a bigger , luxe sport club , which this one be not .<ssssss>it be just a regular hotel fitness center .<ssssss>i could not really do weight because there be not enough to go around , just one set of dumbbell , and the one i want be in use .<ssssss>there be about 5 or 6 treadmill , a couple of stairmaster , and maybe 4 elliptical machine .<ssssss>there be also weight machine ; i guess people be suppose to use these instead of dumbbell ?<ssssss>the equipment itself be fine , but space be cramped -lrb- like everything else in the hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>you do get a free bottle of water , but i do not know that , so i bring my own .<ssssss>all in all , if you do not mind the small room -lrb- which i absolutely would not do with more than 2 people , so if you have kid , forget it -rrb- for a good price -lrb- we conference rate be so good that i bet even the regular rate be a good deal for union square -rrb- , and want to be in the middle of it all , i guess i would stay here , but if/when we return to sf , we will probably pick a different hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 1 3 3 3 4 1		nice service in a very date , run-down hotel staff a the hotel be extremely considerate and careful , even by japanese stadard .<ssssss>it be therefore rather diificult to understand how the hotel management have let the 20th century pass by without update the property .<ssssss>room decor and furnishings be from the 1940 , and be probably not even second-class quality when they be new .<ssssss>the japanese restaurant be top quality but not very welcome to westerner arrive on they own -lrb- i happen to be a woman travel alone on business , and generally get reaction of horrified panic when i try to enter -- even though my japanese be pretty darn good -rrb- .<ssssss>i find the western food , in contrast to other reviewer here , absolutely revolting .<ssssss>it be that 1960s japanese interpretation of western food which feature weird combination -lrb- hot dog on sugar bread ; everything cover with mayonnaise , spaghetti with tomoato sauce top with seaweed shaving , etc etc -rrb- .<ssssss>the gym have literally not be renovate since 1962 -- i ask .<ssssss>yes , the garden be lovely ... why not stop and check it out on you way to a nicer hotel ?<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 4 3 1 3		chancellor blow the chance to impress !!<ssssss>this hotel definitely cater to those who donâ€™t care about they accommodation but simply need a place to drop off they luggage .<ssssss>the great location and quaint motif be sadly offset by the paper thin wall surround a sardine-small room and a lack of customer service .<ssssss>my wife and i decide to go to san francisco for we five year anniversary .<ssssss>on we first night we be unable to sleep due to the rice paper thin wall .<ssssss>we be able to hear the neighborsâ€?television and the detail of they conversation .<ssssss>a majority of the staff do not speak english but when youâ€™re lucky to find someone who do they have no desire to help you .<ssssss>i ask for information and assistance to book a show .<ssssss>they simply give I a couple of number and tell I to help myself .<ssssss>on we second night my wife wake up at around midnight parch from the hustle and bustle of the day .<ssssss>i call the front desk to purchasesome bottled water .<ssssss>to my dismay they tell I they donâ€™t offer that since they donâ€™t have room service .<ssssss>the restaurant and convenience store be both close .<ssssss>i ask if there be a vend machine nearbyand they reply that there be none on the premise .<ssssss>they direct I to go to a drugstore and begrudgingly i go in the middle of the night in my pajamas and a jacket i regret do so immediately when i be accost by a vagrant ask for ask for money .<ssssss>he be relentless and wouldnâ€™t leave I alone .<ssssss>needless to say this will be we last stay at chancellor hotel on union square .<ssssss>

3 4 2 2 5 3 2 -1		good value for tourist we win a night 's stay at the city inn -lrb- with a theatre trip throw in -rrb- and think we have sample a london hotel - even though we live very close to the property!it offer very good value for the tourist - who populate the hotel - and a first class breakfast buffet with the freshest ingredient constantly replenish .<ssssss>the service leave something to be desire however with the welcome perfunctory again and the breakfast waitress clearly want to be somewhere else .<ssssss>room be small , well design , basic , clean and completely devoid of character .<ssssss>the bed be appalling ; mattress far too soft for a good night 's sleep but at least the room be quiet .<ssssss>nice flat screen tv/dvd etc though.for the experienced london visitor , the location be terrible.getting home after theatre be difficult and novice could be put off by this .<ssssss>however if you be a art lover , the tate britain be within spit distance so that could not be better.great if you be on a budget , but do not feel like the real london at all .<ssssss>
4 3 2 3 2 5 5 -1		old run down hotel .<ssssss>not value for money .<ssssss>stay at the park hotel for four night .<ssssss>book a run of the house type of room .<ssssss>the room i stay in be not the modern lovely look room feature at the website .<ssssss>my room be rather old and badly need a revamp .<ssssss>the room definitely do not feel 4star at all.location be not as fanastic as i expect from the other review i read before my trip .<ssssss>to get to leidseplein , its a good 10min walk .<ssssss>form leidseplein if you want to go to the dam , its another 20min walk .<ssssss>tram stop -lrb- no 1,2,5 -rrb- also do not stop very near the hotel .<ssssss>the tram stop be about 3block away .<ssssss>but if you be intend to buy luxury goods , the hotel be very near to the pc hooftstraat .<ssssss>however , i have to compliment the friendly and polite staff who be always ready to help with a smile .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 4 2 2		nice hotel ... not a place for people with disability !!<ssssss>hello ... my friend and i stay at this resort for one week -lrb- woman age 26 and 42 -rrb- .<ssssss>when we arrive we be give a room with one bed but have reserve a room with two double bed ... it take quite abit of talk to get a double room .<ssssss>my friend be recover from a car accident and be not able to walk the stair or great distance .<ssssss>this hotel have no elevator even though it be three story .<ssssss>no availibiltiy of a wheel chair for use ... but they do have ramp beside the major building .<ssssss>.<ssssss>there be alot of walk need to get from point a to b but you can catch a mini bus if you wait long enough .<ssssss>there be not alot of food for the vegetarian as most dish be meat/fish base .<ssssss>most time i could not find someone in the dinning room who speak enough english to tell I if the dish i be interested in have meat or fish .<ssssss>.<ssssss>beware of the lack of label for the person with allergy .<ssssss>the pillow be absolutely terrible !!!!!!!!<ssssss>i think they use the old towel to make pillow as they be so lumpy .<ssssss>this be a difficult resort to go to if you only speak english .<ssssss>if you a single woman ... well thats another story !!<ssssss>... the staff that work by the pool flirt and proposition you so much you be ready to scream by day 3 .<ssssss>but overall my stay be nice ... could have do without the all firt to have some peace .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 2 2 2 2		will not stay here again this be we second stay at the westin time square , this time for four day and i leave disappointed and resolute that i will not stay at this hotel again.the hotel be aware that we stay be a special birthday celebration .<ssssss>the staff make absolutely no acknowledgement of the this unlike other hotel who make a point of personally acknowledge occasion , often unprompted.as this be a special occasion i have email the hotel to request a room on a high floor .<ssssss>we arrive at 10pm and we bag be take from the car without ask - we be tell they would be deliver to we room .<ssssss>at check in the staff appear uninterested and assign we a room on the 14th floor .<ssssss>we corner room be a reasonable size and shape however on arrival we have no washcloth , no shower gel , no bathrobe and the office chair be dirty - someone have obviously spill food on it which have not be adequately clean .<ssssss>the bathroom surface be also mark with shower gel rings/spills etc and there be a layer of dust on the hairdryer and strange little stainless steel trolley which it stand on .<ssssss>overall there have be no attention to detail from the housekeeping staff.the in room dining menu be no longer a print document but be supposedly available through a menu on the tv which do not work.after 30 minute attempt to view the in room dining menu and order via a defective television , we give up and call the service team and place we order.an hour after we have arrive we bag have still not appear .<ssssss>they eventually appear a few minute before we food order!on each day we be awaken very early in the morning by either door slam in the corridor , we neighbour play the tv or the housekeeping staff bang door up and down the corridor , include ours which have a do not disturb sign on it .<ssssss>the wall seem to be make of paper !<ssssss>there be no turn down service on any of the evening .<ssssss>there be no wireless internet which be surprising in a 4 star supposedly business class hotel .<ssssss>the fast ethernet connection cable be chargeable at a rate of $ 15 per 24 hour period which be rather poor.unlike some of the reviewer who be fortunate enough to have poor service at a reasonable price of around $ 200 i pay almost double this so you can see why i be rather disgusted and will not be stay here again.on a positive note - shula 's the in house restaurant serve we the best steak we have ever eat and the wait staff be very efficient and polite .<ssssss>
3 3 5 5 4 5 2 -1		i expect better service ... ... but do not get it .<ssssss>we be with a extremely large group of traveler so perhaps the staff be overwhelm ?<ssssss>my biggest complaint : - it take several call and many hour to get the refrigerator we have request in advance -lrb- it come at 1 be -rrb- .<ssssss>- housekeeping really short we on towel and toiletries and ignore we repeat request to change the sheet .<ssssss>- two different concierge be very condescending to I - even though i do my internet research and know what i be talk about .<ssssss>- the valet service , which be really slow btw , be at time so rude to we !<ssssss>perhaps because we rental be a ford minivan and not a bmw or lexus .<ssssss>the noise from the construction site do not really bother I , but i certainly understand how it would disturb other and it do intrude on my peaceful lanai reading time .<ssssss>it look like that building will be go up for a long while , fyi.other than these problem , the room be very comfortable and the hotel decor be great .<ssssss>the location be fabulous , give the close proximity to beverly hill and the freeway .<ssssss>also it be across the street from the fabulous century city westfield mall , which have a really nice food court and great shop .<ssssss>overall i enjoy we stay , i just wish we have be treat a little better .<ssssss>

4 4 4 3 3 3 4 1		value for money i spend 1 week in melia balus in march 2006 and have mix feeling about the trip .<ssssss>of course , 70 usd per room be a very good price but there be several thing to remember :1 .<ssssss>the hotel be located in the forest , so you be back to back with nature .<ssssss>the view be amazing , but this result in very wet condition everywhere .<ssssss>and there be nothing anyone can do about it .<ssssss>neither the conditioner nor the staff can help .<ssssss>you just have to know that wet clothes will never be dry again ; that paper will be also kinda wet .<ssssss>as for I it be no problem , it be like live in a jungle wood .2 .<ssssss>the sea in nusa dua be very quiet .<ssssss>it be not good for diving etc. it be also a shallow and you should not forget about ebb and flow .<ssssss>for we it be no problem since we use to swim close to the rock -lrb- 150 + metre from the beachline -rrb- with big wave .3 .<ssssss>staff be great .<ssssss>they will bring back the moon by you request .4 .<ssssss>food be also nice but of course overprice as compare to the city .5 .<ssssss>rent-a-car be good , you can explore the island which be very big for several day and pay 25usd per day .6 .<ssssss>no lan in the room , however good set of tv channel .<ssssss>internet be available in the business centre -lrb- but expensive like in most of asian underdeveloped country -rrb- .<ssssss>to conclude : good and very well price but not for everyone .<ssssss>

2 2 1 4 2 3 3 4		1 star at best location be great but room leave alot to be desire .<ssssss>i be not sure if it be because we arrive at 8 o'clock and it be the last room available -lrb- even think we pre-pay in may -rrb- but it be not what we expect .<ssssss>the room be very dark and the bathroom be a obvious converted closet with a folding door .<ssssss>the first morning we make - shift shower back up and there be water cover the entire bathroom floor .<ssssss>there be no other room available so we be stick with that room for the next 3 night .<ssssss>the owner of the hotel fix the shower problem but after that first morning it leave a bad taste in we mouth .<ssssss>the free internet be nice and the breakfast be good but i dont think we room be worthy of 2 star .<ssssss>will not return<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 5 5 4 -1		valley wing package very disappointing .<ssssss>we agent recommend the shangri la for the two night we would be in singapore follow we cruise .<ssssss>we pay for the valley wing which be the more exclusive accommodation and be tell the price cover breakfast , afternoon tea , canape and drink in the evening .<ssssss>we have stay at the shangri la hotel in hong kong and be very impressed with the wonderful hot nibble that be offer on the buffet .<ssssss>we be not big drinker but we do enjoy have the evening canape that be freely on offer .<ssssss>however we soon discover that the sl in singapore be quite a different proposition .<ssssss>the breakfast be fine , no complaint there and we be never in the hotel during the afternoon tea hour .<ssssss>however when we arrive home from shopping and touring and go down to enjoy the canape , we be suprise to be give merely one plate each with three very small and mostly cold offering .<ssssss>no buffet as we have be expect and a very stingy offering .<ssssss>certainly it be nice to have the two glass of wine we enjoy but as far as the canape go , that be it for the evening .<ssssss>after that we be tell there be cookie available .<ssssss>not very enjoyable with a glass of wine ... apart from that , we room be certainly large with a nice aspect but the bed be very very firm .<ssssss>both my husband and i end up have to take medication for we sore back .<ssssss>we order room service one evening but the food be very ordinary and not worth the money .<ssssss>we eat a hundred time better at one of the food mall on orchard road .<ssssss>so , despite pay the extra for a valley wing room it be very disappointing and not worth the money .<ssssss>would not stay at the sl in singapore again .<ssssss>

5 4 4 5 5 3 5 2		very enjoyable stay i be stay in florence for three night in march 2007 , and have a very pleasant stay here .<ssssss>this be a good quality modern 3 * tourist hotel , that avoid the soulless nature of chain hotel .<ssssss>the biggest plus point would be :1 -rrb- location .<ssssss>it be between the main train station -lrb- 10 minute walk -rrb- and the duomo -lrb- 50 yard away -rrb- and it make it easy to access all the major florence site by foot .2 -rrb- staff .<ssssss>the hotel be run by a australian woman and she italian husband -lrb- a architect who be in charge of the 2006 refurbishment -rrb- who be both very friendly and helpful -lrb- as be the rest of they staff -rrb- .<ssssss>i be able to enjoy a very pleasant chat with the proprietor over a couple of glass of good italian red !<ssssss>for those -lrb- like I -rrb- whose italian be not what it could be , it be helpful to have english speaking hotel staff to give you advice .3 -rrb- room quality .<ssssss>the hotel be refurbish at the start of 2006 , so you get modern fixture and fitting -lrb- flat screen tv , good air-conditioning/heating , good shower , comfortable bed etc -rrb- .<ssssss>this be a chintz free zone -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>of course if you like flowery bespread or faux-antique style room then by all means stay somewhere else ... many other thing also add-up to a enjoyable stay .<ssssss>good buffet breakfast , free internet access in the lobby -lrb- and i believe the room , although i do not have a laptop with I -rrb- , room and corridor keep clean and tidy etc.to be clear , this be very definitely a tourist hotel , and be not try to be anything else .<ssssss>so do not come here on business expect a restaurant / conference facility / mini-bar etc. but if -lrb- like I -rrb- you just want somewhere to sleep and eat breakfast before a long day of sightseeing then i think you would find it hard to beat in this price range.my -lrb- minor -rrb- quibble would be :1 -rrb- my room be near the stairwell , and it could be a little noisy when people be come back late at night .2 -rrb- the street entrance be not the most appealing -lrb- the hotel occupy the upper floor of a larger building , with the lobby on the 3rd floor -rrb- but that be be petty , and overall i be very pleased with this hotel and would recommend it to other traveller on a moderate budget .<ssssss>

-rrb-<ssssss>, but it be actually ready very quickly -lrb- after about 15 minute -rrb- so it be no problem at all .<ssssss>we have the most basic type of room , but it be still gorgeous .<ssssss>a canopy bed , a beautiful little terrace outside where you can sit and read while over-look the jungle , and a wonderful bathroom with a tub and a separate open-air shower .<ssssss>the water pressure be strong and hot , which i really appreciate and the towel be big and fluffy .<ssssss>every morning the hotel make up the room , and again at night , there be another clean-up and turn-down service .<ssssss>my one complaint about the room be that the sheet on we bed be quite stain in a few place .<ssssss>it be clear that they have be wash -lrb- so it be sanitary -rrb- but clearly some previous stain have be hard to remove and be still very visible .<ssssss>i do not know whether this be just we experience or whether other guest find this , too .<ssssss>other than this , though , everything else about the room and the hotel be perfect .<ssssss>location-wise , the uma be not directly in the center of ubud , but i rather like this because the main part of ubud feel a lot more crowded and noisy , and i appreciate be in a little bit quieter of a area while still have easy access to ubud .<ssssss>there be a free shuttle every few hour from the hotel into town , and if the schedule do not fit you need , they will always drive you in at another time for a slight charge .<ssssss>also , it be a pleasant walk into town -lrb- about 20-25 minute -rrb- .<ssssss>go there be downhill , but come back be uphill , so we get a ride back rather than walk .<ssssss>right in the vicinity of the uma be several delicious restaurant that be worth a visit .<ssssss>naughty nuri 's be directly across the street and be a popular but inexpensive choice where you can have indonesian food , bar-b-que , and famous martini .<ssssss>local and tourist , alike , go there , so you will definitely get a feel for the local -lrb- or at least the ex-pat -rrb- community .<ssssss>about a 5 minute walk from the uma be the restaurant indus which be delicious -lrb- we go there 3 time over we 6 day in ubud ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>there be a lot of variety on the menu , a beautiful view overlook the valley , and great price .<ssssss>for example , we have dinner with a appetizer , two entree , two cocktail , and dessert , and include tax and service charge the total be about $ 35 we .<ssssss>a great price !<ssssss>the other famous restaurant in the neighborhood of the uma be mozaic , which be a bit more on the pricey side but be a amazing , luxurious , and delicious dining experience .<ssssss>you sit in the garden atmosphere and dine on a 6-course tasting menu -lrb- they will cater the course to vegetarian need or other preferenece , too ! -rrb-<ssssss>if you want to get a massage or other spa treatment right near the uma , there be bali botanica day spa , which i highly recommend .<ssssss>very relaxing , comfortable , and a great deal.but back to the uma , itself !<ssssss>it be the kind of hotel where you could easily spend all day there relax by the beautiful pool , take one of the complimentary guide walk through the rice paddy , work out at the gym , take a free yoga class , or check out a dvd from the front desk to watch in you room on a rainy day .<ssssss>the yoga pavillion be the most gorgeous place you can ever do yoga -- even if you do not normally do it , it be worth a try just for the setting -lrb- it overlook the lush river valley -rrb- .<ssssss>there be also a business center with several computer , and i believe the hotel have free wireless internet if you bring you own laptop -lrb- which we do not -rrb- .<ssssss>there be just so much there that whether we be tour around ubud or just hang around the hotel we be never bore and it be relax at the same time .<ssssss>the food at uma be also delicious .<ssssss>there be healthier option , too , on both the breakfast and lunch/dinner menu .<ssssss>breakfast , which be include , have many choice and come with amazing fruit juice smoothie -lrb- we favorite be the coconut , mango , papaya juice -- try it ! -rrb-<ssssss>perhaps what stand out most at the uma be the hotel staff .<ssssss>they be so friendly , calm , responsive , and helpful with anything you might need either around the hotel or in the area .<ssssss>whether we have question about restaurant , attend a dance performance in the area , or get to/from the airport , they be always there to help and make arrangement .<ssssss>on the first night we be there , they even send a complimentary bottle of champagne to we room since they know it be we honeymoon .<ssssss>that be such a sweet touch and we really appreciate it .<ssssss>we see a range of guest there , from young couple like we to family with young child to older visitor .<ssssss>we absolutely love the uma and would recommend it to anyone !<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 5 5 5 2		would not have find this if not for trip advisor .<ssssss>this be we final stop on a 4 night road trip .<ssssss>we request 2 double bed per room with connect room and that be exactly what we get .<ssssss>the sheraton be a older building but very well keep and very clean .<ssssss>the only negative would be that you can hear people in the hallway and other room , but it really be not too noisy.all of the staff that we come across be friendly and helpful , give we very good instruction to the place we want to see as well as correct the location for the rental car that we need to drop off .<ssssss>a ride to the airport be easily and efficiently arranged.this be a very pleasant stay and we would happily stay here again .<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 5 4 4 5		a strange neighborhood the hilton garden inn be located on a side street of canal street .<ssssss>though this be very close to the french quarter itself , the somewhat sketchy walk through these side street make I wary of stay there alone .<ssssss>beside its location , the hotel and its staff be wonderful .<ssssss>there be a tendency for loud yell at 3am in the morning as college-age student return from they shenanigan on burbon street .<ssssss>i would recommend this hotel if you have someone to stay and walk with and if you can get a special deal that include free parking -lrb- it be a 26 dollar fee otherwise -rrb- .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 5 4 3		pro just back after spend 4 night at the bellevue - book -lrb- as ususal -rrb- on the back of tripadvisor reviews.pros : great location - 3 minute from central station .<ssssss>clean - room be spotless .<ssssss>very pleasant staff at reception .<ssssss>comfortable bed.generally speak , what more could you ask for ?<ssssss>but ... con : no coffeee/tea facility .<ssssss>no mini-bar/fridge .<ssssss>no iron facility .<ssssss>no ice machine on premises.also : one inch gap along bottom of room door mean both noise from other guest and light from hall come into room - end up wedge coat into the gap in a attempt to keep out both .<ssssss>room at front can be alittle noisy as hotel be situate at a busy junction.the room be a little cramped and definitely strangely lay out but it be amsterdam after all .<ssssss>overall i would have to say that i have stay in worse but at around Â£110 per night for a standard double i would have expect a little more - even real glass in the bathroom would have be nice rather than the cheap disposable one which go unchanged by room service for the entire length of we stay.sl n. ireland<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 2 5 3 4		lost appeal ... my wife and i return for we 3rd visit in four year .<ssssss>we do not visit resort last year .<ssssss>the resort have definitely lose its appeal since we last visit .<ssssss>the beach remain the highlite of the resort .<ssssss>the riu melao have merge into the taino , cause staffing and cleanup problem around the pool area .<ssssss>the pool bar need paint -- badly !<ssssss>we choose not to swim near the bar !<ssssss>the resort have become overcrowded .<ssssss>of course , guest be unwilling to clean up the mess leave behind .<ssssss>sad !<ssssss>the food in the main restaurant have become boring and predictable .<ssssss>little or no taste .<ssssss>they no longer have seat time .<ssssss>which create a cattle callat 7pm .<ssssss>shorts be now permit to be wear at dinner as well .<ssssss>fortunately , 95 % of the guest come to dinner presentable .<ssssss>we miss the dressy dinner atmosphere and have we regular table and waiter , carlo .<ssssss>a few of the staff who stand out over the year be still there .<ssssss>we will miss they professionalism and kindness.needless to say , this be we third visit -- and we last<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 3 1 1 -1		it be what it be ... .<ssssss>sunrise at parador villa del mar<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 4 3 1		poor value i stay at this hotel as the last 2 night of a 5 night trip after move across from the royal plaza on scotts.the room at the pan pacific be very spacious with good view .<ssssss>that be the only good thing i have to say about this hotel .<ssssss>the furnishings be very date , especially the bathroom .<ssssss>for a 5 star hotel i expect the room to be renovate semi regluarly not every 20 year .<ssssss>the cost to use the internet -lrb- if you do not have you own lap top -rrb- be very high .<ssssss>the bar in the lobby charge astronomical prices.if you be look for value then i could not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>of the two hotel i stay at the royal plaza be far better value even if there be no view and the room be smaller , i would still go back there .<ssssss>
2 3 2 1 4 3 1 -1		what a big disappointment the hotel staff be less than accommodate .<ssssss>the room be ok but the bed be hard as a rock .<ssssss>the food be good but the wait staff be slow and less than cooperative .<ssssss>the mexican restaurant agave be a waste of time and you have to wait for dinner every night and they would not take reservations.a friend of ours slip on the step -lrb- no sign to show the step down -rrb- have to be rush to the clinic and all the resort be concern about be that they do not sue they .<ssssss>they do not do anything to help we friend -lrb- no offer to pay the room or get they a special room -rrb- .<ssssss>they be definitely a bad attitude with the service staff.i will never go there again and neither will any of we friend .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 5 4 4 3		good bargain , great locale i agree with the other review , small but comfortable room , pleasant staff , awesome location .<ssssss>i be just go to add some tip : the breakfast at the hotel be quite pricey .<ssssss>there be a nice affordable coffee shop across the street where you can get coffee or tea and pastry and sandwich -lrb- cafe veloce -rrb- .<ssssss>we eat there every morning and enjoy we time among the folk - people watch .<ssssss>also , you can bill the hotel restaurant meal to you room if you ask .<ssssss>the reason this be convenient be that we run out of cash and the hotel will not cash traveller 's check for you but the citibank in the tower next door -lrb- 19th floor -rrb- with do this for you .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		need update quickly i have read all of the review and i can not tell you how disappoiint the hotel be .<ssssss>they have not update this place in at least 20 year .<ssssss>okay , most of waikiki have not be update in 20 + year , but this hotel charge $ 400 - $ 500 per night .<ssssss>come on and at least put some money into the place .<ssssss>we check into on the suite in the historic building .<ssssss>it be quote at $ 1100 per night .<ssssss>as a starwood prefer guest member , i receive a better rate , but to my amazement , the room be something i could find at a comfort in .<ssssss>cheap furniture than be chip , peel and fall apart .<ssssss>stain furniture that be so outdated .<ssssss>the bathroom be also very tacky and old .<ssssss>the hotel reluctantly move we to the tower suite .<ssssss>the suite have a amazing view and be a 360 degree turn from the first suite , but the furniture in the tower suite be awful too .<ssssss>old , cheap and outdated .<ssssss>the location of the hotel be the best and the beach access be wonderful , but other than that , i would recommend anyone seek a first-class hotel to look for another location or rent a condo .<ssssss>
2 3 3 -1 2 -1 5 -1		maybe we be just unlucky ??!!<ssssss>ok , so maybe we be just unlucky when we stay here for 2 night over labor day weekend ??<ssssss>my husband and i be stay without the kiddie for the weekend , because we be head up to lahey clinic on tuesday and decide to have a couple night to ourselves .<ssssss>so , after read the review for jury and nine zero we pick jury .<ssssss>i guess i wish that we have try the nine zero.our first room be on the 10th floor , one of only 3 room , so it would be quiet , which be great .<ssssss>however , the bedspread and pillow have numerous stain on they , the toilet in the bathroom have the seat unattached , and the tv do not work right .<ssssss>the volume on the tv be cap , which be not a problem , but it be when one speaker out of two total speaker be not work .<ssssss>no problem , we call down to see if we could move , as we be plan on catch up on we movie via payperview while we be away.we be relocate to a room on the 5th floor .<ssssss>it be not noisy and be a pretty good size .<ssssss>the pro and con of the hotel be as follow : pro :1 -rrb- good location .2 -rrb- nice aveda product in the bathroom3 -rrb- fabulous dual head shower and towel warmer !!<ssssss>4 -rrb- nice and accomodate staff , really superb .5 -rrb- great breakfast room service , try the blueberry pancakes .6 -rrb- refridgerator in room that be empty so you can stock it.cons :1 -rrb- very expensive room service , as expect , but atrocious dinner food .2 -rrb- no store to buy snack or soda within close walk distance .3 -rrb- room not the cleanest ... dust on furniture , stain on carpets.all in all , not bad , but for $ 250 + a night , i would expect the hotel to be in a little better condition .<ssssss>little thing that be annoying be we only have one bathrobe , the warm cookie from room service be good , but not warm , parking be $ 36 a day , not easy in/out either - a good 15 to 20 minute wait each time .<ssssss>all the other review be very positive so maybe it be just we .<ssssss>however , this be what happen during we stay .<ssssss>i probably would not stay here again , would opt for the other hotel in the area .<ssssss>
1 3 -1 3 1 1 1 -1		nightmare in paradise warning - book this hotel at you own risk!i have read many review on this property and despite some warning on this site , we go with we family and friends.upon arrival to the hotel lobby , with confirmation in hand , we be tell that there be no room for we .<ssssss>the hotel be sell out.wow ... we fly 4500 mile and there be no room at the inn ... amazing since we group coordinator speak with the hotel the day before and all be confirmed.there be another couple from the state at the desk with we who have pay for there reservation 4 month ago and they be turn away as well ... right about that time a bus pull up from the airport only to have a clerk from the hotel desk go out and yell at the driver that he can not bring they here , there be no room .<ssssss>i have never see such a unorganized hotel .<ssssss>the lobby be full of unhappy people -lrb- about 50 -rrb- , yet just a few step away towards the beach , many be enjoy the pool and all the activity .<ssssss>then a honeymoon couple come up to the desk and be turn away ... i think that guy be go to get physical ... it take over 2 hour in that hell ... alot of frustration , argueing , translate ... at one point it get real ugly - they want to see my copy of the reservation and confirmation that i have be email .<ssssss>they take it to copy and then refuse to give it back .<ssssss>not sure what that be about but i do get my copy back after 10 minute of demanding.finally , they ship we off to another property about 5 mile away - the catalonia bavaro .<ssssss>it be beautiful , relax ... truely a slice of heaven on earth .<ssssss>2 day later , barcelo call and want to move we back to they property ... hahaha ... no way jose ' !<ssssss>so ... in conclusion , i guess i should thank barcelo for send we to a better hotel ... but , i will never book with barcelo again.hasta la vista , baby !!<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 3 5 5 3		okay , but not fantastic .<ssssss>i just return from a week at ocean blue .<ssssss>this be my tenth trip to the dominican republic , fourth time to punta cana .<ssssss>i have stay in a variety of resort , from a 3 star to a 5 star .<ssssss>this resort i would have to rate between a 3.5 and 4 star resort .<ssssss>i stay from august 26th to september 2nd , with 3 other adult .<ssssss>here be a brief overview of the main aspect of the resort.reception - check in and check out be very quick and the reception staff be extremely friendly and helpful .<ssssss>one of we room need a tv remote and a new shower plug and they have a service man come and deliver it within 30 minute .<ssssss>they all speak almost perfect english , but try to teach we a couple of spanish thing too.rooms - the room be ok , this be where i would say the resort be only 3.5 star .<ssssss>they seem pretty run down for only be about 2 year old .<ssssss>the lighting be horrible .<ssssss>we have a room that face the service road of we hotel and the neighbor hotel , and it be not loud at all .<ssssss>the bathroom be ok , a lack of water pressure and hot water at certain time of the day .<ssssss>the safe be free , which be a bonus because it usually cost $ 30 for the week.restaurants - the a la carte restaurant be by far the best place to eat .<ssssss>the food at the main buffet be usually cold and not that much variety compare to a 4 + star resort .<ssssss>the beach buffet for lunch be really good , and it be always warm .<ssssss>it usually have the same thing every day , but i have a lot of food allergy so that be ok with I .<ssssss>i always find something to eat without have to worry about my allergy .<ssssss>we be there at a slow time of year , so there be not any large line-up for dinner ever .<ssssss>i find that most people do not go for dinner until after 8pm though .<ssssss>service - the staff at this resort be amazing !<ssssss>all of the waiters/waitresses that we speak to be exceptional .<ssssss>most of they speak quite a bit of english as well , and if they do not they would go get someone to translate .<ssssss>i have never have such good service from the wait staff before .<ssssss>this be the best part of the trip .<ssssss>the bar staff be fantastic as well .<ssssss>they always know who be next in line , and make sure that everyone be serve promptly .<ssssss>i do not think we ever wait more than 2 minute to get a drink .<ssssss>we maid be very friendly .<ssssss>we leave she either money or a little gift everyday and she would usually chase we down the hallway to say hello and thank you .<ssssss>even the staff that clean the grounds be very well speak and friendly .<ssssss>pool - the pool here be the best that i have see in term of the size and depth .<ssssss>they both have swim-up pool bar and a few land area in the middle that you could swim around .<ssssss>the only problem here be that they do not seem very clean , and they be start to fall apart as well .<ssssss>again , odd to see at a 2 year old resort .<ssssss>there be always plenty of lounger at any time of day .<ssssss>beach - again the beach area have plenty of lounger with shade , all day long .<ssssss>the beach at we resort seem to be the cleanest , not much seaweed wash up on to shore .<ssssss>there be 2 bar on the beach to get drink and bottled water .<ssssss>activity - the animation staff be not that active throughout the day .<ssssss>they would announce activity and then that be it .<ssssss>sometimes the activity would run , and sometimes they would not .<ssssss>the animation staff be never there on time , so nothing ever start when they say it would and they do not try to get people to participate .<ssssss>most time they would walk by and not even say hello .<ssssss>the show at night appear to be do fairly well , use the same animation staff that they have during the day .<ssssss>maybe it just take the day for they to wake up , or there boss be only there at night .<ssssss>not sure , but i definitely do not think they be up to a 4 star resort .<ssssss>all in all , this be a okay resort .<ssssss>i do not think that i would go back to this resort because i have be to other resort for the same price that be a far superior resort .<ssssss>the other thing that really bother I about this place be that on the weekend , there be quite a few people that would come from a island near-by -lrb- not dominican 's -rrb- that would invade the resort .<ssssss>these people be so rude and pushy that even the bar staff and the wait staff be visibly annoyed .<ssssss>a major annoyance for the day that they be there .<ssssss>any question , feel free to email I .<ssssss>

3 2 -1 5 2 3 -1 -1		unsure about this one i be unsure about this hotel .<ssssss>we book it after read the great review on tripadvisor , and we have never be let down by any of the property that we have find this way , until the fusion.ou main issue with the property be the noise .<ssssss>not from the street , but the people in the room next to we .<ssssss>the wall sound like they be make of paper .<ssssss>we could hear everything from the other room .<ssssss>talk , tv 's , phone , people use the bathroom -lrb- and i do not mean the hotel plumbing ! -rrb-<ssssss>nothing be leave to the imagination .<ssssss>on top of that the noise from above room sound like elephant be race round and round.the weather be warm while we be there so we want the window open , -lrb- we have a internal room -rrb- but the noise from the other room with they window open mean it be not a option .<ssssss>we end up have to use ear plug for the entire stay.we be offer another room , but when we go to check it out , the tv next door be blare , so it be not a viable option.the other issue we have be the house keep .<ssssss>when we check in the room be immaculate .<ssssss>however after that it go downhill .<ssssss>we re-use we towel so do not want they replace every day , however some day they would take towel and not replace they at all .<ssssss>the floor be not vacuum for about 3 day , breakfast crumb stay for the whole weekend .<ssssss>on the plus side , the location be brilliant .<ssssss>you could walk to shop , the cable car , restaurant , the information centre and transport.i be not sure if we just get they at a off time , as previous review have be excellent , but i would struggle to recommend the hotel to to family and friend .<ssssss>-lrb- sorry for the late review , we have be travel since then -rrb-<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		stylish , smaller business hotel i hold a conference at the ac diplomatic in january , 2004 .<ssssss>the hotel be modern , stylish , and located just a block off the passieg de gracia in downtown barcelona .<ssssss>it be 6-8 block from the placa de catalunya , which sit at the top of the old town and the gothic quarter -- a quick walk .<ssssss>nice room , a great gym with roof terrace , and decent service .<ssssss>
2 2 4 2 4 1 2 2		bad location and service , good room now that i have be at the hotel i canÂ´t believe how mislead some review can be .<ssssss>there be no way to call this hotel 's location even good .<ssssss>basically you have to take the metro anywhere you want to go , maybe except la sagrada familia .<ssssss>this be not as bad as could be because barcelona have a great -lrb- a affordable -rrb- transport system .<ssssss>also the area , although be very safe and quiet , have another problem , which be that there be not one decent place around to dine or even have breakfast .<ssssss>on the good side : the room and bathroom be spacious for european standard and everything be really clean .<ssssss>we have free wireless access in the room , which be a plus until it break and be not fix for two days.as mention in other review the staff be really unattentive -lrb- will not even nod at you when you come in -rrb- give the hotel a really cold atmosphere .<ssssss>they efficiency be doubtful too since : - they place we in a smoking floor without ask first - when we be leave they try to charge we unduly minibar expense - they would not even apologize for not fix the wireless access for two days.the only reason to stay here be that the price you pay -lrb- al least through the internet website -rrb- be pretty reasonable for a 3 star in barcelona .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 2 2 -1		do not book here !!!<ssssss>i have be to many country and stay in many place that i have pay as little as $ 7 night .<ssssss>i have never stay in any place as bad as this .<ssssss>if i know it be safe to sleep in a park in amsterdam i would have rather have do that .<ssssss>i do not see how they could legally charge 123 euro a night .<ssssss>even if you be drunk , etc you would not want to sleep here .<ssssss>the people who have write good review must know of some new drug or they be associate with this nightmare .<ssssss>want to know why it be so bad :1 -rrb- ceiling fan in the room only have three blade and they be all bent down .<ssssss>oh .<ssssss>.<ssssss>it do not work either ... 2 -rrb- it be very cool outside , but hot as hell inside and you could not open a window .<ssssss>i mean very hot .<ssssss>we would lay we clothes out so that right when you get dry off after a shower you throw you clothes on and get out before you start sweating .3 -rrb- shower be nasty nasty .4 -rrb- tv remote do not work , and tv only work sometimes .5 -rrb- room be very , very , very small .<ssssss>do not count on see any room like the photo on they website.the only good thing i can say be that the hotel room force you to spend as little time as possible in the room and to spend all you time out see the sites.uggggh !<ssssss>i hope one day i will be able to forget this scary place !<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 2 2 -1		beautiful hotel , service , so-so ... my husband and i recently return from a 2 night stay at the condado plaza hotel and casino .<ssssss>we stay at the hotel prior to we cruise .<ssssss>i have be go to puerto rico all of my life -lrb- 37 year -rrb- and it be my favorite place in the world .<ssssss>we have visit san juan last year and stay at the caribe hilton .<ssssss>when we be visit last year we go by the condado plaza hotel and casino and have see all of the renovation .<ssssss>we know we be go to come back in 2008 and note it as a place to stay .<ssssss>upon we arrival we be meet with a very long line for check in .<ssssss>there be actually only 1 person at the check in desk upon we arrival but slowly more people start to help out .<ssssss>we wait about 20 minute and then we be assist .<ssssss>we be tell that the only ocean view room that be available have 2 queen bed as oppose to the 1 king bed we have request .<ssssss>we say it be o.k. and be give we key to room # 842 .<ssssss>the room be perfect .<ssssss>the renovation of both the lobby and the room be great .<ssssss>we have a great balcony with a perfect view of the ocean .<ssssss>the bathroom be really nice and everything be very clean .<ssssss>the bed be also very comfortable and after we first night we both note what a great , restful sleep we have .<ssssss>we visit the casino and have a good time .<ssssss>eat breakfast both morning at the gusto d'italia restaurant .<ssssss>the food be very good and plentiful , the service not so great .<ssssss>the waiter be not overly friendly and we have to ask for thing more than once .<ssssss>we have ice cream in the gusto d'italia one night and the ice cream attendant be very nice .<ssssss>the bar be also very nice and they make a great pina colada .<ssssss>the beach area be very small and be quite shaded so we opt to sit by the rock wall on the side of the hotel .<ssssss>it be extremely peaceful and the sound of the wave be wonderful .<ssssss>the elevator , i have to say , be very quick .<ssssss>i have read on several review about how slow they be but we do not find this to be a problem .<ssssss>we biggest complaint be when we call down to the desk and ask for 2 more towel and 2 wash cloth as they have not be replenish by the room attendant the day before .<ssssss>what they bring we be 1 towel and when my husband explain that we need 1 more towel and 2 wash cloth be tell they would be come right away .<ssssss>after a hour have pass , and they still have not arrive , my husband call the front desk and be tell that they be very busy and be not sure when they could get they to we .<ssssss>this for we be a big turn off as a hotel of this caliber should have stock the towel in the room to begin with and then they should have definitely bring we what we request but then to be tell they be too busy , that be not right .<ssssss>fortunately this be we only complaint and hope to visit the condado plaza hotel and casino again in the very near future .<ssssss>all in all , we would highly recommend a stay at the condado plaza hotel and casino .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		horrible elevator will ruin you stay ... while it have be say by many other reviewer , it can not be stress enough how much of a annoyance and inconvenience the horrible elevator at this hotel be .<ssssss>the hotel be still renovate , but it look to I like most elevator car be work .<ssssss>sign all over the hotel tout how the new elevator system be now more efficient .<ssssss>i would call it the stupidest elevator design ever , whose only purpose be to make guest furious .<ssssss>the idea be you enter you destination floor on a keypad and be assign a elevator car .<ssssss>while great in theory , this system be a total disaster in practice .<ssssss>expect total chaos and 10-15min wait for a elevator during busy time .<ssssss>then you be pack like sardine in a car with 20 other fume guest .<ssssss>make thing even more confusing be three to four mariott employee try to herd guest on the ground floor .<ssssss>sometimes you be suppose to use the new system , sometimes you be suppose to listen to the people .<ssssss>it be madness and put you in a terrible mood.while the location be good and room nice , the elevator as well as sometimes rude management put this hotel on the to be avoid if at all possible list .<ssssss>
2 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		limited use of free stay coupon i have be stay at this hotel on and off for 9 month , build up plenty of night on the house coupon .<ssssss>i be fine with this as it be a great location , a big enough size room for one person and relatively cheap compare to other hotel in the financial district .<ssssss>however i when i try to use my night on the house coupon this month i be inform that they be not valid for may and june .<ssssss>i will no longer be stay here and will switch to another hotel where i can actually use my point !<ssssss>
1 2 4 5 4 1 1 -1		think again before you book this hotel my wife and i book a quick weekend getaway in what we hear be the hotel to stay at in puerto rico .<ssssss>have be to puerto rico many time and never stay here we decide to give it a shot .<ssssss>i read the earlier review of service be terrible in puerto rico , but we have have pretty good experience at we previous stay at the caribe hilton and the el conquistador.we check in on a friday and have no complaint .<ssssss>we room be beautiful !!<ssssss>the pool area be also great .<ssssss>we experience start to change when we order room service .<ssssss>it take approximately two and a half hour to get we meal .<ssssss>this however be the lest of we problem .<ssssss>saturday morning we go to starbuck and attempt to charge the coffee to the room , however i be tell that my credit limit be exceed .<ssssss>so instead of wait on the long line at the front desk to see what go wrong i pay cash .<ssssss>we go to the beach for the day and when we come back to we room we key do not work .<ssssss>we proceed back down to the lobby only to be tell that we room be lock intentionally .<ssssss>the clerk at the front desk give a explanation of my credit card be refuse .<ssssss>be that i do not have a limit on my credit card i find it interesting and ask to have they key back to the room so i could go to the safe and get my phone to call my bank .<ssssss>they would only let I go the room with a security guard .<ssssss>once i call my bank they tell my card be freeze for unusual activity .<ssssss>they read I the list of charge and everything seem okay until they tell I the charge at the el san juan hotel .<ssssss>the charge be double the amount of the quote price of I stay .<ssssss>the clerk that put it through put it through nine time !!!<ssssss>thats right nine time !!!<ssssss>the front desk deny it say the only try to charge $ 100 and it do not go through .<ssssss>i be a loyal starwood member and i will wait until the w be open in puerto rico until i return .<ssssss>
3 4 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		good location and value , but service be below average my wife and i stay at the holiday inn darling harbor for a week , and overall it be certainly a decent hotel .<ssssss>darling harbor be a good location for tourist activity and the room rate at this hotel be reasonable for sydney .<ssssss>it be my understanding that this particular holiday inn be recently rennovate .<ssssss>we room be spaceous and well-appointed , with the only downside be the bathroom - which must not have be a high priority in the rennovation budget .<ssssss>but we bathroom be certainly bearable.the biggest weakness that we encounter here be the service .<ssssss>for example , they concierge desk do not have much of a clue when it come to the most basic question about sydney .<ssssss>but then again , this be a holiday inn .<ssssss>so i be foolish to expect much .<ssssss>the other element that may disappoint you be the gym , which be in a dingy room behind the laundry facility and do not have much in the way of equipment.if you be want to request a particular room i would recommend ask for something on a upper floor face the financial distict -lrb- george street -rrb- .<ssssss>the only potential problem that you might come across with room location might be face directly into the monorail , which run right next to this hotel and may give off some unwanted noise .<ssssss>otherwise , you should not be disappoint with this hotel .<ssssss>especially if you come in with holiday inn-esque expectation ...<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 3 1 -1		it be a showcase we book the hotel 's spring package and stay for two night on april 21st 2007 .<ssssss>the location of the hotel be excellent .<ssssss>it be in the shuiguan valley , surround by beautiful hill and a view of the magnificent great wall .<ssssss>it be unfortunate that the service do not compliment the breath take view.i take a nap on the day of arrival and wake up with a stiff neck and a headache .<ssssss>the pillow be too high for I .<ssssss>i call housekeeping and ask they if they have a different pillow .<ssssss>they say they do not .<ssssss>i think i have better speak with the front desk instead , maybe they would be more creative .<ssssss>i be lucky to run into the resident manager and tell he my request .<ssssss>he tell I that he would be able to arrange for a different pillow .<ssssss>i go back to my room that night , and the same pillow be on the bed .<ssssss>i talk to housekeeping again and they repeat that they could not offer any alternative .<ssssss>i sleep on a roll up bath towel that night .<ssssss>the next day we go to two of the bungalow that be open for public viewing .<ssssss>i see the thinner pillow that i need .<ssssss>i go to the front desk again and tell they i find the alternative .<ssssss>the receptionist call the housekeeping department with much resentment and tell they to change the pillow for me.we stay in one of the room in share house 3 .<ssssss>there be altogether 6 room in the house .<ssssss>all the guest share the living room and the kitchen .<ssssss>the dirty dish pile up in the sink for two day and no one take care of it .<ssssss>the overflow gabbage in the kitchen be clear only on the day we leave .<ssssss>we feel like we be college student stay in a expensive dormitory.the room that we stay be very cramp .<ssssss>we could only watch tv on the bed .<ssssss>there be hardly any space for laggage .<ssssss>there be no place in the shower stall to keep we toiletries .<ssssss>we have to place they on the floor.menu in the restuarant offer very limited choice and it be over price .<ssssss>we feel the choice should be more international .<ssssss>to have three different type of eleborated chinese cuisine and only one basic western menu be really off .<ssssss>the choice at the buffet breakfast be only three star standard.all in all , we do not enjoy the accomodation and the food choice .<ssssss>we expect service of a 5 star hotel if not of the higher rank from kempinski .<ssssss>in we opinion , service and pillow from the sheraton chain be better then the commune .<ssssss>we would go back to enjoy the beautiful view but we will not stay at the commune again .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 4 4 2 -1		would spend my money elsewhere although the trip be not terrible , i would not recommend this resort or island .<ssssss>there be many other beautiful place in the world to visit .<ssssss>the resort be large - seperate in 3 section : 1 -rrb- punta cana , 2 -rrb- bavaro , 3 -rrb- ambar -lrb- adult only -rrb- .<ssssss>we book the bavaro but be place in the ambar section .<ssssss>apaprently accord to the mangement , it be just the luck of the draw of how you be place in the resort - so there be no point in pay the extra for ambar as the 4 other couple we travel with be all also place in ambar .<ssssss>we have a corner jr. suit which be very spacious but have a mustly basement smell .<ssssss>the ambar section bracelet allow you go go to all section of the resort but they try to limit you to only the ambar section - i call to make dinner reserveation at a resutrant in the bavaro section and i be tell i can not .<ssssss>but then i go to the bavaro lobby and place the reservation in person with out a problem .<ssssss>besides for these logistics which be common for a all inclusive resort , the aspect of the vacation that drive this review be the staff .<ssssss>the employee rarely smile , rarely speak with you or say hello .<ssssss>and if they do it seem force .<ssssss>it be a little ackward .<ssssss>i would not recommend even tip the employee because that do not guarantee any better service -lrb- except for the maid - she be great and friendly -rrb- .<ssssss>also if plan to travel , ensure to bring all denomination of usd or pay with credit card .<ssssss>the hotel and its shop never have change .<ssssss>also bring extra sun block as they charge $ 25 - $ 30 per bottle at the resort shop .<ssssss>the beach and pool be nice .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 2 4 2 1		first impression be deceive the reception area and lounge be extremely pleasant and invite , but once you arrive on the guest room floor it begin to fall apart .<ssssss>i pay extra for a garden room which mean i have french door onto a airshaft with 10 foot wall on all side ; even worse , the guest at the pool could look down into the air shaft and my room ... so absolutely no privacy .<ssssss>the room itself be a nice size but the furnishings be worn.there be little steet noise in my room but there be substantial noise from room on either side and upstairs.internet connection do not work and room be not clean until after 3:00 thoughout trip .<ssssss>
5 5 4 4 4 5 5 1		amazing view and great service the view be spectacular - stay in a harbour view room it be absolutely worth it .<ssssss>the service here be also fantastic by all member of staff .<ssssss>actually feel like they really do care that you enjoy you stay at the hotel -lrb- not often the case -rrb- .<ssssss>the chinese restaurant here be very good for upscale and fairly pricey dim sum .<ssssss>the pricey snack in the lounge be also good , and the cost reflect the value of the view.not sure if i would stay in tst / kowloon again .<ssssss>really hate most of it , particularly be tout constantly for tailor / knock off goods , etc. but if i do it would be here for the view , and the service .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 4 5 -1 3		great location , ok room just to reiterate what other have say : this hotel be make up of two building .<ssssss>the older -lrb- historic -rrb- building , where the petite room be , be definitely a older style -- smaller , darker , a little musty .<ssssss>i do not stay in the newer , poolside building , but it look much larger and more modern .<ssssss>make sure you know which part of the hotel you be book into.that say , my petite room be clean and the staff be pleasant .<ssssss>the bed be a little small and the pillow be way too thick , but some hotel just seem to think that be a good idea .<ssssss>the mini-fridge be a bonus .<ssssss>and the location be hard to beat for tourism -- smack dab in the center of the city , just two block from the powell st. bart and muni station .<ssssss>i would stay here again if i get a good deal .<ssssss>san francisco have a lot of fleabag hotel -lrb- especially further west on geary -rrb- , but this be not one of they .<ssssss>

2 1 1 4 1 2 2 -1		avoid if possible there be only 2 thing go for this hotel -- its location and its breakfast buffet .<ssssss>we should have hear warn bell from the outset when we be make we reservation -- the person be audibly typing on he computer the entire time and be not pay attention to anything i be ask .<ssssss>i have to keep repeat myself and the only time he truly snap to attention be when i confirm my reservation .<ssssss>when we check in , the room on the higher floor that i would request -lrb- note -- it be the higher floor that have be renovate -rrb- be not ready .<ssssss>we be give one on a low floor .<ssssss>i decide to give it a chance but it be not long before we find 1 -rrb- the previous occupant ' crusty oily stain on the sheet and hair in the sink , and 2 -rrb- that the bathtub be not work -lrb- the stopper be screw so there could be no chance of soak in the tub -rrb- .<ssssss>a technician come to try to fix the tub , but he could not .<ssssss>he have the sense to say he would ask for another room for us.we eventually get another room -- on the supposedly renovate higher floor -- but on enter with the porter , we be all appal to find the toilet repeatedly flush and overflow .<ssssss>the bathroom floor be flood .<ssssss>i be not prepare to repack all my stuff again , so we sit down and wait for a technician to fix that and housekeeping to come clean up the bathroom .<ssssss>the technician take age to come -lrb- while gallon of water continue pour out -rrb- , and housekeeping take even longer .<ssssss>we be die to pee !<ssssss>and in the meantime , we find some creamy white stuff on the sheet ... honestly , like i would say , the only thing go for this hotel be the location -- be very central and connected to a nice mall -- and its breakfast buffet -- yummy , substantial and in a very pleasant environment .<ssssss>if you get one of those unrenovated room , be prepare for thing not work and icky stuff on the old furnishings .<ssssss>housekeeping be horribly inefficient -- you could be go for 3 hour or even 6 , and you room can still not be make up .<ssssss>and the scum on the bathtub be proof of how well they do they job.the bathroom , incidentally , be not child-friendly -- there be only a fix shower overhead , which mean you will have difficulty wash you little one down .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 2 3 1 5		pass if you can ok , i know it be go to be expensive .<ssssss>i be think it would be ok for one night .<ssssss>i have a early flight and i like the convenience of the airport .<ssssss>unfortunately there be too many other bad thing to say about the service , the price and the value .<ssssss>on the upside , the room and the bath be both very large with nice soap and body wash , et cetera .<ssssss>there be a great tv and movie in several language plus internet and of course great airport access .<ssssss>so i be initially please with the amenity .<ssssss>unfortunately , the room have a very bad -lrb- stale -rrb- smell and the window would not open .<ssssss>by the way no one else among the staff could smell what i be smell and they could only offer another room for a even higher price .<ssssss>the concierge be not able to recommend a single cafe or shopping area that would be open on a sunday afternoon in frankfurt .<ssssss>the dining room be elegant , but the food be only ok .<ssssss>the salad bar be stale and the service be extremely slow .<ssssss>the staff seem to be more interested in talk among themselves than serve guest .<ssssss>overall , the meal be way over price .<ssssss>so i return to my smelly room .<ssssss>room service be ok and my night time snack be good .<ssssss>the wall be so thin i could hear every person that walk near my room .<ssssss>after a bad night 's sleep on a king bed , i checked-out and go to the airport where i find over price food of equal quality for half the cost of the sheraton .<ssssss>even if you do have lot of money to throw away and even if it be just for one night , my advice be to take a extra few minute and find another choice .<ssssss>i think we can expect more from a sheraton and at these price i feel certain you will get a lot more elsewhere .<ssssss>

5 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		perfect fantastic hotel .<ssssss>i cant understand why its not higher up in you review .<ssssss>i pick it from the recommendation on this site as i couldnt find any availaility in the higher review hotel for the time that i want to travel.a short walk from the train station , about 5 minute away from the tourist attraction .<ssssss>very clean , modern the staff be very helpful with find place to eat etc.the lighting in the room be quite unique and with the window close you cant hear anything from the street below .<ssssss>-lrb- add that in since it seem to be a issue with other review of florence ive read on you site -rrb- .<ssssss>perfect place for the stay !<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		perfect location , heavenly bed we take a last minute trip to nyc and stay at the marriott marquis because my sister rave about it .<ssssss>i think the location be perfect !<ssssss>the sushi bar be fabulous and the drink at the broadway lounge be perfect at the end of the day.we have sunday brunch at the view which be lovely and delicious but way too pricey to do again .<ssssss>this would be perfect in the evening to see all of the light of the city as the restaurant be on the 43rd floor and rotates.we be delay at the lincoln tunnel so have to cancel we dinner plan but the conceirge reccommend a nice italian place trattatoria dolo posto treatre -lrb- sp ? -rrb-<ssssss>which have unbelievably great italian food.i be dissappointed regard the lack of a pool but the room be very clean and the bedding be exceptionally comfortable .<ssssss>there be plenty of treadmill available and they be the one with individual tv 's .<ssssss>the only downside be when it happen to be busy the elevator 's get crazy .<ssssss>it take forever to go up to the eighth floor get we bag and then go down to the 1st floor for we car .<ssssss>also , on sunday afternoon there be always a line at the conceirge and if you call you be put on hold indefinately .<ssssss>i just have one question about a location that would have take 2 seconds to answer but i could not wait any longer.parking be pricey -lrb- $ 50 a day -rrb- but i do not know of any option .<ssssss>i would definately stay here again .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 3 1 3		terrible experience i stay at the sheraton princess kaiulanus from 2/7 -2 / 12/08 to attend a family member 's wedding and i be very disappointed with the overall experience .<ssssss>we basically receive a room that be not as describe in the original reservation and the only accommodation the hotel have available be for a upgrade which we have to pay for .<ssssss>the only explanation the front desk could give we be that all basic room be describe as a cityview room with balcony etc. and that a cityside room which be much smaller with no balcony can also be describe as such .<ssssss>i feel this be very deceptive and we would not have stay there if give that option .<ssssss>we actually have reservation at another hotel but cancel because we think we be get a certain level of accommodation .<ssssss>in addition we have no problem correspond with the group reservation agent keri shiramizu prior to we arrival but after we arrive she do not respond to a voicemail or email regard the room situation .<ssssss>overall we have a terrible experience with this hotel and will never stay here again .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 5 2 2 -1		glad we get the grand opening rate ... not worth the regular price my husband and i love kimpton hotel , so we be super excite to see this one opening in la , right before my sister wedding .<ssssss>so much so that we also have a dozen of we friend and family book here too.the hotel be gorgeous and the location be great too .<ssssss>we only have breakfast in the restaurant and that be really good .<ssssss>we major complaint be with the hotel willingness to problem solve and accommodate guest when a problem do occur .<ssssss>we problem have to do with the crib provide for we infant daughter .<ssssss>it be not adequete and the hotel 's website claim to have crib specifically for infant , which it do not .<ssssss>also , the crib be not in we room when we check in , at midnight , so it add to the stress of travel with a infant that late at night .<ssssss>when we complain to the hotel staff , the person we speak with say that she be sorry , but that she do not have child so could not understand what we be complain about .<ssssss>the gm contact we as well , after we make several attempt to resolve the matter with the hotel staff .<ssssss>he clearly have be misinform because he criticize we for want a crib bumper -lrb- which we do not want -rrb- ... .<ssssss>if we have the time to spend we entire trip play phone tag in the hope to connect with someone that be willing to fix the problem we would have , but we be there for a wedding and have thing to do.on a seperate note ... i be not sure what the hotel be do to qualify as eco friendly since the light bulb in the lamp be not even the eco friendly variety and the water faucet be the kind that only have temperature control and not volume control.overall , we be extremely dissapointed with the service of the hotel and would not recommend it to a friend , nor would we be likely to stay in another kimpton hotel in the future .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 3 1 1 3		one star service in a three star room at a five star price five star hotel face a lot of trouble with they client because in the service industry customer satisfaction be always tie to expectation .<ssssss>and letâ€™s face it , itâ€™s a tough mix to master : courtesy , consideration , and go the extra mile for a customer without be obsequious or intrusive .<ssssss>itâ€™s a wonder that it happen anywhere .<ssssss>the expectation be that much higher at five star hotelsâ€?price point .<ssssss>a customer naturally expect something for what he or she be paying.but a number of hotel i have be to , particularly in asia , have succeed in this mix to a degree that stun .<ssssss>the peninsula beijing , unfortunately , be not one of they .<ssssss>it be , by far , the poorest excuse for a five star hotel i have ever stay in .<ssssss>letâ€™s start with a few lesser detail .<ssssss>first , the room .<ssssss>i be upgrade to the largest non-suite size room at the club level .<ssssss>most american will probably find the room unbearably small .<ssssss>other reviewer have complain about the cigarette smoke in the nonsmoking room .<ssssss>the peninsula have yet to remedy that situation .<ssssss>the sheet in my room reek of smoke , a error that could have be avoid easily by more attentive management .<ssssss>i will admit that the bathroom be a decent size .<ssssss>and there be cool switch for every light you can think of to the side of the bed , as well as a large plasma tv , though these day itâ€™s pretty rare to find a top property in japan or china that doesnâ€™t have one in every room .<ssssss>you will need to ask the hotel for a adapter if youâ€™re use appliance with american voltage .<ssssss>ask the hotel for anything , however , will usually involve a tip , even if itâ€™s something youâ€™d ordinarily expect a room to have .<ssssss>thereâ€™s a scene in curb you enthusiasm -lrb- episode 40 for fan -rrb- where larry stay at the regency in new york and have to tip the guy who fix the faulty air conditioning .<ssssss>thatâ€™s more or less what service be like at the peninsula.on to the food .<ssssss>breakfast at the jing restaurant be simply dreadful .<ssssss>the spread compare unfavorably to a number of four star iâ€™ve be to , and the quality of the food be simply appalling .<ssssss>the pastry , for example , be uniformly damp , almost stale .<ssssss>thereâ€™s a good omelette station , but i havenâ€™t be to many hotel that have flubb a omelette .<ssssss>the restaurant itself lack a view and be dark , so you kind of feel like youâ€™ve be transport to a high school during a brownout .<ssssss>and then thereâ€™s the service .<ssssss>the staff at jing look and act severely depress , and can be rude to boot .<ssssss>i witness a waitress practically fling coffee at a american customer because she ask for hot coffee after get a cold cup .<ssssss>jing be the worst breakfast experience i have ever have at a hotel.as other reviewer have note , check-in be uncoordinated .<ssssss>when i arrive , my bag be lie around the reception area completely unattended to .<ssssss>after i finish check-in , i have to locate a bellhop to find my bags.by nearly any measure i can think of , the peninsula be a disappointment .<ssssss>ultimately , however , the joylessness of the hotel be its greatest drawback .<ssssss>its employeesâ€?lack of enthusiasm be contagious .<ssssss>and unless itâ€™s important to you to stay in a hotel that sell overpriced designer goods in its basement -lrb- thatâ€™s a draw ? -rrb-<ssssss>, youâ€™ll save ` money and have a better experience at just about any other top hotel in the city .<ssssss>
1 1 3 5 3 1 3 3		not what we pay for as two participant of a conference in new orlean , we decide to lower we cost and share a room .<ssssss>we pay for 6 night of a 2 queen bed non-smoking room at st. chistopher , take advantage a discount coupon at hotels.com .<ssssss>at check-in , the hotel clerk britney declare that the hotel be full and that she could only offer a smoking room with one king bed .<ssssss>confront my unhappiness , she further declare that at the hotel they do not care much about the customer book they room at hotels.com or expedia .<ssssss>my further communication with she be do through hotels.com .<ssssss>unfortunately , the only thing they have offer be a cancellation of the reservation with no penalty on my part !<ssssss>thereafter they suggest that i should call they next morning because they system be go down .<ssssss>with little that we could do right away , we take the room and eventually negotiate through hotels.com get a 2-bed room after 2 night in the hotel .<ssssss>st christopher staff do not offer any other remedy to we problem such as a roll-away bed .<ssssss>throughout we stay , britney exude bad mood towards we and , as far as i could tell , towards other customer as well .<ssssss>the second room have 2 bed , but no window.from other less grave issue , the free wireless internet turn out to be wire which can be a problem when 2 people need to work .<ssssss>the breakfast be generally ok but every second morning they run out of something , such as coffee or spoon , with staff be hard to find or respond after you actually finish you breakfast.the hotel have a very convenient location , next to canal st. the hotel building be historic , with some of the wall expose to show the old brickwork .<ssssss>in we first room , the expose wall have a sizable crack with a gauge put onto it to show whether the crack be grow in size .<ssssss>fortunately it do not grow since the gauge be put on .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 4 4 3		double bed madness this little hotel have oodles of grungy charm , with shutter , fireplace , cornice , a balcony , a work iron spiral staircase etc and its location be lovely .<ssssss>there be load of non-touristy restaurant and shop around -lrb- include a ace organic artisan boulangerie -rrb- - so far , so good .<ssssss>we problem be that we take one of the room for four people .<ssssss>my parent -lrb- fit , mobile and in they late 60 's / eary 70 's -rrb- be fine because we give they the two single bed push together to make a double .<ssssss>we get the the ` double ' - a cheap double mattress balance on what look like a single bed base prop up with cushion .<ssssss>it have a hard mattress protector on it that wrinkle into 2 cm high wave under the sheet , leave we body mark with red ridge that be very painful .<ssssss>my partner and i have four sleepless night , wake up with ache hip , knee and back .<ssssss>yes i be 7 month pregnant so sleep do not necessarily come easy , but this be the worst hotel bed i have ever sleep in , and this hotel be not in the budget range .<ssssss>thus i would say : if there be two of you , go for it .<ssssss>if there be 3 or more , find another , hotel , if necessary compromise on the charm or location - the second bed be not worth it .<ssssss>

2 2 1 5 1 4 2 3		good , bad , and indifferent oh to be young and decadent .<ssssss>the w la be a classic example of style over substance .<ssssss>in that regard , it be perfect.the w cater to the hip and beautiful lo angeleno with nothing better to do than posture at the poolside .<ssssss>there be enough silicone around that pool to float a battleship .<ssssss>it make for pleasant people watch , but try not to stare too much.the hotel itself be ok .<ssssss>frankly , the decor be get a little tired if not downright cliche .<ssssss>the room -lrb- a mega suite penthouse -rrb- be filthy upon we arrival : the bathroom have lot of detritus from the previous occupant , there be food on the carpet next to the couch , the second bathtub have muddy footprint in it , etc. the service folk be certainly cheerful if not particularly helpful .<ssssss>they trademark anything , anytime catchphrase be laughable : the utterly inept valet be either a -rrb- too busy check out the hot woman or b -rrb- too busy think about they screenplay to bother get you car for you.there be waaaaay better place to stay in la .<ssssss>although the location be great , if you need to be on the west side , i would not stay here again - too much money for too little service and too much attitude .<ssssss>for suite accomodation , i would strongly recommend a bungalow at the fairmont miramar before i come back to the w.<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 5 5 5 5		second stay , it be okay .<ssssss>i stay here in 2004 and again recently -lrb- 2007 -rrb- .<ssssss>i be in and out of florence three time in a week and a half this time stay at three different hotel .<ssssss>while this hotel be clean and spacious , the staff always helpful , and the location be very central i be bother by three -lrb- maybe small -rrb- thing .<ssssss>the overhead light be fluorescent and give the room a very cold feeling .<ssssss>the towel be paper thin by design , clean and fresh , but more like a kitchen towel than a soft bath towel .<ssssss>lastly one or more of the family smoke , they live in the hotel and use the common room as they tv or livingroom .<ssssss>while i never see anyone smoking the smell linger even at breakfast .<ssssss>i know the family look at tripadvisor , they have it open often on they computer click through the page .<ssssss>i think these be three very easy fix that would make the hotel warmer and smoke odor free.they do have the biggest shower of my stay and the room be spacious .<ssssss>the bed be fine .<ssssss>they breakfast be nice .<ssssss>the location be very central .<ssssss>the family be very , very helpful .<ssssss>the value for what you get be appropriate .<ssssss>

4 2 4 5 4 5 3 -1		a historic hotel the hotel be a grand place and quite beautiful .<ssssss>it be busy , busy , and set in the middle of a busy district -- but to see the city , the location be good .<ssssss>the room be quiet and adequate .<ssssss>the service be hit and miss .<ssssss>we have to request a bathrobe and that the burn out lightbulb be replace .<ssssss>the minibar continue to lock itself and we have to ask repeatedly for assistance -lrb- they can only unlock it technologically -- there be no key -rrb- .<ssssss>the elevator be overuse and clearly need some maintenance -- they work sporadically .<ssssss>we be charge extra for internet connection and water , as well as $ 45/day for parking !!<ssssss>overall fine , but the hotel be very old and need some maintenance .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 5 4 4 -1		not what it use to be i have stay at this hotel when it be the pan pacific hotel more than a couple dozen of time .<ssssss>i recently stay there after it become the jw marriott .<ssssss>i have always love this hotel .<ssssss>it be a architectural masterpiece .<ssssss>with incredible marble bathroom , stunning lobby and great room this be one of the finest hotel in a city full of great hotel .<ssssss>my only problem be with the renovation convert it to a marriott .<ssssss>before it be a oasis of class .<ssssss>now with the change it have all the charm of a hotel located near a airport .<ssssss>the carpet outside the guest room be hideous and loud .<ssssss>look down the atrium all you see be this ugly carpet totally distract from the beautiful design of the building .<ssssss>the only improvement in the room be new , larger t.v.s. the new furnishings be bland and basic .<ssssss>marriott do a excellent job in remove all of the charm and elegance from this hotel .<ssssss>people who have never stay at this property will most likely love it because it be still a great hotel in a unbeatable location .<ssssss>but for those of we who know it before the change it be very sad .<ssssss>the interior designer and the executive who approve the new design should be sack .<ssssss>while i be there the main lobby be close and be redone .<ssssss>i shudder to think of how marriott will ruin that formerly beautiful space .<ssssss>so i mourn the loss of a great and beautiful hotel .<ssssss>
1 1 2 1 3 3 1 1		very disappointed - do not recommend no idea how people could rate this a good hotel .<ssssss>especially since itâ€™s bill at a 4-star .<ssssss>perhaps i could delude myself it be fine if i feel it be a 2-star and i get a bargainâ€ ut not for this price .<ssssss>be really disappointed especially since we be take my husbandâ€™s parent there for vacation from they home in rainy dublin , ireland .<ssssss>i feel it be far too expensive for the value .<ssssss>every single amenity be individually price .<ssssss>parking be $ 22 per night .<ssssss>internet connection be a minimum of $ 13 .<ssssss>we find a internet cafÃ© downtown that cost we $ 2.00 for 10 minute .<ssssss>i know itâ€™s hard decipher which review to rely on .<ssssss>i be a adamant researcher myself - almost obsessive-compulsive about cross-reference several travel website for reliable info on hotel , i.e. frommer , fodor , trip advisor , travelocity , expedia , hotels.com .<ssssss>if you check more than 3 site say a place be good or bad - it give you the ability to get a median idea - toss out the â€œthis be the greatest place on earthâ€?and the â€œthis be the worst hotel everâ€?comments and you arrive somewhere near the truth of the matter .<ssssss>let I first say i have yet to complain about any one of my hotel stay in either europe , america or mexico .<ssssss>iâ€™m in my early 30â€™s have stay in paris , rome , munich , dublin , d.c. , west palm , texa , miami , cape cod , l.a. , san fran , turk caico , puerto rico , st. kitt , grand bahama paradise island , and various locale in mexico .<ssssss>that be say i would like to warn other about this hotel .<ssssss>i list those locale to merely say that my stay at mbr for the price - be well not worth it .<ssssss>there be no way this hotel deserve a 4 star rating .<ssssss>i have never have a problem with any hotel i have every stay at that be bill as a 3 star hotel or higher .<ssssss>iâ€™ve stay in 2 star hotel / motel that have better service than the miami beach resort spa .<ssssss>when the word resort be place in the name of a hotel you expect high quality .<ssssss>i bring my in-law who fly in from dublin to this hotel in the expectation that with a billing of â€œresort , â€?a title which they be accustom to for beach resort locale in europe , it would be full of amenity .<ssssss>if i have choose simply a hotel i would have expect just room and perhaps a hotel bar .<ssssss>the most impressive feature about this hotel be the lobby .<ssssss>exquisite marble and chandelier - very neat and orderly reservation desk .<ssssss>however , one do not sleep in the lobby .<ssssss>the parking attendant , though harry , be very good about get the car -lrb- except one day which take over 25 minute to get my rental from the garage -rrb- .<ssssss>i book my trip package through expedia for 2 room with a king-size bed .<ssssss>the check in be very smooth , we arrive earlier than the permissible 3pm and they be very amenable to get we check in early .<ssssss>the bellman be very pleasant .<ssssss>however we room be place on separate floor , which in and of itself be not a problem and the lady at the desk do alert we to this fact .<ssssss>funnily enough the desk clerk offer we a mini-bar key which we decline but when we get to the room there be no mini-bar .<ssssss>my husbandâ€™s parent stay on the 10th floor with a partial view of the ocean and bay .<ssssss>we be put on the 4th floor in a newly renovate room which happen to be eye level with the extend roof - so if you picture a ceiling to floor window the tiled floor of we hotel room -lrb- no rug -rrb- be on level with the rooftop of the 3rd floor mezzanine - give we a unsightly grayish black roof .<ssssss>beyond the roof view be a partial view of the ocean and directly across from we room be a high-rise condo complex who have a direct view of we room unless we fully drag the floor to ceiling drape close - which of course then darken the already unwell light room .<ssssss>this room have be renovate to be uber-modern - sky blue wall and ceiling which be fine - a open floor plan so the bed be in the middle of the room a float oak-ish look closet so you could see past the bed into the bathroom area - no privacy at all .<ssssss>not a lot of hang space .<ssssss>plenty of drawer but shallow so you canâ€™t fit much .<ssssss>the shower be great - very modern - huge showerhead - the size of a soccer ball - with a floor to ceiling frosted door .<ssssss>the toilet also have a floor to ceiling frosted door - which be very un-conducive to privacy and tiny to get in and out of because of the way the door swing .<ssssss>the rectangular basin sink be interesting -lrb- but didnâ€™t drain well -rrb- and the mirror be large but they both perpendicularly abut the shower which make difficult for 2 people get ready at same time .<ssssss>the florescent lighting be so low you could barely see to put on make-up .<ssssss>there be no floor to ceiling mirror to check yourself out before you leave the room .<ssssss>iâ€™m all for modern but it also have to be functional .<ssssss>the maid come everyday to clean the room , but perhaps since we entire room be tile , and i personally prefer rug b/c i donâ€™t like walk on tile barefoot , i find that the area near the shower be not clean thoroughly .<ssssss>i have very long hair and would find daily hair that be not pick up by either a mop or vacuum .<ssssss>have say all that - the room be not a major problem with we .<ssssss>the in-lawâ€™s room , in contrast , be lovely .<ssssss>more traditional - clean - large - nice view .<ssssss>so if youâ€™re look for a basic room w/o frill itâ€™s not bad.in term of service - i find , again , for a resort , it to be severely lack in both itâ€™s offering and customer service .<ssssss>the only caveat be the front desk clerk which be all pleasant .<ssssss>the concierge however be a different experience all together .<ssssss>my husbandâ€™s birthday be on july 2nd and we be also down in miami for the july 4th holiday .<ssssss>the first night we be there i ask if there be any restaurant nearby because we be tire we didnâ€™t feel like go to south beach which be about a 7-10 minute ride depend on traffic .<ssssss>he coldly tell we well there werenâ€™t that many option .<ssssss>now , at a resort , one would think youâ€™d have someone whoâ€™s entire job be define by he ability to offer service to customer .<ssssss>he make we feel like we be bother he .<ssssss>iâ€™ve live in nyc my entire life .<ssssss>iâ€™m use to the haughtiness of some of the finer hotels/restaurants/bars .<ssssss>this place be certainly not worthy of such a attitude as one would expect at say the ritz .<ssssss>i go to the concierge to ask if there be any good cuban restaurantsâ€ be responseâ€ $ sure.â€?thatâ€™s it .<ssssss>i go to the concierge twice more to ask for advice on restaurant , thing to do etc. ... when i ask if there be event go on for july 4th - he respond - of course w/o further explanation .<ssssss>it be like be a homicide detective try to pry answer from the murderer .<ssssss>they have no guide to look at for restaurant or activity like most other resort i have be to.if you want to fork over a exorbitant amount of money for sub-par food than stay here .<ssssss>iâ€™ve stay at the hyatt resort - a 5 star hotel in aruba - and there food be less expensive and 5 time better .<ssssss>the breakfast food for 2 people plus a 17 % gratuity -lrb- which be automatically attribute to every single bill at the hotel whether youâ€™re just order fries or a cocktail -rrb- cost we 39 dollar .<ssssss>again , i live in nyc and 2 egg over-easy with ham with one glass of oj do not equal 39 dollar , it equal extortion .<ssssss>we have dinner at they restaurant which do have beautiful view overlook the pool and miami beach .<ssssss>each entrÃ©e be 25 dollar or more and it be horrid - and iâ€™m not a finicky eater .<ssssss>i have mahi-mahus , as do my husband , which turn out look and tasting like a overdo fish sandwich from a fast-food place .<ssssss>i order tuna sashimi as a appetizer - itâ€™s hard to screw up raw fish - but they manage to do so .<ssssss>i didnâ€™t even eat my meal .<ssssss>my husband - not a finicky either - eat it only because it be late and he be starve and we have no other course of action .<ssssss>he parent have steak - which be overcooked - and pasta which be like mush .<ssssss>the bill for 4 people be just shy of $ 300 and the food be awful .<ssssss>i wouldnâ€™t have pay 10 dollar for the food that be serve , so dish out 25 dollar per dish be offensive .<ssssss>do not eat at they restaurant .<ssssss>the pool bar be handy if you ready yourself for just finger food or bbq type of food - but again overprice .<ssssss>one day the four of we have 4 caesar salad , and 2 drink each and it come to $ 125 - this place just literally leave a bad taste in my mouth .<ssssss>you be hold ransom here with such exorbitant price b/c this hotel be located far off the main strip - 10 minute north of south beach or any place to eat on collin avenue .<ssssss>my husband and i walk around one day in search of a deli b/c all we want be a iced tea and a sandwich - needless to say we walk down collin and didnâ€™t reach a deli until we hit south beach .<ssssss>pool be fine - relatively long - not wide - but clean .<ssssss>plenty of lounge and very comfortable cushion .<ssssss>pool side restaurant be decent .<ssssss>maybe 8 thing on menu though so after 2 day you get sick of order a chicken sandwich with greasy fries , or a small burger or a 9 dollar salad .<ssssss>the wing be awful .<ssssss>it have fan hang from rafter which constantly vacillate and mist water .<ssssss>i suppose this be suppose to keep you cool , but i find it annoying - you constantly feel damp while sit there eat .<ssssss>drink be somewhat expensive -lrb- again iâ€™m use to high price in nyc -rrb- but it be $ 6 for domestic bottle of beer , $ 8 for mixed drink and more if you want something off they standard cocktail menu - plus for every drink you order they bang you automatically 17 % gratuity .<ssssss>i bartended in nyc and i find the gratuity ridiculous .<ssssss>staff be friendly enough - if you could wave they down and if per chance they speak english .<ssssss>i live in a melting pot city so iâ€™m use to it but my irish in-law have trouble understand what the staff be say because everyone work as the wait staff , snack bar , or bartender speak broken english.their snack shop charge $ 2.18 for a regular size cup of hot tea and close to 3 buck for a stale bagel with nothing on it .<ssssss>in nyc you can get a bagel for 60 cent .<ssssss>if you want tea for room service it be $ 5 or $ 8 for a large cup of teaâ€ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>for hot water and a lipton bag .<ssssss>they wine be cheaper than hot water for $ 7 .<ssssss>no vend machine in case you simply want a water or a soda.location really not great .<ssssss>iâ€™ve stay in bal harbor -lrb- about 10 min .<ssssss>north of this area -rrb- before and at least you could walk to restaurant or shop .<ssssss>here you can get to a boardwalk via the beach 2 block down .<ssssss>the boardwalk be lovely and you can get a birds-eye view of other hotel .<ssssss>a long hike to get to any other restaurant .<ssssss>but beware thereâ€™s no escape the sun .<ssssss>the beach be clean and there be a hut for wave - runner and other activity if you so desire .<ssssss>but if you want to lay out on the beach -lrb- which be a public beach -rrb- you have to pay for chair and umbrella .<ssssss>i think it be $ 5 for a chair and $ 15 for a umbrella - ridiculous .<ssssss>when you think you be go to a resort - you justly assume this be part of the resort fee - which they charge 10 dollar per room per day - plus tax per day of $ 1.30 - so for 5 day it be $ 56.50 each room .<ssssss>iâ€™m sorry but iâ€™m confuse as to what this fee be forâ€ s another reviewer say - for towel - which be threadbare?bottom line-wouldnâ€™t recommend to anyone - would never stay here again - it be way overprice for what be offered-and i live in nyc for decade , i.e. iâ€™m use to high price .<ssssss>as one reviewer say , â€œThe only thing remotely pleasant about this hotel be that we do not spend much time there.â€?i second that notion .<ssssss>most time we spend there be by the pool .<ssssss>
5 5 3 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great value , great location , great little hotel we be here for one night and find hotel catedral to be a great little hotel for all the reason cite in other review : excellent value , spotlessly clean , great bathroom , potable water on tap , nice and affordable restaurant , secure , and the cleanest starched white cotton sheet i have sleep on in a long time .<ssssss>very simple decor .<ssssss>ask for a room on a high floor on the interior , and you will be shield from noise but get some light.the downside be as previously note : that nightclub club be still rage on a friday night , and the street be abandon and dark by 9 pm , and do not look safe to this woman or she teenager .<ssssss>still , i would definitely stay there again .<ssssss>

1 1 4 3 1 3 3 -1		very mixed feeling this be place be far overprice !<ssssss>and beside the spectacular price , they charge you for basically anything elseâ€ $ nd they know they price .<ssssss>be prepare to pay 4 euro for a in-room coffee make yourself by the coffeemaker in the room -lrb- and then add the tax to it -rrb- or 7 euro for a coke take from you minibar -lrb- again without the tax -rrb- .<ssssss>anything room service bring to the room will be applicable to a 6 euro delivery charge on top of the already high price .<ssssss>just to give you a idea !<ssssss>at these rate you would expect it to be flawless .<ssssss>but itâ€™s far from that .<ssssss>when we arrive in the room the toilet be far from clean and contain stain of shâ€ from the previous guest .<ssssss>we immediately call the manager on duty who , after 25 minute , arrive to the room .<ssssss>he act shocked and advise to send housekeeping right away .<ssssss>this take another 30 minute and when the girl leave , nothing be change .<ssssss>again we call the manager and come up to the room with the head housekeeping .<ssssss>naturally both be shock and housekeeping be call again .<ssssss>then thing be clean as they be suppose to !<ssssss>as a gesture for the inconvenience we receive a dinner for two !<ssssss>and thatâ€™s where the hotel come in place for itâ€™s 5 star status .<ssssss>the food all over the hotel be simply great .<ssssss>from dinner to breakfast .<ssssss>absolutely great quality.be also aware that the hotel be extremely noisy .<ssssss>be on the 25th floor , we still hear traffic and people party on the beach for almost the whole night.all in all a disappointing experience and not something we would consider a second time !<ssssss>

4 4 2 4 4 2 5 4		many more positive than negative it seem that there be quite a few of we write review who happen to be there at the same time .<ssssss>here be we take : airportus agree with the other comment regard the bag porter .<ssssss>take you bag and hold on to they .<ssssss>the bus area be only a few foot away , it be not worth get you help , especially since the only reason they be there be because they refuse to let you take the bag stroller the remain few step .<ssssss>unfortunately , come back to the airport on we bus , you really have no choice .<ssssss>they swoon in on bus when they arrive , and we bag be already in they hand by the time we step off the bus.check-inthis be the worst experience of the trip .<ssssss>due to travel with small child , we decide to book royal service due to some thing that we feel would make we trip more enjoyable -lrb- such as preferred reservation for restaurant , etc. . -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the bus drop you off at main check-in .<ssssss>when i tell they that it be royal service that i be look for , i be tell to wait for someone to take I there .<ssssss>i understand the carribean lifestyle , but after wait 30 minute , i go back to speak with check-in .<ssssss>i be tell that i should never have be ask to wait , and they proceed to check I in .<ssssss>at the point where they give you the wristband , i confirm that this be royal service , and they explain that it be not .<ssssss>they check my reservation again and see that we indeed need royal service , so they tell I to wait again .<ssssss>this time , it only take two minute to get whisk away to royal service check-in by golf cart .<ssssss>if we have know then what we know now , we would have walk the 30 seconds it take to get to royal service check-in from main check-in .<ssssss>roomsdisappointing .<ssssss>very spacious and well-appointed .<ssssss>however , all furniture smell like stagnant water as though wet guest have be sit on they .<ssssss>this make the room in general smell less than satisfactory , but not enough to ruin we stay .<ssssss>when you pay for royal service , you just expect a clean smell room .<ssssss>other than that , housekeeping be adequate .<ssssss>they come daily to clean we room thoroughly and to refill the minibar .<ssssss>they be not too good with foresight , for example , as a kleenex box with one remain kleenex be not replenish , etc. .<ssssss>further , air conditioning be out for three day .<ssssss>luckily , we be on the shaded side , so we room hover around 70 degree regardless , but other we speak to be uncomfortable in they 78 degree rooms.resortabsolutely huge and amazing .<ssssss>very well manicure , the place look awesome .<ssssss>the train be quite efficient at get you where you want to go , and the royal service golf cart complete what be necessary to get around here .<ssssss>definitely take the time to walk from the beach to you room .<ssssss>there be lot to see , and you will likely miss out on thing if you just rely on transportation.foodadequate .<ssssss>i would not go as far as some other reviewer say that it be awful .<ssssss>dominican be certainly not know for spicy food , so a lot of what we eat just taste bland , but not horrible .<ssssss>there be several enjoyable thing to eat everywhere we stop , so we come nowhere close to starve .<ssssss>restaurant on the tropical side be close at this time of year , so we have the choice of guarapo -lrb- dominican -rrb- , the italian , ma maison -lrb- french -rrb- , capri -lrb- seafood -rrb- , hokkaido -lrb- japanese -rrb- , and the international buffet that be house in what be normally the mexican restaurant when the tropical side be open -lrb- hence why the previous reviewer find that there be no mexican food at the mexican restaurant -rrb- .<ssssss>there be also snack place , such as turey on the beach that be nice and convenient for lunch .<ssssss>royal service also give you access to the gabi club that be fantastic for breakfast .<ssssss>note that royal service guest can book into restaurant earlier than other guest , so we have no issue get into wherever we want to go .<ssssss>i highly recommend hokkaido if you have child .<ssssss>while the food be adequate and be standard sit-around-the-grill japanese fare , the staff be very entertaining , and we child could not get enough of them.beachlovely , fine sand .<ssssss>no rock .<ssssss>seaweed be not horrible - staff obviously clean up frequently , but there be a storm off-shore that make the water a little choppy and hence dislodge more seaweed than typical , especially in the last few day of we trip .<ssssss>wave be safe for yound child ... i want more and bigger , but this be the wrong location be you be look for surfing .<ssssss>royal service have a private beach area with a bar -lrb- for those say that you need a bar on the beach -rrb- .<ssssss>non royal service beach do not have a bar.poolsgreat pool , lot of variety .<ssssss>if you go during the slow season certainly stop by the tropical side .<ssssss>pool to yourselve .<ssssss>we find out about this on we first day as we be investigate the kid ' club right next to tropical pool.kids ' clubour baby be treat like royalty .<ssssss>at this time of year , she be the only baby around , so she have personal service .<ssssss>definitely seek out dania and raquel - they be awesome .<ssssss>kid ' club for we 5 year-old be a disappointment .<ssssss>it be probably really good when the resort be full , but this be the downpart of low season - no kid for she to play with .<ssssss>she opt not to go to the kid ' club and spend she time with we instead.languagenot one to mince word , i have to tell you that this be a spanish country .<ssssss>if you ethnocentrism be go to cause you to have a bad time because the local can not understand you to you satisfaction , then i suggest that you would be better off either stay home , or choose a island that be english-speaking .<ssssss>please do not be a ugly tourist .<ssssss>go and enjoy the people , they will try hard to work with you if you try hard to work with they .<ssssss>learn a few simple spanish phrase can go a long way.peopleall of the staff be fantastic .<ssssss>be careful not to take they to they word when it come to time -

4 4 5 3 5 3 5 -1		have a great time - very nice just get back from puerto rico and we stay the last three night at the rio mar. i think the place be great and worth the price -lrb- $ 159 through travelocity - they upgrade I to a ocean view room -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be huge and very well take care of .<ssssss>the pool be great and very relaxing .<ssssss>the service be top notch .<ssssss>it be on semi private beach , so it feel very safe .<ssssss>i would say that it be not the best beach on the island , as there be some small wave and it be fill with live sand dollar that my wife do not like step on , but the water be warm and they have two great pool anyway .<ssssss>also , i would say that the restaurant be very expensive and not very authentic , but we have a car , and there be a great restaurant 5 minute away at the bottom of the hill -lrb- cheap authentic - antohito , or something like that -rrb- .<ssssss>i would highly recommend this place .<ssssss>

2 2 4 2 4 2 3 3		the facility be lovely but ... i have to agree with other who say the restaurant choice be limit and over price .<ssssss>we also have a problem with a fire alarm go off several time in the middle of the night .<ssssss>when we call the front desk to let someone in authority know no one ever answer .<ssssss>it seem like there be a lot of worker bee at the hotel but no one of any real authority .<ssssss>the beach be disappointing but we do enjoy the pool and the spa .<ssssss>the taxi service be very expensive and everything be so far away .<ssssss>overall , i think this resort have a lot of potential but they seem content to be mediocre .<ssssss>i would not recommend it to my friend because for the money it be not worth it .<ssssss>

3 3 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		meh ... the good - signature vacation be good .<ssssss>there be little bonus by book through they .<ssssss>- skyservice be good in term of service , and that there meal be hot and actually taste decent - weather be great ; lot of sunshine !<ssssss>sometimes it be a little too windy so if you like to hang out at the beach , you might end up eat some sand .<ssssss>there be lot of shade by the beach by go under those straw umbrella - drink be ok ... wait for barstaff to acknowledge you be incredibly sloooooow - i like the layout of the room , but we have problem with we closet door - it do not make sense that both door can not be fully slide open together - food be decent , we go to the steak restaurant and it be ok .<ssssss>i would advise not to go to the asian one - the food look really simple and boring - resort be generally very clean , and very beautiful at night - beach have blue water and some coral for snorkeling .<ssssss>if you walk slightly beyond the property towards the north side , there be a lot more coral-free area for swimming - the ride to the resort be long -lrb- 1 hour -rrb- but you get to go through some of they small town and they farm and see how its like - the show be ok .<ssssss>i have be to other resort where they be really creative , so this seem mediocre in comparison .<ssssss>but the animation staff work crazy hour , so you have to at least admire they for they hard workthe bad - service be not very good at all .<ssssss>i have have service at 2 * hotel in canada where they be 10x more attentive - i do not like how you would not know the hour of the buffet - the guy that be book the a la carte restaurant be too busy flirt with girl to do he job efficiently .<ssssss>when we go to complain to the concierge , the manager -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>be extremely rude and offensive - even after my vacation , i have no idea where to get fresh towel - on saturday evening , they open up the resort to the dominican public .<ssssss>they have a beach party , and it be great to see the energy and the show .<ssssss>however , a lot of those people be very rude and keep try to steal we towel - on that night , the bar close up early !<ssssss>even if you have you wristband , you could not get drink -lrb- and it be state that there would be 24h drink ! -rrb-<ssssss>- the restaurant staff be not very attentive at the buffet : it take they forever to fill we glass with water and to clear off we use plate - at the disco , some of the staff would try to dance with girl - they do not seem to understand no and this make it very uncomfortable - the bar at the disco be a cash bar - i do get some mosquito/bug bite -lrb- ~ 10 -rrb- , so depend on you itching tolerance , beware - if you do not speak spanish , you have a tough time get help or get answer - the flea market that border the hotel property sometimes name outrageous price .<ssssss>as much as i want to help the local economy , i be shock when they suggest that 6 wooden necklace would cost I $ 105 usd - ridiculous !<ssssss>- we be delay at the airport , so we have to eat there .<ssssss>like all airport , the price they be charge for food be ridiculous , so make sure you bring water from you hotel with you while you wait for you flight<ssssss>

3 -1 2 4 5 5 5 -1		clean and friendly , but ... i stay at this hotel for two night from dec , 31st 2007 until jan , 2nd 2008 .<ssssss>the hall be really nice and there be a nice smell all the time - like some sort of candle or something.check in be easy and quick .<ssssss>they give I two queen size bed although a king size be guarantee - but i do not really care about that .<ssssss>-lrb- just a observation -rrb- .<ssssss>one thing i find a bit strange be , that they want to look into my bag before they would let I check-in .<ssssss>.<ssssss>probably that be because of new year 's eve ?!<ssssss>the room be clean and spacious , but : my room be on the ninth floor and face a big street and hence pretty loud .<ssssss>i could also hear people talk in the room next to I .<ssssss>i go to the reception and they give I a room on the 22nd floor which be quiet , but the fan in the bathroom be run and could not be switch off , so i decide to stay in my room on the 9th floor , although they tell I that i could change room the next morning , because they be ` kind of ' sell out .<ssssss>i decide not to change room , because actually i be too lazy and i be there for only two night .<ssssss>after the second night i wake up at about 8.30 a.m. hear door slam , people talk and again the noise from the street .<ssssss>another thing i have to mention -lrb- someone mention it before as well -rrb- : the pillow : they be not very comportable ... they be to high and at some point i just sleep on the mattress without a pillow .<ssssss>the mattress be - unfortunately - not as comfortable as it should be ... i be very thin , but when i get up in the morning you could see where exactly i be lie and i guess you can imagine that it be not very comfortable during the night either.i be surprise that they do not offer free internet .<ssssss>you obviously have to pay for the internet in the room , you also have to pay , i think , $ 3 or 5 to use the internet in the business lounge for 15 minute .<ssssss>there be just 3 computer in there and it be occupy everytime i go by .<ssssss>i guess for $ 199 and more per night i can assume that there be free internet available .<ssssss>but the good point : the hotel be just one block away from some subway station and with a express train it just take about 5 minute to wall street - financial disctrict - and 15 minute to midtown - time square.everybody in the hotel be very nice and try to help as much as possible .<ssssss>about 2 minute awaw from the hotel you have a burger king and a wendy 's and about 5 minute there be a drug store.unfortunately i have no chance to get that great look over manhattan .<ssssss>they tell you on the homepage that you have a great view from the concierge lounge , but the concierge lounge be only for -lrb- as far as i remember -rrb- for platinum marriott member .<ssssss>instead i walk to the brooklyn bridge and to manhattan - which just take about 25 minute - if you be not take picture like crazy like i be ; -rrb- to sum it up : the location be good , the room clean , spacious and the staff be friendly and helpful .<ssssss>if you be more or less just sleep there and sleep not longer than 8 .<ssssss>am or 8.30 be and have a deep slepp i can definately recommend it ; -rrb-<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 3 4 5 3		better than expect we first night 's stay be provide by a cruise line and rather than change hotel we simply extend we stay to four day .<ssssss>initially we be assign a smoking room on the 12th floor .<ssssss>the hotel have limit non smoking room and change room create a few difficulty .<ssssss>my only language be english but find this present no problem .<ssssss>both the smoking room and the non smoking room be identical .<ssssss>they be about the size of a average we motel room .<ssssss>amenity include all the usual plus a safe , scale , hair dryer , and a mini bar with a kettle .<ssssss>the closet be minimal size .<ssssss>the hotel be recently update with one exception , the carpet .<ssssss>both room and all carpet area throughout the hotel , include the elevator , need recarpeting or a good steam at the very least .<ssssss>if you can overlook they the rest of the hotel decor be quite nice although it would be nice to have a few chair in the large lobby .<ssssss>the location be not particularly good for the tourist as the hotel be some distance from the city center .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
1 2 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		not worth the review i see obviously i know from the start that the resort could not be a true 5 star with so many room , but the review be so nice that i be convinced.no turn down service , no place for child to play , the kid club have no material , not attractive at all , we never leave we 8 year old child there.everytime we ask for something to a staff , the answer be no .<ssssss>i thing it lack middle management supervision .<ssssss>the excursion be too expensive and disappointing .<ssssss>-lrb- cuba or brazil be much better in that respect -rrb- .<ssssss>the main restaurant be impressive to start with , but then very repetitive.the duche vichy at the spa be bad , basically there be no massage .<ssssss>on the good side , cleaning be ok , the building and the room space be fine , beach be very nice , pool be big , however i would not recommend .<ssssss>
4 5 3 4 3 4 2 5		great pool the front desk be very nice , a bit hard to understand if you call for direction .<ssssss>i be only there for a day and a half but i wish i could stay longer .<ssssss>the room be basic but the view make up for it and it be definitely nice to dip in the very large and clean pool .<ssssss>the towel rack be empty both time i go to the pool , but i bring my own , that be fine .<ssssss>i let it dry on the beautiful balcony .<ssssss>i never see breakfast , sleep in ... .<ssssss>and the parking be valet , but they be all great .<ssssss>i read another review where the bartender be not nice and i have the same experience when the local be in there , i do not feel welcome .<ssssss>hopefully he get a different job.the japanese little place , i do try , but it be expensive and i really do not like it .<ssssss>i should have try the bar food .<ssssss>just not enough time !<ssssss>i almost stay somewhere else for this trip but i be give it another try because the price be right and the pool really be great .<ssssss>
4 2 4 4 4 3 4 5		nice overall , but no great value we stay for a extended weekend as part of a conference/vacation .<ssssss>the pool and grounds be lovely , and the room clean and pleasant -lrb- if a little small -rrb- .<ssssss>we be treat well by the staff overall , though some be a little young and inattentive .<ssssss>the pool be gorgeous -- great for kid who enjoy swimming .<ssssss>the beach be lovely as well , and security be quite good .<ssssss>we feel that we could relax and enjoy we time there .<ssssss>we only eat at the restaurant near the beach .<ssssss>the snack be overprice and only so-so , though the meal be pretty good and not too expensive .<ssssss>the drink be expensive and weak , and even the bottled water and soda be overprice .<ssssss>once the conference end , we feel a bit isolate from shopping -- the shelf at the store across the street be 1/2 empty , and there be only a few fastfood place otherwise .<ssssss>i would recommend go 2 block , past the sj hotel and casino , to gelato piu for meal and snack .<ssssss>

2 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		not impress at all .<ssssss>the reason we stay at this hotel be the price and location .<ssssss>we want something for a bachelor party that be very close to bourbon that have a good price .<ssssss>this hotel meet both criteria.overall i be not very impressed at all with this hotel .<ssssss>the look of the hotel be very modern and nice so i figure it would be a lot better .<ssssss>we have a 3 double room and they be all average size .<ssssss>the bed be very soft but not that uncomfortable .<ssssss>they have a huge tv center that have you tv , mirror , desk and 2 closet .<ssssss>the bathroom be a nice size but the shower head be horrible.i be not tall at all , 5 ' 9 , but the head be place at about 5 ' high on the wall so i have to lean over to wash my hair .<ssssss>it be a real pain in the butt .<ssssss>also the pedestal sink be break and the bowl on the top be close to fall off .<ssssss>with the pedestal sink there be no counter but a shelf that be about 6 wide and run the length of the bathroom so if you have a lot to spread out it will be hard .<ssssss>another bathroom problem be in a friend room the toilet seat cover be not even attach to the toilet so it just fall off on the floor.we check in at about 11pm and the guy that check we in be not very friendly at all .<ssssss>first he stare at we stand at the door to get in like we be try to rob the place with all we luggage in tow .<ssssss>after he let we in i do not think he say more then 2 word the whole time .<ssssss>it be the same thing when we check out .<ssssss>not very friendly at all and do not talk.one night i have forget my key in the room so i have to get a replacement and that guy be not even friendly .<ssssss>it be a inconvenience for he to get off the cell phone and do he job .<ssssss>plus after i get the key and think about it he never check my od to make sure it be my room.the biggest thing that make I mad be after i get home and look at the bill closer there be a 1.95 a day charge for a safe warranty .<ssssss>i do not even know there be a safe in the room !<ssssss>no one say a word to I about a safe.i be do with the royal st. charle and i suggest if there be another choice for a few $ more go ahead and take it .<ssssss>i would suggest the hampton inn on carondolet .<ssssss>we stay there a few year ago and it be fantastic .<ssssss>
3 4 3 5 2 3 3 -1		could be cleaner ; but great to have a kitchen the location of this hotel be difficult to beat -- right in the rock , a stone 's throw from the harbor .<ssssss>and the price be moderate -lrb- au $ 189 for a twin in april , 2007 -rrb- .<ssssss>while the room and pool could have be cleaner -lrb- the blanket definitely need to be wash , but the sheet be clean -rrb- , we very much like have a kitchen .<ssssss>and do not pay rack rate .<ssssss>check wotif.com to see what deal be available .<ssssss>this hotel could be very nice with some investment , but then it would probably be expensive .<ssssss>
3 2 4 2 3 4 4 -1		ok but not great we just return from barcelona and the hispano 7 suiza .<ssssss>from other review we think it would be a quite elegant and posh accommodation but it be not .<ssssss>the hallway for example have dirty look wall like in a 2 star hotel .<ssssss>the apartment itself be nicely decorate though .<ssssss>we have the so call royal suite at the top floor so we do not hear much noise from other people .<ssssss>the view from the large balcony be not nice though .<ssssss>many rundown apartment building .<ssssss>the bar area of the hotel be always desert .<ssssss>it be a long and narrow room which overall have no nice and comfortable feel to it .<ssssss>the breakfast room have a very high ceiling and be bright but have no outside window .<ssssss>although non smoking smoke come in from a adjacent room .<ssssss>the breakfast selection be quite good for spanish standard .<ssssss>the thing we really do not like about the hispano be the area the hotel be in .<ssssss>the hispano be situate on the edge of the eixample district .<ssssss>although the eixample be a very nice upscale area close to the sagrada familia it get more and more boring , nothing upscale any more .<ssssss>many ugly newer apartment building line the street , only very few of those nice modernist building the eixample be famous for .<ssssss>next time i wood definately stay closer to passeig gracia .<ssssss>it be nice to see the sagrada at night when return to the hotel though .<ssssss>staff at the hispano 7 suiza be always friendly .<ssssss>

5 5 2 5 4 5 5 4		charming hotel , enhance by superior service by staff we select el convento , with no prior knowledge of puerto rico or the hotel , use trip advisor ... and we be very well advise indeed .<ssssss>the hotel be not a beach resort .<ssssss>it be wonderfully located in the most historic part of old san juan .<ssssss>the location across from the cathedral and very near to the primary shopping area allow for walk nearly everywhere in the old city -- the museum , restaurant , historic building and waterfront .<ssssss>there be a free shuttle bus loop should you tire of walk , or want to begin you day at the far end of town.the hotel be a historic building begin in the 17th century , and be one of the early historic preservation effort in the old town when it be convert from commercial use to hotel in the 1960 by a member of the woolworth family .<ssssss>today it have just over 50 room , plus a lovely terrace and plunge pool on the roof with harbor and town view , a nice gathering area where wine and cheese be generously serve each evening , restaurant and meeting facility .<ssssss>we room be not large , but we have access to so many other facility -- include nice table in the open air hallway of the hotel -- that it do not much matter .<ssssss>the bathroom be also quite small , as be often the case with historic hotel .<ssssss>if you be look for space , this be not the place for you .<ssssss>the furniture be date , but the room be clean and have door that open to a harbor view .<ssssss>there be a up-to-date flat screen tv and complimentary hard-wire internet access -lrb- as well as a computer in the library for those not travel with they own -rrb- .<ssssss>linen be clean , and towel be promptly replace during turn down service .<ssssss>air conditioning be just adequate , and would definitely be a concern in warmer month .<ssssss>the hotel building and furnishings be comfortable , not lavish , but the staff be exceptional .<ssssss>the evening wine reception be truly a chance to meet and interact with staff and other guest , not the usual one glass of cheap wine and run .<ssssss>we enjoy we fellow traveler and talk with staff , and we get lot of pointer on restaurant and thing to do .<ssssss>judith , the front desk manager who be originally from sweden but have 17 year in puerto rico , be particularly welcome as well as wonderfully efficient .<ssssss>she and the entire staff team never fail to be welcome , courteous and helpful .<ssssss>that put the real luxury into the stay.there be access to a beach club at isla verde , which be actually the marriott courtyard hotel , adjacent to the airport .<ssssss>this require a $ 20 + tip taxi ride each way , but once there we be treat very well and the beach be superb .<ssssss>you can sign for food expense at the marriott that be bill back to you el convento account , so you need not carry much money or credit card for you time on the beach.we dine twice at the in-house tapa restaurant , a nice follow-up to the healthy serve of cheese at the wine reception .<ssssss>breakfast in the courtyard be very good with good service , but the morning kitchen be very slow .<ssssss>we 5 night stay be at rack rate in high season , so it be not inexpensive .<ssssss>the hotel be use by cruise line for pre-departure stay , and some traveler report much-discounted room rate ... but only for one night .<ssssss>we feel that we receive good value due to location , historic ambience and the very special treatment give by all of the staff .<ssssss>if you want a beach resort , or the most up to date interior design , el convento be not for you .<ssssss>if you want to be in old san juan with easy access to cultural site and wonderful dining , and with a atmosphere that reflect a very historic place very well , then select el convento .<ssssss>we be very glad that we do .<ssssss>

when we check in , we first room have a bathroom ceiling that be nearly cave in , a crack tub , a patio door with no lock whatsoever , and even though we request -lrb- and the front desk staff state we have -rrb- a non smoking room , it reek of smoke .<ssssss>we politely ask if we could change room , but the resort be full that night , so the very helpful manager assure we we would have a new room the next day and true to he word , we did.sadly , this room be better , but not much better .<ssssss>at least it do not reek of smoke -lrb- a major issue for I , i have allergy -rrb- , but it have a thermostat that be literally miss , with nothing but expose wire where it should have be .<ssssss>honest , i have a picture of it .<ssssss>the ceiling fan and the bathroom light be on all the time regardless of the position of the light switch , and the linen be terribly worn .<ssssss>in addition , all of we party and 5 or 6 other party we talk to have the same issue with they room : - little or no air conditioning .<ssssss>- the bed and pillow be rock hard .<ssssss>- each room seem to have 5 or 6 maintenance issue .<ssssss>tv not work , cracks/holes in wall , miss lamp shades with bare bulb , miss tile , leak plumbing , etc , etcbottom line be the room be tired and need update .<ssssss>nuff said.but this be a beach resort , so how be it outside the room ?<ssssss>great!pool / beach - the naiboa have the best pool and best bar of the whole riu complex !<ssssss>and people actually stay at the better riu resort , but use the pool and bar at the naiboa every day .<ssssss>we meet 4 party that admit to this because the pool be larger and the outdoor terrace/bar be fan-freaking-tastic .<ssssss>the beach be great , but stake out you spot early every morning .<ssssss>it get crowd .<ssssss>if you be interested in snorkeling , there be a reef just outside of the swim area .<ssssss>email I if you want detail .<ssssss>food/drink - the food be good , i would say it be on par with what i expect .<ssssss>one major issue : the resort advertise a italian restaurant in addition to the buffet restaurant .<ssssss>what they do not tell you be that this italian restaurant be share with another riu resort .<ssssss>you must make reservation to eat at the italian place and they start take reservation every morning at 7 am !<ssssss>each resort get 12 of the 24 table , so the place be book solid by 7:20 every day .<ssssss>start to take reservation at 7:00 be be just plain stupid and i have criticize other riu resort we have stay at for adhering to this ridiculous practice .<ssssss>who want to drag themselves out of bed at 7:00 be while they be on vacation ?<ssssss>bottom line be the vast majority of guest will only eat at the buffet .<ssssss>but that be not the end of the world .<ssssss>the buffet be good .<ssssss>i have have better , but i have certainly have much worse and , again , at much more expensive resort than this .<ssssss>atmosphere/people - i really enjoy the different nationality and american be definitely in the minority here .<ssssss>not that that be a bad thing , if i want to hang out with american i would stay home .<ssssss>do not be afraid to engage you fellow traveler in conversation .<ssssss>a couple of thing to be aware of .<ssssss>parent should understand that some european woman will be topless at the beach and pool .<ssssss>also , the resort staff will serve alcohol to anyone who look to be roughly 18 give or take a few year if you know what i mean .<ssssss>just so you know and plan accordingly.the resort seem to be popular with canadian bachelor party group .<ssssss>two group in particular become very drunk and repeatedly engage in lewd behavior with female member of they group .<ssssss>other people complain to the staff , and again to the staff 's credit , they put a stop to it .<ssssss>if you see inappropriate behavior , complain and the staff will take care of it.overall , i would rate the naiboa a 6 out of 10 .<ssssss>i would say it be a good value for family and those on a budget .<ssssss>just do not expect 4 star quality and flawless room .<ssssss>

3 4 3 4 5 5 5 3		good for budget , uncomfortable bed .<ssssss>sorry this be long so get a snack .<ssssss>i be really post neutral because this be the only hotel i have ever stay in tokyo , so nothing to compare with .<ssssss>i will say the staff be excellent !<ssssss>very helpful , speak english well -lrb- which i find be a rare find in the city -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be small by american standard but my friend in tokyo visit I and comment that my room be large for japanese standard almost with a wow tone .<ssssss>it be suitable for just I , however it would be nice if they supply some extra cabinet , shelf to organize stuff .<ssssss>the room could fit it .<ssssss>window be opaque , make I feel kind of like i be in a prison cell because i could not see out of it !<ssssss>although outside -lrb- you could slide top part open -rrb- be just a wall within arm reach.cleanliness : clean .<ssssss>period.bed : the bed be the worst ever !<ssssss>i read bad review on how uncomfortable the bed be but hey i be a young 115 pound gal , i use to sleep on a mattress you could probably roll into a tube , i have a good back , this do not concern I .<ssssss>oh my .<ssssss>i be ready to check out the next day .<ssssss>after pound the pavement for hour then try to sleep on that ?<ssssss>thin , springy , wavy , uneven .<ssssss>i almost sleep on the floor which be like a cement slab .<ssssss>luckily i find that take the two blanket and folding to the width of my body -lrb- 1/2 the bed -rrb- to make they about 2 inch thick and just sleep on that make the bed more firm and ultimately sleepable .<ssssss>i actually turn away housekeeping for 2 day so they would not mess up my new bed and i would have to remake it .<ssssss>haha .<ssssss>finally i need new sheet and take down the do not disturb .<ssssss>and to my delight , they keep my makeshift blanket bed !!!!<ssssss>haha .<ssssss>this must have be something they have see before.moral of the story - if you have a bad back , or just cherish a good night sleep , axe this place .<ssssss>or get the japanese style room .<ssssss>seriously , i walk by a japanese style room and think that floor mat look like a cloud of joy .<ssssss>location : the location be good .<ssssss>everyone keep talk about how it be far from ueno station .<ssssss>uh yeah , that be why they have a the inaricho station right there !!<ssssss>i never walk to ueno ?<ssssss>first of all , ueno be a madhouse , inaricho be quick and convenient .<ssssss>the ginza line be great and take you anywhere you need to go .<ssssss>if i ever transfer line it be only once and very rare .<ssssss>i even get on inaricho to go to ueno station .<ssssss>seriously , do not walk more than you have too.the distance to asakusa be nice too -lrb- about same as ueno station -rrb- .<ssssss>you can even get off one stop up -lrb- tawaramachi -rrb- and find shopping , restaurant , etc. right outside the hotel there be not much.patrons : the hotel be quiet generally .<ssssss>i think they get a good clientele .<ssssss>but beware because of the low rate you will not be exempt of trash that may enter .<ssssss>toward the end of the week a big group of guy check in .<ssssss>that night at 2 - 3 be they be run through the hall pound on door .<ssssss>yell stuff that be not in english so i have no idea what be go on .<ssssss>danger ?<ssssss>fire ?<ssssss>terrorist attack ?<ssssss>i seriously freak out but manage to fall back to sleep .<ssssss>when i wake up next am and see some trash dude sleep in the hallway , yuck .<ssssss>i chock it up to a bunch of drunk fools.internet : be a bonus .<ssssss>at least i definately need internet access because there be no communication to the usa otherwise .<ssssss>all tv station be in japanese , etc. typically the computer be all be use in the morning and early evening .<ssssss>but most of the time you could get on .<ssssss>i think one of the drunk guy break one .<ssssss>so end of the week we be down 3 computer to 2 .<ssssss>all in all , i will not stay here again but it be a good option if you just want to save money .<ssssss>next time i will probably have a companion and can split the cost , that way i will upgrade .<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 5 3 2 -1		major convenience but not much else staff be not very welcome .<ssssss>as mention by other , this isone of the smallest room i have ever book .<ssssss>the bathroom door literally hit the toilet anytime we enter the bathroom.however -- the hotel look great when you have 5am check in for a international flight and just have towalk down the concourse to get there .<ssssss>
3 2 3 1 3 1 1 1		get a good rate or go elsewhere the room be nice and this hotel be acceptable as long as you get a really good rate .<ssssss>i do not get my wake up call and my message never arrive , a issue with food make my guest sick and the pool be close and due to open the day after i leave with no consideration to allow entry the day before .<ssssss>it be a bit of a way from ` the action ' of lkf/central and wanchai but the mtr be great .<ssssss>the supermarket opposite be a god send and there be some eatery for breakkie nearby .<ssssss>only if you get a good rate - try anything but definately do not pay rack rate - much better hotel closer to central .<ssssss>g<ssssss>

1 1 -1 5 -1 2 -1 -1		worst singapore experience i stay 7 night at excelsior tower superior room and 3 night at the peninsular tower deluxe room .<ssssss>apart from the location there be nothing good about this hotel and its staff .<ssssss>the carpet and quilt smell like rotten fish .<ssssss>the in-room safe didnâ€™t work .<ssssss>the toilet look like a garden of fungus and mould .<ssssss>grout keep fall from the wall tile .<ssssss>water from the wash basin come like that of a shower head and the shower water come exactly like a basin faucet .<ssssss>mix a humanly tolerable amount of hot water to the shower be impossible .<ssssss>they say the maximum amount for in-room wire internet usage per 24 hour be $ 20 .<ssssss>however on check out i be bill $ 37 for the first day .<ssssss>the casher have no idea why !<ssssss>she keep say that some other company be responsible for internet billing .<ssssss>so please avoid this place at any cost .<ssssss>if you prefer this location just book the grand plaza park royal which be opposite peninsular excelsior .<ssssss>
2 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		be careful what you ask for !<ssssss>i -lrb- 58 -rrb- stay here with my girlfriend -lrb- 26 -rrb- for 10 day and overall find the experience adequate .<ssssss>the food be average at best but plentiful .<ssssss>my girlfriend have some problem with taino 's revenge while there and i do upon return but nothing that stop we activity .<ssssss>the room we get be better than average because of a little chat with the lady check we in and a 20 $ bill fold up discreetly and pass to she .<ssssss>leave a couple of dollar each day on the bed for the maid and the same in the mini-bar and you service will be quite nice .<ssssss>anything not include in the all-inclusive price at the resort be likely to be quite expensive .<ssssss>the shop be absolutely outrageously expensive -lrb- $ 15.00 usd for 10 tampon $ 50.00 for flip flop and sunglass -rrb- and you really have no choice so make sure you bring everything or take a taxi outside and buy thing -lrb- you will still save money but make sure you bargain for everything -rrb- .<ssssss>take the jurassic tour and have a great time and good value for money as be the snorkeling and crazy wheel -lrb- atv 's -rrb- .<ssssss>the express train when it run be convenient but often very crowd .<ssssss>i think the place represent good value for money if you understand exactly what you be get .<ssssss>large number of hispanic tourist with family can be a bit of a nuisance but just get use to have less personal space than normal .<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 4 2 3 -1		beautiful beach , uneven amenity on the whole , we have a pleasant stay at ifa bavaro village .<ssssss>we like the casual , informal atmosphere .<ssssss>we room be spacious and clean .<ssssss>extremely lumpy pillow , erratic a/c , dim lighting -lrb- not one but two mystery switch that control nothing we could identify -rrb- , and a balky patio door detract from the overall comfort of we room .<ssssss>the staff be sweet and good with we kid , the beach and pool be wonderful , and we appreciate the casual buffet-style dining .<ssssss>as for dining here , i can not fairly judge the overall quality of the food , because we be vegetarian and often find it challenge to put together a balanced meal from the offering .<ssssss>hot vegetable , pasta , potato , and rice dish be more often than not make with meat -lrb- we omniverous companion fare better -rrb- .<ssssss>the specialty restaurant might have be better , but since we be a large group we opt to stick with the buffet as get reservation seem problematic .<ssssss>wait staff be very nice .<ssssss>other annoyance : no decaf , few whole grain , vague or misleading sign on the buffet .<ssssss>beware eating here if you have severe food allergy , unless you speak flawless spanish !<ssssss>wonderful fresh fruit , exotic yogurt flavor , and hot chocolate at breakfast , beachside crepe at lunch.resort wide , there be several issue that we have trouble with .<ssssss>we have ask for two adjoining room -lrb- small kid involve -rrb- but be give room across the hall .<ssssss>we be tell nothing could be do about this until mid-stay , when the trouble of packing and move would make it not worthwhile to move .<ssssss>they only give you one room key , regardless of how many occupant of the room .<ssssss>there be also no directory of phone number , service , or even a map of the resort ; you literally have to blunder around to find thing .<ssssss>we room be close to the beach but also close to one of the bar , and it be pretty loud at night.if you go here , please pledge not to litter on the gorgeous beach .<ssssss>it be heartbreak to see the discard cup and straw all over at the end of the day .<ssssss>pick up after yourself .<ssssss>
5 5 5 4 5 5 5 2		very decent hotel .<ssssss>hotel from outside<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		okay room , horrible restaurant ... now we know why the mediterranean suite be so cheap .<ssssss>the room itself be nice enough -lrb- with a large bed , deep loveseat and chair , mediterranean-themed carpet and wall color , decent-size tv , etc. .<ssssss>. -rrb-<ssssss>, but the view from the terrace can be marginal -lrb- unless you like look down on alleyway , tin roof , and into other people 's apartment nearby -rrb- , and the air conditioning do not seem to work.oh , and the hotel do not have any fan .<ssssss>fortunately , there be a supermarket a half-block up las ramblas -lrb- on the same side of the street -rrb- , own by the carrefour consortium -lrb- which mean it be much like most any other major supermarket chain you might encounter in europe -rrb- .<ssssss>on the first floor , they have get fresh vegetable , drink , personal grooming product , electrical equipment -lrb- include fan -rrb- , etc. ... make sure to check you bag in at the front desk before you enter the store , and keep in mind that if you be go to use a shopping cart that the only way downstairs -lrb- to all the package food , dairy product , fresh meat and cheese , etc. .<ssssss>. -rrb-<ssssss>will be the elevator on the right , and be not well marked unless you be look up at the sign above you head .<ssssss>otherwise , you will want to stick with a hand-basket and the escalator or stairs.the bed in this room be amazingly hard -- the hardest bed i think i have ever try to sleep on .<ssssss>i be not sure , but i may have have a softer bed at time in the past when i be camping , with my sleep bag on the ground .<ssssss>or when i be crash with friend , lay directly on a hard concrete floor with a thin layer of carpet .<ssssss>but my wife be absolutely in love with the pillow -- they give each of you a huge two foot by two foot back pillow , and a smaller pillow to use while sleep , and they be high quality down/feather .<ssssss>but why have a nice bathroom with lot of marble and mirror , if you be go to get a sewer stink ?<ssssss>we pass a sewer on las ramblas , so we know for sure what that smell be , we just can not be 100 % certain where it be come from in the bathroom .<ssssss>and why have just one bar of soap in the bathroom ?<ssssss>do not you want a large one in or near the bath/shower , and a smaller one near the sink ?<ssssss>after you have wash yourself in the shower with the large bath bar , do you want to use that same bar again to wash you hand or face in or over the sink?note that the shower be very powerful -lrb- enough to hurt , if you turn it on full strength -rrb- , and can get very , very hot -- think mcdonald 's coffee hot .<ssssss>i like hot shower , and i like long shower .<ssssss>i could only turn the handle very slightly past the halfway point before i feel like i be be scald .<ssssss>and the hot water never run out .<ssssss>the tub be also very deep , but be make out of plastic and be rather disconcert to feel it move underneath my foot .<ssssss>i later decide that it be intentional to have the floor of the tub have a slight give to it , to make it feel a bit softer and more comfortable .<ssssss>it also have raise spot spread throughout , which i presume be intend to have some sort of massage effect on you foot .<ssssss>the electrical power in the room be also marginal -- we lose all power earlier today , but we be not sure if it be a breaker that flip or a result of the construction .<ssssss>we be leave at the time , so it do not really matter .<ssssss>but i would be very concerned if that kind of thing happen when we be go to be in the room for a while .<ssssss>tonight , we have notice that all the other light in the room will flicker when you turn on another electrical device.also note that most of the light in the room be compact fluorescent , which tend to give off a kind of greenish glow , and do not put out a lot of light .<ssssss>if you have seasonal affective disorder , or get depress at night if you have bad lighting , be warn .<ssssss>there be light on the terrace , and they can feel pretty bright at night.the light switch by the door control the power to the small halogen lamp in the ceiling near the door -lrb- over the desk -rrb- , but also control the power to the small halogen lamp in the alcove and the floor-standing halogen lamp in the bedroom .<ssssss>unfortunately , the floor-standing lamp be fairly weak -lrb- i be guess 100 watt or 150 watt , instead of the standard 300 watt -rrb- .<ssssss>it take we a while to figure out how to turn on the floor-standing lamp , and even have the engineer come up to take a look at it to see what need to be fixed.avoid room 627 at all possible cost .<ssssss>it be long and thin -lrb- and weirdly shape -rrb- , with a tiny breakfast/living area at one end , and a tiny bedroom area at the other -lrb- just barely large enough to contain the bed -rrb- .<ssssss>the air conditioning do work well , but it drip -- make sure you do not put anything underneath the vent on the ceiling in the hallway area.this room may have two tv -lrb- one in the living area and one in the bedroom area -rrb- , but the one in the bedroom area can not display any of the on-demand movie or other special content .<ssssss>you can get the small selection of satellite tv channel , and that be it.the one save grace of room 627 be that it have a much larger and nicer terrace than any of the other mediterranean suite , with view of three side of the hotel .<ssssss>the other suite on the sixth floor look out mostly onto other nearby buildings.as far as the food be concern , the room service menu be very minimal .<ssssss>the soup have be good , the single-serving size margarita -lrb- only cheese , no sauce or other topping -rrb- pizza be hand-tossed thin-crust style -lrb- which my wife like but i do not -rrb- , the club sandwich be very good , the chicken with green tagliatelle pasta be okay.but whatever you do , do * not * eat dinner in the restaurant downstairs .<ssssss>it look nice enough , the dinner be buffet-style -lrb- which my wife and i think we would appreciate -rrb- , but the food itself be marginal at best .<ssssss>it take I a long time to figure out when i last have cafeteria style food that be worse -- i have to go back to school lunch that i have in sixth grade , and even some of they be better .<ssssss>and the restaurant downstairs be euro-style expensive , with dinner for one person run something like 30 euros.the bar look nice , and they be suppose to have live entertainment tuesday through saturday .<ssssss>we have not actually do anything there , but i think it would be hard to screw that up too badly.if you room be on the fifth floor or below , you have two elevator to choose from .<ssssss>if you be on the sixth floor or above , there be only one elevator , which be apparently also share with the staff .<ssssss>you can get three people in one of these elevator , but that can be a tight fit .<ssssss>
2 3 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		could not get out quick enough .<ssssss>i book out the same day i arrive .<ssssss>it cost I $ 100 .<ssssss>no fridge or cofeemaker in room .<ssssss>beverage in the reception must be pay for .<ssssss>hotel all no smoking .<ssssss>when my partner ask if there be a rear outside smoking area the desk clerk scream outside outside and pointed to the front door .<ssssss>problem be , there be a male strip club almost next door .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 4 2 3		disappointing !<ssssss>on the face of it the komaneka look great !<ssssss>however we stay for 10 night and it become apparent that the hotel could not maintain the level of service that you would expect from a 5 * hotel .<ssssss>e.g. late turndown , cleaning of the room not do until the afternoon poor trip offer by the hotel that represent bad value for money!the last irritation be the fact that when we come to pay we final bill we be tell we could not pay in we dollar with a mastercard but only in rupiah this add approx .<ssssss>Â£100 + to we bill owe to the exchange rate .<ssssss>if you do stay here please take a visa card so that this do not happen to you.the komaneka be certainly nice and staff be polite however compare to some of the small boutique resort we have stay at in thailand it be lag behind !<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 2 3 1		a disappointment i stay at the park plaza for a conference .<ssssss>base on the hotel 's website , where it say that president and world leader stay there , i expect it to be luxurious and highly service orient .<ssssss>instead , it be a worn old hotel with a low commitment to customer service .<ssssss>here be some problem with my room .<ssssss>-- occasional sewagey smell in bathroom -- broken heater -lrb- heater would not turn on , then after it be fix would not turn off -rrb- -- old tv with remote that do not work -- shower with water pressure that increase and decrease at random -- shower that get hotter and colder at random -- tiny bathroom with bad design - it be hard to wash my face without bump my head on the shelf that stick out above the sink -- broken hair dryer -- scratchy towel -- hair on bed when i arrive -- filthy mirror -- no free wi-fus -lrb- they have free wi-fus even at the holiday inn -rrb- and the business center be not free either .<ssssss>it require a $ 10 payment to go online for 30 minute .<ssssss>-- very long wait time when i call to get some of these problem addressedin addition , the hotel could have be very charming if it have be properly restore or renovate .<ssssss>but instead there be 80-year-old tile in the bathroom and it look just a little dilapidated in general .<ssssss>i stay a doubletree in february which be cheaper and way nicer .<ssssss>the neighborhood be wonderful though .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 3 2 4 -1		perfect for lilliputian i be in seattle for a conference in june and spend three night here .<ssssss>the room be a double , ie , two bed and i be travel with my spouse .<ssssss>there be not enough room for we to unpack anything and so little floor space that i could not leave my suitcase fill and accessible -lrb- not even under the bed -rrb- .<ssssss>i contact the front desk for additional hanger so that i could at least hang my thing .<ssssss>i be a light packer but be completely stymie by the inability to put my thing away .<ssssss>the bathroom be the smallest i have ever use .<ssssss>the stall shower be not large enough to bend elbow much less shave leg , etc. plus , the shower curtain be black and so there be no light in the stall .<ssssss>sink be like a airplane sink .<ssssss>ridiculously small .<ssssss>do not attempt to wash you face use such a fixture .<ssssss>plus it be in you lap when you sit down on the toilet .<ssssss>staff be friendly and courteous but nothing could compensate for the size of the facility .<ssssss>great location , comfortable bed but i will never go back .<ssssss>
2 1 1 5 3 4 3 3		not impressed we stay 4 night in beautiful san francisco in april 2007 .<ssssss>we be schedule to stay at the cancellor hotel for the entire trip .<ssssss>however , we decide to only stay for 1 night .<ssssss>the room be terribly small for the rate .<ssssss>in this case , we be basically pay for the location .<ssssss>they website be much nicer than the reality .<ssssss>the best thing about the hotel be the cookie at the front desk .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 2 2 -1		good location , bad aura .<ssssss>lobby on the 1st floor<ssssss>
4 5 5 5 2 5 5 4		great place , a few minor hiccup hotel porta faenza be situate right in the heart of florence , walkable to all the major attraction of the city as well as the train station .<ssssss>however , it be a bit tricky to find as you have to understand the utterly bizarre numbering system for street address in florence -lrb- business in black , home in red , or the other way around , i forget â€?and two unrelated set of number , google map even put it in the wrong place -rrb- â€?and we find the wrong # 77 and have to call the hotel to be redirect .<ssssss>however , this wasnâ€™t a very big deal and once we get there we be very pleased with the superb staff -lrb- exceptionally good english speaker , very we tourist friendly -rrb- who help we immensely as we get orient to the city .<ssssss>the room be very clean , very cozy and nicely decorate â€?oh , and internet access be free , a rare treat .<ssssss>the bathroom be lovely as well , though the water , it seem , be â€œhard water , â€?with a bit of a sulfuric smell .<ssssss>it wasnâ€™t overwhelming , but if youâ€™re sensitive to that , itâ€™s certainly noticeable/worth mention .<ssssss>the other problem be that the shower be small and leaky and i realize too late that it cause I to flood the bathroom !<ssssss>we soak up the water with we remain towel , and go about we day .<ssssss>we be bum out when we come back and see that no one have clean the room !<ssssss>we call the front desk and ask for more towel -lrb- the bathroom be dry by now but we have no towel leave -rrb- â€?and they gladly bring they and seem very surprised and distressed that we room have not be service , so i canâ€™t imagine this be a regular occurrence .<ssssss>we be only there the two night , so iâ€™m sure they would have take care of it the next day if we have be stay longer .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be generous and delicious .<ssssss>overall we have a great time in florence and enjoy we stay at the hotel porta faenza , despite the hiccup which i can only imagine be the product of a relatively new hotel -lrb- i think ?? -rrb-<ssssss>get the kink work out .<ssssss>all that say , iâ€™d still recommend it pretty highly if youâ€™re look for a reasonably price place to stay thatâ€™s in the center of everything , and have the feel , if not the finesse , of a higher-priced place .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 2 3 3 5		not quite there the title of my review basically sum up we recent stay at the andra .<ssssss>overall , we be satisfy with we stay , as we get a deep discount , but i be left wonder how or why they be list with small luxury hotel of the world.we have a lux king corner suite , and the suite itself be quite spacious , and very quiet , we do have a restful sleep .<ssssss>beds/linens be soft and comfortable , and they bring up extra pillow as request .<ssssss>there be plenty of storage in we suite -- 2 closet and a set of drawer , plus the generously-sized night table be a plus.however , the sofa be disappointing -- of cheap construction , and sag in the middle ; fairly uncomfortable to sit on to watch tv .<ssssss>the armchair seriously need recover , as the edge be wear , dirty and fray .<ssssss>the suite be due for a overhaul soon ; we notice chip paint throughout , plus chip and scratch furniture .<ssssss>the carpet feel a bit grimy -- there be a overall feeling that the room could have be cleaner.the bathroom be small -lrb- i know this go in , have read past review -rrb- .<ssssss>this do not bother I much , as there be adequate shelf and storage .<ssssss>however , if you like soak in the tub , forget it .<ssssss>the tub have a very low overflow drain , obviously design by someone who hate bath .<ssssss>i be 5 ' 2 and not very big -- the maximum water level come up to my lower abdomen .<ssssss>as i recline try to soak , the water keep drain off , and i give up after about 5 minute .<ssssss>shower pressure be good and ton of hot water any time of the day .<ssssss>the face stockholm amenity be a delicious subtle white tea fragrance ; however the bottle be the size of postage stamp , which seem cheap for a luxury hotel .<ssssss>the staff be happy to send up more , but it be tire to request this on a daily basis.the staff be mostly 20-30 something and very pleasant and eager to please .<ssssss>however , i still feel they have not achieve a luxury level of service .<ssssss>we have a simple request that we be send a seattle time , v. a new york time as we like to read local news .<ssssss>on a daily basis we receive a new york time , which to give they credit , be swiftly replace with a seattle time on request , but we should not have have to keep ask for 4 day in a row .<ssssss>another time we ask a desk person to reconfirm a reservation -lrb- the concierge have leave -rrb- and he look at we like we hand he a dead fish .<ssssss>it may seem that i be nitpick , but i would expect this from maybe a motel 6 v. a luxury hotel .<ssssss>i would actually place the andra slightly above a 3 star hotel , not at a luxury level .<ssssss>the staff for the most part , be accomodate and pleasant , and the room be ok .<ssssss>we would stay again if we get the same low rate ; however , we would not stay if we have to pay the high season rate of approx $ 480.00 -- we feel the service and room would not be worth it .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 1 1 1 2		worst .<ssssss>experience .<ssssss>ever .<ssssss>what a horrible experience .<ssssss>so bad , in fact , that when i get back home , i write a 3-page letter to the management describe all of the problem and frustration i encounter at the hotel ... and i cc would starwood corporate office .<ssssss>starwood immediately respond , but the hotel do not .<ssssss>after several more attempt to reach the hotel management , they finally call I back at my office , but i be unavailable .<ssssss>they do not leave a message and never call back .<ssssss>this be typical of my stay .<ssssss>it start when they put I in a room that be already occupy and i walk in on a woman get dress .<ssssss>then there be construction noise , a staff that do not take much interest in they work , and the list go on .<ssssss>the hotel be in a great location , but i would go out of my way to find any place other than this hotel .<ssssss>you will spend all of you time on the phone with the front desk try to get thing the housekeeping staff do not stock the first time -lrb- have to call for towel , have to call for coffee supplies ... there be quite a long list -rrb- .<ssssss>on several day there be no hot water .<ssssss>and the management do not bother to warn we inadvance that there would be a lot of construction and noise -lrb- even on sunday -rrb- .<ssssss>if i be run the hotel and my front desk have already get half a dozen call from the same room , i would have alert the staff that we be fail this guest and ask they to step it up a bit .<ssssss>but that be not the case , the service just get worse the longer i stay -lrb- i be there for 5 day -rrb- .<ssssss>the hallway be never clean , glass sit outside of door for day .<ssssss>it be horrible all the way around .<ssssss>i like westin , but this one in no way live up to the westin name .<ssssss>stay any place else .<ssssss>and it seem the management will not really care anyway .<ssssss>
4 5 5 5 5 3 3 -1		great place to stay but not perfect four of we stay at this hotel for a girly week away 5-12 jan. the hotel itself be great .<ssssss>it be in a quieter part of town so it be possible to get a good night 's sleep after a day of shopping and sightseeing and all the major attraction be within easy walk distance .<ssssss>have see time square at night , we be very glad that we have not book a hotel in that area give the level of noise -lrb- new yorker like to use they car horn all day and all night !! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i book the room directly through the hotel website and request a quiet room on a high floor with a view and that be exactly what we get .<ssssss>we be in room 3206 with a view of the east river and downtown manhattan .<ssssss>it be lovely to watch the sun rise over the east river in a morning .<ssssss>the room itself be very spacious and the kitchen be very handy as we sort we own breakfast out every day .<ssssss>other reviewer have remark that the bathroom be small but we do not think so and there be four woman to accomodate!my only issue with the hotel be the level of service which be quite poor when compare to other 4 star hotel i have stay in .<ssssss>all of the staff be very pleasant and have plenty of advice .<ssssss>however , prior to arrival , i have request hypo-allergenic pillow as one of the traveller have a feather allergy .<ssssss>however , once in we room , we discover that both the pillow and duvet be duck down .<ssssss>this be just plain annoying and take about 3 phone call to reception to sort out , we also only have 3 towel when they be four of we - again only a little thing but something which a four star hotel should pick up on .<ssssss>however , i have to say that the housekeeping staff do ensure for the rest of we stay that this be correct and we room be always spotless.we find that we be have to contact reception a number of time about the same issue when the problem should have be sort out after the first call .<ssssss>quite often , i get the impression that the reception be too busy.there be plenty of place to eat near the hotel .<ssssss>if you go out of the hotel and turn right , we eat at blokhead -lrb- mexican -rrb- , cinema cafe and penelope 's -lrb- italian -rrb- .<ssssss>the food be very good and cheap .<ssssss>we favourite be penelope 's which do fantastic pizza .<ssssss>duane read 's which be opposite the hotel be great for provision .<ssssss>its a pharmacy but basically sell everything .<ssssss>we get cereal and milk etc from here and its much cheaper than the deli on the corner.we also go to a steak restaurant which have be recommend to I by a friend - smith and wollensky - near grand central station which be fantastic .<ssssss>if you be a fan of steak , then do not go anywhere else .<ssssss>the portion be huge and the steak cook to perfection .<ssssss>however , we go early on a monday night and by the time we be leave , the place be full .<ssssss>there be also a steak place on park ave nearer the hotel -lrb- call wolfgang 's steakhouse i think -rrb- which we be go to try but this be too busy on the night we went.we do all of the touristy thing and shopping and find that this be a perfect time of year to visit .<ssssss>a tip if you want to see a show - there be a discount ticket booth in the marriott hotel on time square - do not go there as its packed .<ssssss>there be another ticket office in downtown manhattan and we walk straight in and get we ticket for half price.one final tip - dont book you taxi to the airport through the hotel .<ssssss>we taxi from ne warkairport to the hotel be $ 71 plus toll and tip .<ssssss>i ask the hotel to book a return journey and be astounded that the company they recommend be charge $ 120 for a suv -lrb- we have a lot of luggage !!! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i then call a number which i find in my guidebook and they charge $ 69 - bit of a difference .<ssssss>needless to say that i cancel the taxi through the hotel .<ssssss>however , when we come to leave , the hotel have not actually cancel the taxi and we bag be load into the wrong taxi .<ssssss>it be a good job that we check before set off and get we luggage put in the correct taxi , otherwise we would have be pay a extra $ 50 .<ssssss>overall , i would recommend this hotel to other and would stay there again .<ssssss>
4 3 4 2 5 4 4 -1		perfect for a weekend hotel be close to the underground which make it easily accessible for all tourist location .<ssssss>although there be nothing much to see locally , the hotel be within walk distance to checkpoint charlie -lrb- 5 min -rrb- .<ssssss>room be bright and clean , and service be good .<ssssss>in fact , nothing bad to report about this hotel .<ssssss>good for a weekend !<ssssss>
1 1 3 5 3 4 3 1		worst honeymoon experience ever we choose haiwaii as we honeymoon destination because it be always my dream .<ssssss>we be suppose to be in honolulu for 4 day but cut we trip very short!upon arrival at this hotel , they be so nice and sweet .<ssssss>wehn we arrive to we room , they promise to upgrade we because we be honeymooner but then say they could not because the hotel be full .<ssssss>we do not even get a complimentary bottle of champagne when we get there -lrb- like every other hotel do in hawaii -rrb- .<ssssss>we be advise before book the hotel that it be cater for honeymooner .<ssssss>however , when go outside to the pool , there be many child and no chair anywhere .<ssssss>for 2 day we sit on the grass and try to enjoy the sun .<ssssss>we even get out there the 2nd day at 8am and no seat !<ssssss>a expensive hotel , especially the westin , should be able to accomadate all they guest and this hotel be just not able to .<ssssss>not only do not they feel bad for we , but they be not willing to offer we anything !<ssssss>they be snobby and rude and we will never go back there .<ssssss>they simply do not care about they guest !<ssssss>when we tell they we be leave the hotel early to head to maui , they be not at all concern .<ssssss>they simply say no problem and that they be sorry we be unhappy .<ssssss>who go on a honeymoon and have to sit on the grass ?<ssssss>i never feel so upset in my life .<ssssss>i will never stay at this westin again ... they should learn customer service !<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 3 4 3 -1		cool hotel we arrive at 8pm , the deluxe room we be give be small with no window but a nice inside patio which be small but be a extension of we room and be somewhere to sit .<ssssss>we be tire after a flight from london so we just crash .<ssssss>the follow morning the manager ask we if we like we room , we say we miss a window so he switch we room to a corner room which be a great improvement .<ssssss>we like it and want to stay a extra night but the room have be request so we check out and go to the hyatt for one night.the staff be friendly and the corner room we have be just fine , a little on the small side but the bathroom be big.i love the style of the place , the staff and the location but the size of the room be the only gripe.i would stay there again but only for one night , and only if the room we have be a corner room with window .<ssssss>
2 5 3 2 4 3 4 2		a pleasant surprise i have also read previous review of this hotel and be a little dismayed .<ssssss>but the positive review give I hope as they have be more recent.i be please that the room i have reserve -lrb- one bedroom suite , smoking -rrb- for 10 day be available , as be another one of the same caliber .<ssssss>my room be clean , washroom have everything i need -lrb- but i go and purchase some amenity i like due to my long duration -rrb- .<ssssss>kitchette be very very useful ... i eat out once with friend , the rest i eat in .<ssssss>the hotel have a restaurant now , they be open for breakfast , lunch , and dinner .<ssssss>they be very popular with visitor and local alike between 6 and 7 pm for chinese/american cuisine.i be lucky to get a room on the 5th floor look out over the pool toward kuhio .<ssssss>the noise of kuhio do not bother I nearly as much as it do when i stay at a hotel directly on kuhio.the front desk staff be always helpful for anything i need and i always feel safe in the hotel .<ssssss>housekeeping be available most of the day , and if you need something but do not need a total room refresh , all you have to do be ask.everything you want be right at kuhio ; all within walk distance , and rental car agency be nearby as well.parking be terrible , but the hotel readily advertise this on they website , so anyone who put down this hotel because of that should have do they reading first .<ssssss>i only rent a car twice , the rest of the time everything be do by walk or cabs.i stay in honolulu very very often , but at a different commercial chain .<ssssss>the hokele suite be great for a long stay .<ssssss>the price be great for the hotel style -lrb- typical old honolulu -rrb- , and you really feel like you be at home .<ssssss>if you be only in town for a day or two , then spend 400 $ a night at a beachfront property.around the pool every afternoon and evening be group of retired couple play canasta ... it feel like miami beach ... and very very comfortable .<ssssss>i can see the appeal to they for this hotel ... it be away from the noise and chaos of kalakaua and kuhio.i do not get to see the other room ; mine have a internal entrance like any other hotel , but on the other side of the hotel they be external entrances.if you be worry about what other have say about this place but would like to stay , try to reserve a room where the lanai overlook the pool .<ssssss>my room end in 47 ... so i be assume the rest of the floor be the same.the hotel do not have wireless internet , and contrary to what other have say , it be difficult to hook onto another user ' wireless from the surround building .<ssssss>but there be oceanic high speed available , you ask for the cord at the front desk , connect it to you laptop , and call oceanic if you have any issue connect .<ssssss>rate be daily , weekly , and monthly.i do hope that this hotel will one day have its own wireless or high speed internet access ; but whether you pay for it via time warner oceanic or through hide fee in you room fee , it be all the same in the long run.nice hotel , friendly service , great aloha spirit ... i will definitely stay here again for a extended time in waikiki !<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 3 3 3 2		location be everything just get back from beij - i have read many review about the red wall hotel and be not sure what i would find .<ssssss>bed be hard and carpet be dirty , but i have hot water and clean sheet .<ssssss>have cool air and electric .<ssssss>not bad for a chinese hotel at less than $ 30 we a night .<ssssss>restaurant be okay , but many good restaurant in area .<ssssss>right next door be a neat little hotpot restaurant where you can get a good meal for under $ 4 we .<ssssss>for another dollar you can have a chinese yanjing beer - it be good .<ssssss>if you turn leave out of the hotel - walk a block and turn left again , you will find a neat little market street .<ssssss>there be several restaurant , some with english menu .<ssssss>if you walk all the way to the end of that street you will find the alley cafe .<ssssss>they have american food -lrb- coke , burger and fries for $ 4us -rrb- free internet , and can help with set up trip to the great wall and other place .<ssssss>as you be walk down this street about half way down to the left be a alley way that have a chinese food store .<ssssss>it , be a good place to pick up snack .<ssssss>this be where the local shop .<ssssss>the best thing about this hotel be the location .<ssssss>you can walk to the forbid city , tian ` a man square , jing shan park , bei hai park , wangfuje street - all less than 25 minute .<ssssss>i even wake to the lama temple which take 45 minute , but there be several cool hutong on the way .<ssssss>somewhere between the hotel and the lama temple i find a neat little place - the pass by bar - good mutton and cheese pizza .<ssssss>worst thing about this hotel be that taxi driver do not know where it be , but i just have they drop I off at jing shan park and walk the 5 mintue to the hotel .<ssssss>overall , i be please with this place .<ssssss>if you want to travel in style , then do not stay here - however , if you like a little adventure and a good chinese experience then this place be it .<ssssss>oh yeah - take a good street map with you - you will not find a good one in beij - you will need it .<ssssss>larry brown - oklahoma<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 2 1 4 -1		mirror mirror on the wall , we be disappoint of they all .<ssssss>my family and i stay at the waikiki wave this past memorial day weekend for a total of 6 night .<ssssss>the issue already start when we book through hotwire .<ssssss>when read the review online find out that there be noise issue , we immediately call the hotel and ask for a upgrade to a higher floor and chri the aqua wave representative ask I to call hotwire to get the upgrade .<ssssss>-lrb- i advise he that i be fine with pay the extra money for the upgrade -rrb- .<ssssss>when we call hotwire they tell I to call the hotel back and so , we be already get the run around .<ssssss>we be adamant , but hotwire work it out with aqua wave , so chris note this on my accomodation base upon availability .<ssssss>to make along story short , no upgrade upon check in since of course aqua waikiki wave be completely book due to memorial day weekend .<ssssss>larissa and george be not very accomodate upon check in , almost to the point of a condenscending attitude .<ssssss>they tell we that there would be no availability until after monday -lrb- memorial day -rrb- .<ssssss>one would think that they would do everything in they power to generate revenue for a guest willing to pay for a upgrade .<ssssss>on monday , we ask again if there would be room availability for a upgrade and be tell that they would not know until tuesday morning when the guest have check out .<ssssss>this disappointed we more since once again , why be the staff not train enough to care about its guest and it concern ?<ssssss>especially if it would of make we stay more pleasurable and we be willing to pay.now for the noise .<ssssss>we be place on the 5th floor face the international market near the food court where the minus hawaiian dance/concerts be hold .<ssssss>in fairness to the hotel , the only night that there be major noise be saturday evening , and early sunday morning when the dance club let out and lastly morning when the garbage pick up be be implement .<ssssss>be centrally located be good but , i be pleased to say that the noise factor be not as bothersome as expected.the parking situation - well the secret be go out early and get back before dinner time .<ssssss>one evening we do not get back early enough and have to park near by the contract parking lot with aqua waikiki wave .<ssssss>if you do not need a car in waikiki , do you self a favor and dont rent one either that or just rent a car for a day or two , to avoid the headache and parking fee all together .<ssssss>i must agree with the guest parking the slot be narrow and if you have something like a full size suv you option would be worse .<ssssss>this be we 5th time on the island and have stay with the starwood chain hotel in the past .<ssssss>the room we stay in be slightly above average in waikiki .<ssssss>the bathroom do have lighting issue , we think that the bulb the hotel use be the new energy saver that come on rather dark until it illuminate fully .<ssssss>shower and tub be not up date as the fixture be quite the 70 's decor .<ssssss>the sink area be upgrade with new sink , update fixture and granite counter tops.finally , here be the positive .<ssssss>concierge service be excellent .<ssssss>michael be most helpful , super patient and very accomodate to we excursion need .<ssssss>no matter how busy he be , no matter how many people be wait and he desk phone be ring and be alone in the morning shift when he partner be not there .<ssssss>he take great care to ensure that we be happy with we excursion and check on we post the booking to get feed back !<ssssss>excellent !!!<ssssss>kudos.the house keep staff be excellent and efficient .<ssssss>we request towel and extra pillow and earplug and for all 3 occasion not even 10 min would go by and there would be a knock on we door with the item we request .<ssssss>even in the late evening !<ssssss>we bell hop , be great !<ssssss>we daughter luggage be delay by one day and he do everything to keep a look out for the unite representative to ensure that the luggage be deliver .<ssssss>everyday he greet we and offer he assistance during return from shopping excursions.we have stay in 5 star hotel -lrb- ritz carlton four season -rrb- and 2 star hotel -lrb- residence inn by marriott -rrb- .<ssssss>all these hotel common denominator in success be they front desk staff and they willingness to ensure guest be welcome and accomodation be fulfil to full satisfaction .<ssssss>aqua waikiki wave need to take its front desk staff and send they to customer relation class every 6 month and invest in they .<ssssss>they be the front line to customer to ensure that they be up to par with ensure 100 % customer satisfaction during and post stay at they facility .<ssssss>over all , we stay be ok a side from some problem .<ssssss>if the improvement note above would be implement then maybe we would return .<ssssss>i do agree with the value but , at the same time dont comprise you guest relation services.njcava0122<ssssss>

2 2 2 2 5 2 2 3		ok but noisy !<ssssss>this hotel be in a rather strange location be newly build in the part of seattle that really still a huge building site , it will probably be great in 5 year time!the hotel itself be very slick and the decor be typical pan-asian muted brown and cream with very nice bathroom and we have a great view of the sky needle from we room .<ssssss>on the downside , the construction site in front and to the side of the hotel start at 7am -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>so no lie-in there and both of we think the bed be very soft and uncomfortable.thw whole food market below the hotel be a great convenience and the pizza place next door be excellent.over all stay here if you do not mind the construction noise and a bit of a walk to the main site .<ssssss>

4 2 4 -1 2 -1 4 -1		6/1/06 - 6/7/06 have a great time ... probably would not go back .<ssssss>ok ... first of all ... i think it be important to know where a person be come from when they be give a review .<ssssss>with that in mind ... the follow help to define that ... about uswe be a couple in we 30 's .<ssssss>we have one child and value romantic getaway that be adult only ... we have travel a lot and have stay in the following country -lrb- mexico , tahiti , bora bora , spain , canada , barbado , martinique , st. maarten , bahama -rrb- .<ssssss>we consider ourselves work middle class and though we live within we means and budget wisely , we save to travel and love it!why we choose this resortwe have consider go back to the riviera maya but with last year 's hurricane , we decide when we plan this trip , to try a different all-inclusive and read some great thing about punta cana .<ssssss>we choose secret because of the adult only , beautiful beach , and variety of restaurant within the resort .<ssssss>we overall feeling about we trip ... we have a great time , think the location be beautiful , but would not stay there again.the resort ... it be lay out very nicely .<ssssss>spread out , but not so much that you have to walk a ton to get to anything .<ssssss>the lobby be very nice .<ssssss>lot of water feature everywhere .<ssssss>lot of nature and beauty .<ssssss>in front of the hotel be large grounds with trail , bridge , garden , and water feature .<ssssss>we have a nice time walk around it and take pictures.our room ... we originally book a regular room but when we arrive we take a look at it and be offer to upgrade to a excellence suite with ocean view .<ssssss>we look at we regular room then look at the excellence room and agree to pay the extra $ 100 a night for the upgrade .<ssssss>there be no way we could turn it down consider the original room have a view of some construction and a run down garden area .<ssssss>the excellence room be great .<ssssss>we have a corner room with balcony that wrap around 2 side .<ssssss>we be right over the pool with a unobstructed gorgeous view of the ocean .<ssssss>-lrb- they really know how to make it irresistable to turn down -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be larger than the first and be much brighter and cheerier .<ssssss>the tub that separate the bedroom from the vanity area be in all room and be very nice .<ssssss>we have bathrobe , slipper , bottle of champagne and fruit tray .<ssssss>that first night at turn down service ... the maid fill the tub with bubble and bougainvilia petal and have candle light all around the tub .<ssssss>the minus fridge be a waste .<ssssss>it be never cold enough to make anything refreshing enough to drink without we chill thing first in a ice bucket .<ssssss>the bed of doom ... ok this part really put a damper on we vacation .<ssssss>we like firm bed .<ssssss>we both have bad back and appreciate a bed that you do not sink into cause you back to be out of line ... but this bed be torturous .<ssssss>it be like sleep on the marble floor .<ssssss>it be a rock hard firm mattress on slat of wood .<ssssss>we wake up the first morning so stiff ... we call and talk to someone about the bed but be tell there be nothing they could do about it .<ssssss>we decide to try and sleep outside on one of the pool bed .<ssssss>problem be ... they cover all those every night with all the pool floaty and lounge cushion .<ssssss>we start get up really early at 6am and go out after they take everything off the palapa bed and get some rest there for a few hour every morning .<ssssss>if the bed have be normal ... we room would have be truly excellent.the pool ... we enjoy the pool .<ssssss>it be long , however not as long and large as some other resort we have be to -lrb- palace resort -rrb- .<ssssss>the water temp be warm ... not refresh enough from the aweful heat .<ssssss>it do have some nice nook and cranny for privacy and some shaded area as well .<ssssss>we really enjoy the pool palapa bed .<ssssss>that be great to be able to lie there all day in the shade and enjoy read a book and stretch out .<ssssss>people do however hog the floaty and i must say ... to all of you who think it be acceptable to stow away a hotel floatie under you loiunge chair all day with you use of it consist of a total of 15 minute the whole day ... shame on you for you selfishness.when we find one and use it ... we leave it in the pool for someone else to use when we be do .<ssssss>if everyone do that ... there would never be a shortage for anyone.the beach ... this be the best part of this resort !<ssssss>we love love love the beach here .<ssssss>apart from the south pacific island ... this be the only place i have be where you could walk on the beach and be the only one .<ssssss>it be a huge beach with a very wide sand bank between the resort and the ocean .<ssssss>it can seriously burn you foot if you try to get to the ocean without flip flop on .<ssssss>the red flag be out every day -lrb- do they ever change it ? -rrb-<ssssss>but the tide be never strong .<ssssss>at all .<ssssss>not in the least .<ssssss>it be awesome !<ssssss>we boogie board just about every day .<ssssss>the stinky thing be ... they will only let you check the board out for a hour at a time even though they always have a surplus available .<ssssss>we have a great time do it though ... just be a long walk back to the boogie board hut .<ssssss>one thing we be very disappointed in that i would recommend to those who have not be tell ... we have no idea that around to the right side of the beach , if you walk a while ... you will come to a shore with reef a plenty for great snorkeling .<ssssss>the hotel have flipper and mask you can check out and we see they ... but we do not know you could actually get to some reef if you go beyond the resort .<ssssss>i wish we have know .<ssssss>: -lrb- the bars/drinksthis part of the resort be so-so .<ssssss>it really depend on which bar you go to and who be mix .<ssssss>but we find consistent drink mixed well at the main lobby bar by the bordeoux restaurant at night .<ssssss>there be no refrigeration of drink except the water bottle and presidente beer bottle .<ssssss>soda be not refrigerate , thus water down upon mix with ice .<ssssss>we fare ok .<ssssss>i do love the dirty monkey no matter where i get them.the restaurantswe try all except the dominican .<ssssss>same reason as why most do not .<ssssss>not that much into cabrito -lrb- goat meat -rrb- , though it be dominican 's most popular dish and probably good.that restaurant along with the mexican el patio share a building .<ssssss>we enjoy the mexican resaurant and the service there .<ssssss>they have a 3 man mariachus group who sing and play for $ and the lighting/ambiance be lovely there.one room house 3 restaurant .<ssssss>the main buffet which serve daily breakfast and lunch , turn into italian on one side and japanese on the other side at night .<ssssss>we love the japanese -lrb- himitsu -rrb- .<ssssss>think the food be very good .<ssssss>great spring roll and sushi.the italian be ... below average .<ssssss>the 2 ocean front reastaurant be open air palapa and we do not enjoy either one much .<ssssss>the beef be below par quality .<ssssss>i be shock that there be not more seafood option such as crab leg or lobster consider we be on the ocean and i actually see a large crab on the beach one day .<ssssss>we never see lobster be offer and though the french restaurant serve lobster bisque , it be more of a seafood consume make from the remnant of the day ' other seafood fare.we enjoy the french restaurant and they server and they have the best desserts.for the most part i would say the resort be lack in the food department .<ssssss>it would be great if they have a actual sea side grill .<ssssss>a actual grill ... where you could walk up and get grilled seafood , sausage , hamburger ... etc. as we have see at other ocean/pool side all inclusive .<ssssss>*** important **** we reserve a romatic dinner at the open air oceana restaurant one evening .<ssssss>we be seat on the patio with a view of the ocean .<ssssss>there be 4 other couple do the same thing that evening .<ssssss>we be seat at 6:30 pm and within 15 minute bite midge be attack I .<ssssss>now , ofcourse i do not know what they be at the time .<ssssss>i think mosquito be get we .<ssssss>needless to say ... all 5 of we couple have to gulp down what little food they have bring by that point and leave asap !<ssssss>that be a week ago and i be still suffer with these demonic bug bite .<ssssss>i become very concerned yesterday as new bump seem to keep pop up and they itch like poison hell fire or something .<ssssss>in spanish they be call gegene -lrb- heh-heh-ne -rrb- but in english we know they as no see um or sand fly .<ssssss>they be basically midget mosquito gnat and can actually infect you with a microfilareia -lrb- small larva worm -rrb- .<ssssss>my only remedy be to apply pruitic cream and take antihistamine for relief .<ssssss>again , they real name be bite midge.now mind you ... we have take bug repellant and have be to the night time beach party , horseback ride , lay around the pool , etc and have never be bite by anything so do not feel like i need to apply chemical .<ssssss>this situation happen on the night before we leave , on the patio of the pool side restaurant .<ssssss>if i have be wear repellant i be sure they would not have get I .<ssssss>my husband have just a few bite .<ssssss>i however , have both leg , arm , neck , and ear cover in these aweful pustule .<ssssss>again , it be be 6 day since that night .<ssssss>ughhh !!!!<ssssss>i have since learn they fly in swarm and stay very close to they nest .<ssssss>they probably have a nest in the bush by the patio .<ssssss>the spawe have a couple massage at midnight on the beach one night .<ssssss>it be lovely , in candlelight .<ssssss>very relaxing.excursionswe do the free horseback ride one morning .<ssssss>it be fun .<ssssss>my horse keep try to bite my husband 's .<ssssss>it be a lot of laugh .<ssssss>i be extremely sore the next day ... which just remind I of the laugh .<ssssss>: -rrb- one day we do the carribean festival which be take a horrible hour and 20 minute ride on a open air jalopy to bavaro beach and get on a very fun double deck boat which take we to a lack snorkeling site ... then to a fence in tank in the ocean where they hold 2 nurse shark and 2 manta ray .<ssssss>i get to swim with and run my hand along a 15 foot long nurse shark .<ssssss>that be exhilirate .<ssssss>i do however feel very sad for the creature stick in this fence in tank which probably measure 35 ft x 35 ft. there be 3 such tanks.the party boat though be a great time and make that way by the staff/dancers .<ssssss>they put on a mini carnival and really make the crowd participate and have fun .<ssssss>they be excellent dancer and entertainer .<ssssss>we have to make the hour and 20 minute ride back to secret ... it sucked.the staffus find that the majority of the staff be not from the dominican republic .<ssssss>those that be , be from far away on the island .<ssssss>they live in a commune across the street from the resort .<ssssss>they work very long hour ... some work 11 day in a row then have 3 day off .<ssssss>the same people serve breakfast and work in the morning be there at 8pm still serve dinner and working .<ssssss>every one be train to look you in the eye no matter where or when they encounter you and greet you .<ssssss>i appreciate this much and it remind I how sad american culture be consider most people look away or act like they do not see you when you be walk past they .<ssssss>the staff be train ... when you ask they how they be ... to say excellent .<ssssss>they be also train to respond it be my pleasure no matter what you say or ask of they .<ssssss>we tip a lot ... and i begin to feel as if a lot of they be embarrassed or uncomfortable with this .<ssssss>before we leave ... i go and find this one hostess who really go out of she way and be great ... to give she a $ 20 bill before we leave .<ssssss>i tell she we really appreciate she service and hard work and she seem embarrassed to accept the money and state it be my job.i have a feeling ... that with all the tip go on ... we leave the impression that money be disposable .<ssssss>i tip because i feel like i do not know how much these people be get pay and what if they be get jipp or be take advantage of ... therefore i want to help let they know they be worth more than they think .<ssssss>how presumptuous of I .<ssssss>we as american can be so pompously naive sometimes.ok enough of the social commentary ... overall ... we have a great time .<ssssss>we would not go back there because we like to experience different area , culture and resort .<ssssss>we only revisit somewhere if it be exceptional which we do not think this resort be .<ssssss>the negative ... - upkeep on the property be lack as far as building maintenance , cleanliness of the elevator , and upkeep of the older room .<ssssss>- the bed - the quality of the food - the heavy , oppressive , humid heat - the bite midge - the government 's lack of use fund properly to develop better road .<ssssss>i know they be receive a ton of $ $ from the grand developer who be redefine the coastline ... yet the people be beyond lack and the land be a wastelandthe positive ... - the awesome beach and coastline - the layout of the room - the friendliness of the staff - the animal wander -lrb- beautiful peacock in the lobby one day -rrb- - the privacy , no kid , secluded location - the helicopter ride back to the airport ... totally awesome !<ssssss>what a coastline!it be worth vacation here because it be always great to visit a new place!it 's worth it to visit a beach and a coastline not yet infiltrate by hotel after hotel after hotel !<ssssss>

1 2 1 5 1 3 4 3		ymmv , -lrb- you mileage may vary -rrb- well i must say the hotel be central to the site you will want to visit in florence , but ... my wife and i stay 2 night , 2 different room .<ssssss>1st night room # 206 , face the indoor roof line , -lrb- center of a square doughnut -rrb- , room be of decent size , double bed , small 13 inch t.v. mount high on the wall , hardwood floor , thin wall noise outside room come right in and i assume we noise carry back out .<ssssss>but the bad news for this hotel be the bathroom , ugh .<ssssss>mold in the shower , wall grout etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the worst be the shower curtain , look like it have not be change in year , moldy , water stain , inexcusable for a item that retail 5 euro or less .<ssssss>complain that night to move , but no other room available , next morning we be ready to move to another hotel , but they then agree to switch we to another room that be come available in the afternoon .<ssssss>room 202 face via strozzi , so there be a bit of street noise from below , much better room , carpet on the floor , nice double bed , -lrb- actually 2 singles put together -rrb- - but again , the bathroom , no visible mold ... but , you know the smell , this hotel have a problem , i suggest they fix it quickly .<ssssss>we experience be with 2 different room .<ssssss>i would think you can find something better , we choose it out ot the rick steve guide , i would hope he drop this place in the 2007 edition .<ssssss>breakfast be standard european fare , staff be nice , friendly , air condition work well in both room .<ssssss>but mold , just say no and pass on this place .<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 5 5 4 1		surprisingly nice staying in waikiki on a budget can be a really challenge , but if you be look for a good option , i would recommend check out the royal garden waikikus .<ssssss>on a whim , we book room on priceline for about $ 90/night and be reward with a nice room on the 15th floor with a king bed .<ssssss>the room have great bathroom , a microwave , cable television , and a comfortable decor .<ssssss>the staff be quite friendly and helpful - we have the concierge call a taxi to the airport for we , and the next morning , we wake up to find a limousine taxi wait for we -lrb- for no extra charge over a normal taxi ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i think the key to stay here be to have reasonable expectation .<ssssss>this be not the hilton hawaii village .<ssssss>it do not have wi-fus , fancy restaurant , include breakfast , and other three-star and up amenity .<ssssss>what it do offer be a nice , quiet , and comfortable room at a reasonable price .<ssssss>you will be locate a short ten minute walk from the heart of waikiki , and since thebus system be so good , it be really easy to get around .<ssssss>give this place a shot if you be look for value in waikiki .<ssssss>

4 5 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great experience at embassy suite dorado we be very surprise by the great experience we have here .<ssssss>we usually stay at resort that be a notch higher that the embassy suites-but the rate/breakfast deal be appeal .<ssssss>we be there w / we 2 kids-age 5?1/2 almost 3 .<ssssss>the hotel itself be beautiful-grounds , pool area , maintenance , esp .<ssssss>compare to other -lrb- older -rrb- embassy suite .<ssssss>the beach be small-but great for kid .<ssssss>the pool be perfect for begin swimmer , as well as non-swimming little one .<ssssss>the breakfast be always crowd , but managable .<ssssss>the room be well keep perfect size for 4 people .<ssssss>the two negative be this : some of the service be poor-meaning slow .<ssssss>however , overall the people work be pleasant try to please the guest .<ssssss>the other negative be there be no nighlife whatsoever .<ssssss>there be some great local restaurant where the food be worth it-but if you like to stay up past 9pm-there be very little to do in dorado .<ssssss>overall , i would definitely recommend the hotel would return there .<ssssss>
5 2 4 2 5 4 5 -1		a great hotel the four season in mexico city , for all its problem , remain a fantastic hotel .<ssssss>its value be greatly increase if you book during a off-peak period , when rate can be significantly lower.service be unparalleled .<ssssss>as with many other four season property , staff be train to get to know you and fulfill you need beyond you expectation .<ssssss>by and large this be the case , particularly if cost be not a issue .<ssssss>the concierge service , for example , can provide you with a car and driver any time , any day , any hour ... if you be willing to pay $ 28 a hour -lrb- $ 33 if he be to provide explanation -rrb- , rather than the $ 11 a hour charge by a regular taxi -lrb- which the concierge will be willing to get for you , no question ask -- although it be worth note that you may get some very un-four seasons-like attitude from the bellboy for have the temerity to go the low-class ordinary taxi route -rrb- .<ssssss>as for food , the news be mixed .<ssssss>the service at the four season bar be excellent if you go when there be few other patron ; it be , otherwise , severely understaff , lead to frustrated guest .<ssssss>room service be limit in its option ; have try different item from its menu over a period of five day , it be reasonably safe to say that the italian menu item be mediocre at best .<ssssss>though beautifully present , they be nowhere near the level that you would expect from a hotel of this caliber .<ssssss>morning coffee be often stale , evening coffee even worse .<ssssss>in fact , the only saving grace with respect to food in this hotel be a spectacular pastry chef , who serve chocolate croissant that be to die for.why then , the five star review ?<ssssss>it be pretty simple : this be likely the best hotel in the city .<ssssss>the service remain extraordinary : yes , room service may get you order wrong , and the quality may be poor .<ssssss>but bottom line be that they will try to fulfill any oddball request you might have -- and indeed , by the time you leave , you feel as if you would expect to have you whim fulfil by they .<ssssss>and the same be true of the concierge , driver , waiter , and just about everyone else at the hotel -lrb- except the bellboy staff if you order a taxi -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be clean and _ organize _ not once , but twice , and possibly thrice a day .<ssssss>housekeeping be possibly the best i have ever see at any hotel i have ever stay at.the staff of chauffeur , too , be top notch , beginning -lrb- but likely not end -rrb- with the excellent edmundo.finally , mexico city be a huge city , loud , and ultimately drain for the average tourist .<ssssss>it be a cliche repeat by other who come to this hotel , but it really be a oasis in that city .<ssssss>when you be do with a morning and afternoon 's event , have a late coffee in the hotel 's courtyard -lrb- serve by fantastic waiter like the hotel 's jesÃºs -rrb- be genuinely soothing .<ssssss>and come to you room be truly restful .<ssssss>you can not ask for too much more than that .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 5 5 5 -1		as expect - perfect for quick airport stay we stay here for one very short night .<ssssss>we have reserve here because we know we be land late and leave the next morning .<ssssss>think it would be the most convenient and it be .<ssssss>be even more convenient when we flight be delay 5 hour and we arrive at 3 a.m. lot of people sleep on the airport floor since no room be available in san juan -lrb- think jet blue ice storm on east coast -- a mess -rrb- .<ssssss>room be clean .<ssssss>bathroom and t.v. be very small .<ssssss>bed comfortable and no airport noise .<ssssss>breakfast be fine for continental.biggest complaint : they be renovate sju so we awake to jackhammer at 7 a.m. -lrb- which stink give that we would only just go to bed ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>would stay here again if i need a quick airport layover .<ssssss>
5 5 5 3 4 5 5 3		perfect when visit barcelona in summer my husband and i be look forwards to we first visit to barcelona this summer and decide to stay at the grand marina hotel due to its location near the beach , the swimming pool and the great review on tripadvisor.com !<ssssss>and we be not disappointed , the service be excellent and when we ask to get a room with a balcony as the first room we get do not have one , they be very accommodate and a room with a balcony be provide !<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be fantastic and even though it be not include we end up eat there almost every day .<ssssss>the hotel be not far from las ramblas and a subway station .<ssssss>in addition it be only a ten fifteen minute walk to the beach .<ssssss>we end up spend a lot of time on the beach , and as such only enjoy the pool of the hotel one day .<ssssss>i must say this about the pool , it really be very very small , but very nice .<ssssss>
4 5 3 3 4 4 5 -1		great kid club the hotel be very nice and lot of activity for kid !<ssssss>we kid never like kid club but love all of the teacher , meet the other kid , eat meal there -lrb- they beg we to eat at the kid corner -rrb- and go to the mini disco each night .<ssssss>the hotel also have great show every evening which the kid love .<ssssss>bring bug repellent for the mosquito .<ssssss>not sure if it be seasonal or all year round .<ssssss>the staff be all very nice.enjoy you stay .<ssssss>
2 1 4 -1 4 -1 4 -1		not good for business traveler the hotel be clean and the staff be very friendly .<ssssss>the free hot beverage service in the morning also come a a pleasant surprise .<ssssss>however , the hotel be a bit stingy on business-type amenity , consider what be include at comparable hotel with similar rate .<ssssss>they charge a extra $ 9.95 per day for internet access and local call , and 10 cent a minute for use of they business center .<ssssss>the lack of include local call come as a surprise , as i get bit by a $ 1 charge to make a local call to a destinaton just a few block away .<ssssss>the lack of free local call couple with a lack of a decent cell phone signal in the room very much limited what i could get do in my hotel room.if you be in town for leisure , this hotel may be one place to consider .<ssssss>however , if you be in town for business and need to stay connected , i would recommend that you look elsewhere , as other hotel in the area with similar rate offer more for the business traveler .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 3 -1 3 -1		very average have read all the good review on this site which be why we book the sofitel - these people obviously do not stay in the same hotel as we do .<ssssss>only consistency be that i note that other people have talk about block toliet and aircondition go out which both happen to we .<ssssss>the room be so very boring and we non-smoking room have old tobacco smell in it , all in all a very unimpressive hotel .<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 4 1 2 -1		kid love the pool we family stay at this hotel for 3 night on we return to australia from europe in early october .<ssssss>unfortunately , we have a bad start which do impact upon we stay .<ssssss>upon arrival early evening after a long flight from rome we be face with a mistake with we booking .<ssssss>i have book and pay for two ` garden wing ' room -lrb- breakfast include -rrb- with asia room -lrb- locally rmg tour -rrb- .<ssssss>we be tell that only one room have be reserve for we and that breakfast be not include .<ssssss>after about 45 minute of question with no apology and be make to feel we be at fault , we be finally give two room -lrb- not interconnect and only one with a view -rrb- .<ssssss>we be tell we could change to interconnect room the following evening .<ssssss>-lrb- this do not happen as two interconnect room with garden view do not become available -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel say they would contact rmg tour in the morning .<ssssss>-lrb- this be not do and my husband have to call rmg tour himself -rrb- .<ssssss>my husband also request from the hotel copy of the paper work they have receive from rmg tour -lrb- this paperwork he never receive -rrb- .<ssssss>rmg tour confirm that we have book and pay for two ` garden wing ' room although they be unsure about whether breakfast be include .<ssssss>they call the hotel and late the next morning -lrb- after breakfast -rrb- all be finally confirm .<ssssss>we be never able to ascertain whom be at fault .<ssssss>we do however receive wine and chocolate from the hotel .<ssssss>my advice do not use asiarooms.com and certainly do not use any website that ask for payment prior to travel .<ssssss>always call the hotel a few day prior to arrive to confirm you booking.overall the hotel be very nice - what you would expect of a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>we teenage kid love the pool .<ssssss>it be not too tricky get a seat as can be at some hotel .<ssssss>i think this be because the staff remove lonesome towel regularly .<ssssss>breakfast be excellent -lrb- but the best ever be the jumeriah beach hotel in dubai -rrb- .<ssssss>bed be very spacious and comfortable .<ssssss>we would stay here again but i would book directly and confirm prior to arrival .<ssssss>

4 4 4 3 5 3 5 5		great hotel for business or vacation this be a great hotel for either business or vacation â€?expensive , but nice .<ssssss>i stay at the ritz carlton from nov 28 - dec 2 .<ssssss>the first 2 day we hold a business meeting there and we be all impress with the hotel room , the meeting room and the service .<ssssss>the meeting room have wireless internet service and the business lunch be very good .<ssssss>the corporate rate be amazing : $ 165 -lrb- it amount to $ 200 after tax and resort fee , which be still a great deal -rrb- .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t get a room with a balcony , but the room still have a combination water view/pool view .<ssssss>we prior meeting be hold at the caribe hilton and this be a much better place to go for a meeting .<ssssss>we have dinner at the italian restaurant in the hotel -lrb- il mulino -rrb- â€?very good and very expensive .<ssssss>the portion be extremely large , so if youâ€™re in a group i suggest share entree or order the appetizer size portion .<ssssss>the last 2 day of my trip my sister join I for a few day of vacation .<ssssss>i be able to get the corporate rate for the remain 2 day â€?what a deal !<ssssss>i get a pedicure at the spa â€?even though i e-mailed my request for a spa treatment without the 24-hour notice , they be able to accommodate I at the request time .<ssssss>the post rate be $ 75 but it end up cost around $ 95 by the time they add tip and tax .<ssssss>this be the most i have spend on a pedicure â€?i hope it last .<ssssss>the spa service be friendly and professional .<ssssss>the fitness center be great and the class be very good â€?not easy at all .<ssssss>if you take a few class a day you be bind to return fitter than you arrive .<ssssss>most of the cardio equipment have they own tv .<ssssss>all headphone be clean after use .<ssssss>water bottle and fresh towel be place on all piece of equipment , and the instructor would hand out cold bottle .<ssssss>the one negative about the fitness center be they only have 2 elliptical machine -lrb- which everyone want to use -rrb- , and they be very much in need of service , make loud banging noise if someone use they .<ssssss>i find the noise quite annoying while i be exercise - they should have place â€œout of serviceâ€?notices on they .<ssssss>the pool and the beach be nice .<ssssss>there be just one pool and one hot tub , but there always seem to be available chair .<ssssss>there be always lot of towel guy hang around to find you a chair .<ssssss>my only complaint about the pool area be the lack of beverage/food service .<ssssss>there be only a few people take food and drink order â€?not enough to cover everyone .<ssssss>not one approach we to ask we if we want something â€?we have to chase they down or go to the bar and order on we own .<ssssss>i find this surprising because the ratio of hotel service people to guest be extremely high throughout the rest of the hotel â€?twice when i ask how to find something -lrb- a restaurant or meeting room -rrb- , someone take the time to walk I there .<ssssss>the room be nice .<ssssss>the air conditioning be adjustable and there be flat screen tv and free internet .<ssssss>the one thing we didnâ€™t like about the room be the lack of a internal privacy lock and lack of â€œdo not disturbâ€?signs -lrb- call â€œshhâ€?signs in the hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>we room do not have a â€œshhâ€?sign , and a member of the housekeeping staff walk in on my sister while she be get dress .<ssssss>we then ask for a â€œshhâ€?sign for the door , which disappear the next day -lrb- perhaps take by another guest who need one -rrb- .<ssssss>i would prefer a privacy lock on the door .<ssssss>i have a evening flight , and the hotel provide â€œchanging roomsâ€?rather than let you check out beyond 1:30 pm .<ssssss>overall , this be a very nice hotel , which be why iâ€™m take the time to write this , and i would definitely go back .<ssssss>this hotel be highly recommend for business travel and for a business meeting location .<ssssss>itâ€™s also a nice place for vacation traveler who arenâ€™t pinch penny and be ok with $ 24 breakfast and $ 14 pina colada .<ssssss>

2 1 2 -1 3 -1 5 -1		good location , poor hotel .<ssssss>the only reason stop I from give this hotel 1 star be that the service be excellent when we arrive , the guy take we suitcase and within 5 minute we be check in .<ssssss>the room however be very , very basic , it be a room for three people but there be only two cup , there be plate for food but no knife or fork , the room we stay in be very dark and dull , even with all the light on it be dull .<ssssss>we have to go to reception twice because the toilet overflow .<ssssss>the bathroom be very small , the kitchen area would only fit one person at a time .<ssssss>the hotel be pretty close to time square but the view from the hotel room be terrible .<ssssss>also , the taxi driver have no idea where this hotel be and if you do not have you room card handy to show they you be screwed.it be beyond I how anyone could give this hotel more than two star .<ssssss>
4 4 5 2 5 4 5 -1		almost perfect - avoid noisy 6th floor !<ssssss>i be very impressed with this hotel - the decor be amazing and the room very comfortable and clean .<ssssss>however if you be book room here , make sure they be not on 6th floor .<ssssss>there be a lovely roof terrace bar at the top of the hotel which be the floor above 6th .<ssssss>there be a huge amount of noise from chair be drag around the roof terrace , which be particularly bad at night .<ssssss>it actually wake we up from we sleep on many occasion and go on well into the night .<ssssss>out of a party of 7 , the other have room on other floor and have no such complaint .<ssssss>that say , i would have no other complaint about he hotel .<ssssss>i find the staff to be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>i think the breakfast be a bit steep at â‚ ?<ssssss>6 , however some of we party indulge and say it be well worth it for the choice and quality of food .<ssssss>we all eat at the hotel restaurant one of the evening and enjoy it very much .<ssssss>the hotel room itself be perfect - very comfy bed , curtain that work on a switch mechanism and a complicated but cool lighting system where you can play around with different level of dimming .<ssssss>from a design point of view its ultra-modern and quirky but do not lose anything on comfort in the process.the standard ot cleaning be excellent - room be attend to twice daily and sweet leave on the bed each day.i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visit barcelona - the location be good , a little out of the centre but not too far out - taxi usually cost about â‚ ?<ssssss>to la rambla and around that area .<ssssss>the price in the hotel bar be very expensive , but there be plenty of place around to indulge in a cheaper tipple - cocktail be better value at â‚ ?<ssssss>0 and delicious !<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		good all-round vacation general comment ************************************ my wife and i be regular caribbean traveller , and generally fairly easy to please .<ssssss>however , in some way we be pleasantly surprise by this resort .<ssssss>entertainment be so-so , and the room be not great , but face it ; if the room be clean -lrb- and they be -rrb- , who care about the room ?<ssssss>you be in the caribbean to be outside and enjoy the beach and the weather.we be there with sunwing , and i have to say that the sunwing rep be good ; service be good -lrb- we fly out of halifax -rrb- , and the sunwing rep in dr be at the hotel every day .<ssssss>we do not run into any problem , but i definitely get the feeling that they be ready to help.food ************************************ i think the food be good .<ssssss>i definitely prefer da mario , and we eat there 4 time in we 7 day there .<ssssss>the buffet -lrb- window -rrb- have theme night , and several time we eat dinner at the buffet .<ssssss>they put on a lot of effort , and the mexican night at the buffet beat the tex-mex grill hand down.the tex-mex be so-so .<ssssss>people have different likes and dislikes , but as a fan of mexican food i be not impress with the offering .<ssssss>oddly , there be no guacamole the night we be there , although there be lot of it at the buffet mexican night a couple of evening later.the beach cafe be standard convenience food , pizza , sandwich , hamburger and the like .<ssssss>they usually set up some kind of bbq next to the cafe for lunch , and sometimes they have pasta , rice , etc. i do not really try it , but friend who do say it be good.breakfasts be good , lot of variety , and -lrb- for those who like it -rrb- the standard north american breakfast fare .<ssssss>good selection of fruit.i have beein in cuba three time , and the food definitely beat cuba .<ssssss>probably not as good as i have have in mexico , but close.rooms ************************************ the room be clean , but a little dated .<ssssss>i think you have to be careful with the patio door , since they do not seem to close very well , but that would be more of a issue on the ground floor .<ssssss>service be good , and we leave a little something for the maid every day .<ssssss>i notice that the maid use to come in the evening and turn down the bed , which be nice .<ssssss>lot of towel , and the room bar be stock every day .<ssssss>i notice that as the week go on , the maid be leave more and more beer in the fridge!a / c be a little weak , but once i figure out that you patio door need to be firmly close in order for it to work , no problems.we use the room safe -lrb- a $ 15 charge -rrb- , but have no problem with other thing leave around the room -lrb- watch , camera , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>we see the room in building 7 -lrb- the new buliding -rrb- , and they be very nice , jacuzzi , nice walk-in shower , larger , etc. friend we meet move over there at extra cost .<ssssss>someone mention that you could pay abou $ 100 pp and stay there , and depend on how important the room be to you it might be worth it .<ssssss>we consider move once we see they , but end up stay where we were.beaches ************************************ the beach be nice .<ssssss>as other people have mention , there be a lot of seaweed around ; staff at the hotel tell we that this be unusual , and be probably a reflection of the hurricane and windstorm that have happen this year .<ssssss>i be usually down on the beach at 6 or 7 be , and could see the team of worker who rake up the seaweed and haul it away every morning -lrb- and during the day -rrb- .<ssssss>not much they can do about mother nature , but they definitely work at it.no bar service on the beach .<ssssss>closest be the beach cafe , just up from the beach .<ssssss>good service.lots of kayak , windsurfer , sailboat etc on the beach .<ssssss>we be tell that you have to do a $ 25 course in order to be allow to take the catamaran out , but the guy at the aquatic centre just ask I if i know how to sail , and let I take the hoby out without any course .<ssssss>i notice several people who do not seem to have a clue about sailing -lrb- include one guy who keep try to point the boat directly into the wind to get off the beach -rrb- , but they seem to graciously get those people back on shore and out of the boat .<ssssss>only allow one time a day , but several time other people book boat and i go out with they since they do not know how to sail .<ssssss>the hoby be in good condition , and usually a good breeze .<ssssss>one day they take the boat off the water because it be too windy , but they usually let people go even in a stiff breeze .<ssssss>i give a tip here and there , and although the service be good anyway , they definitely seem to remember I a little more after a tip or two.some snorkel right off the beach , and i could usually see a few fish by the rock outcrop out along the rope .<ssssss>i be a bit nervous about go farther out , since the powerboat sometimes come in close to the roped-in area , but i notice several people do venture out further.pools ************************************ three pool ; the main pool , a adult pool , and another pool over by build 7 .<ssssss>we do not really spend much time at the pool , with the exception of one afternoon at the main pool .<ssssss>usually a bunch of drinker around the swim-up bar , who seem to get louder and more obnoxious as the afternoon wear on .<ssssss>pool be very clean and well-maintained .<ssssss>entertainment ************************************ the entertainment be hit and miss .<ssssss>due to weather we do not have the weekly beach party , so they seem to put something together on the fly .<ssssss>several of the show be a little racy , and i notice some parent take they kid out at some of the show .<ssssss>the michael jackson show be very entertaining.not bad , but i have see better , although perhaps at larger resort .<ssssss>this be the tail end of the season , and thing might have be wind down.excursions ************************************ do not do any .<ssssss>friend we meet be try to go on the catamaran trip , but after be cancel three day in a row they give up .<ssssss>they say it be cancel due to weather , but i think it be number .<ssssss>would have go on the snorkel trip , but the water be kind of churn up while we be there so decide not to.service ************************************ service be generally good .<ssssss>i tip -lrb- usually $ 1 -rrb- and the server appreciate it , but service be pretty good regardless .<ssssss>some of the bar get very busy , especially the theater bar during a show , but they be pretty efficient.drinks be good , and they will try and mix anything you like .<ssssss>if you ask for it they usually have premium liquor at most of the bar , especially the poolside bar .<ssssss>my wife be not a fan of the local vodka , so i use to ask for the good vodka when order a drink for she , but once the guy get to know I they use to do it automatically .<ssssss>no extra charge , but i use to tip a little bit to whoever be pour the drink .<ssssss>i drink the local liquor and find they to be fine .<ssssss>drink be a little strong sometimes , but they will tone they down if you ask.overall ************************************ we like the place .<ssssss>i would go again .<ssssss>if anyone have any specific question , feel free to email I .<ssssss>
2 3 2 3 2 1 1 -1		the good the bad and the cockroach my husband and myself together with another family stay at the caribe club princess from november 14 , 2008 to november 21 , 2008 .<ssssss>adult age 24-27 and kid 2 and 7 .<ssssss>we book this vacation think that this hotel in fact be a 4 star as represent by sunw vacation .<ssssss>we be very disappointed to discover that this hotel in fact should not be rate as a four star hotel for the follow reason .<ssssss>to commence once we arrive at the hotel we be tell that we room be not ready , fine no problem here as we completely understand that it take time in order for the room to be clean etc. we be tell to return to the front lobby desk at 3pm .<ssssss>at 3pm we return to the lobby desk to be tell that yes be room be ready and that we would be on the first floor .<ssssss>we advise that neither couple would like to stay on the first floor -lrb- we have specifically request a 2nd or 3rd floor room -rrb- and the other couple that travel with we have two small child and didnâ€™t want to stay on the first floor for the fear of have one of they child open the slide door and walk out .<ssssss>while we be await to see if we could be accommodate on a 2nd or 3rd floor we witness a complaint from a couple stay at the tropical princess that they room have be break into via the slide door .<ssssss>they be locate on a first floor room .<ssssss>we then go back to talk to the front lobby reception and be advise that all they could offer we be a room on the first floor and on saturday , the next day , they would move we to another floor .<ssssss>at this point a lady come out and advise the gentleman we be deal with in spanish that he could not offer we those room as those room have â€œproblemsâ€ ?<ssssss>both the gentleman and the lady then disappear and once the come back they tell we that they have find another room for we on the second floor.at this point we be all very happy to know that we could finally go to we room .<ssssss>once we arrive at we room we discover that we have be place on the tropical princess side of the resort when we in fact be book for the caribe club princess side .<ssssss>it be not that this be a big issue but consider the fact that we pay more money to stay at caribe club princess we be very disappointed .<ssssss>we express we concern with the manager of client relation and she advise that at the moment these be the only room available .<ssssss>we agree to stay in these room until the follow day when we be tell something would become available on the caribe club princess side .<ssssss>the other couple travel with we go into they room and we go to do the same .<ssssss>well once i scan my card to be let into the room i discover two naked lady in the room which i have be assign .<ssssss>they didnâ€™t speak a word of english and luckily the manager be still on the premise and i advise she that the front reception have issue I a key for a room that be already assign to someone else .<ssssss>on top of this be unacceptable behavior it be also a great security risk that the hotel doesnâ€™t even know which room they be allot to which people .<ssssss>at this point i be very frustrated and this be not the dream vacation i have envision .<ssssss>i then go to the front reception with my friend and advise they of the trouble .<ssssss>they find other room for we but be unable to explain why the mistake of give I someone elseâ€™s room key happen in the first place .<ssssss>the room we be assign on the tropical princess side be utterly disgusting , they be outdate , the balcony door lock be break and the front door lock have be tamper with .<ssssss>at this point i do not feel safe in the hotel at all but tell myself that it be only for one night until they could place we on the caribe club princess side.the next day we be thankfully as promise move to two room on the caribe club princess side and i start to feel that this vacation be go to be a good one after all .<ssssss>well that be not what happen at all.on tuesday november 18 , 2008 we make a reservation to go to the mamma mia -lrb- italian -rrb- restaurant for dinner with the other couple we be travel with .<ssssss>we arrive at the restaurant and everything be go well and we all order appetizer .<ssssss>everyone except my husband order calamari and my husband order bruschetta .<ssssss>when the appetizer be deliver i see that my husband be stare at he plate .<ssssss>to my disbelief on he plate be a cockroach .<ssssss>i could not believe what i be see .<ssssss>we be stay at a 4 star hotel and my husband be deliver he bruschetta with a cockroach on it .<ssssss>not only be there a cockroach but it be dead with its leg up in the air and appear to have be cook with the cheese on the plate .<ssssss>at this point all of we lose we appetite and get up and leave the restaurant .<ssssss>we call we server to the door and advise he of what have happen .<ssssss>when this happen we could have make a huge scene about it but didnâ€™t want to disgust the other patron in the restaurant .<ssssss>at this point we go to the buffet to have some fruit as we be all starve .<ssssss>after be at the buffet for a little while we be greet by the food and service manager -lrb- milton -rrb- and the chef of the mamma mia restaurant and we be apologize to .<ssssss>we be offer a complimentary dinner at el pescador or la cava because of we worry .<ssssss>we advise that we would think about it and let he know the next day .<ssssss>the next day while we be have breakfast milton approach we and ask if we have make a decision we advise he that we would go to el pescador that same night .<ssssss>that night we go to el pescador but dining at this hotel be not the same for we after we have see the cockroach .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t eat the same and be disgust for the rest of we stay , needless to say that we be not able to eat normally for the rest of the week.on thursday november 20th we be approach by the concierge lady advise that the hotel have be tell of the incident and that the hotel want to offer we a dinner in compensation for what have happen , we advise she that we have already be to a dinner the previous night and that in no way do we feel compensate for what happen nor be we able to enjoy we meal since then .<ssssss>she ask we to please consider this and advise that if we accept this offer we would have to sign a release form which basically state that the dinner be in compensation for the cockroach be on the plate of food and that we be not to make any claim with the hotel , management or tour operator because of the situation that have occur .<ssssss>we advise she that we would not be sign the release form as we feel that everyone include the tour operator should be aware of the type of food that be be serve to people at this hotel .<ssssss>she be not very happy about this.needless to say when friday morning come we be more than happy to be leave this hotel and at the same time very upset that we spend we money go to hotel that be rate four star but yet be serve cockroach with they food.we be very disappoint with all that happen at a time when we be suppose to be rest and on vacation and because of this we will never again visit a princess resort.hope this review help someone realize this be not a sanitary place to be !<ssssss>
3 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		be ok we stay at this hotel for a week over christmas .<ssssss>we find the location very good , great restaurant and bar on third avenue which be a block walk away.the staff be extremely friendly and informative .<ssssss>the room be big but the bathroom be on the small side .<ssssss>we could not help but think that the kitchen be space that could have be but to better use say a bigger bathroom.overall we find we stay at the affinia | dumont to be pleasant but not as good as other hotel we have stay in like omnus berkshire .<ssssss>
3 3 4 2 5 4 4 4		a little far for downtown tourist i book this hotel base on review on tripadvisor .<ssssss>this be my first trip to seattle and i do not mind stay a little out of the way to save some money .<ssssss>however , i be a little confused about the location , because there be to hie hotel on aurora ave. the downtown airporter from seatac will not take you to this one .<ssssss>we get drop off at the 226 aurora location and pay $ 20 for a taxi to this correct location .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very clean and the staff be polite and helpful .<ssssss>my sister and i share a spacious room with 2 queen bed , with a view of downtown and mt. rainier in the distance .<ssssss>we be on the 4th floor and the road noise do not bother we .<ssssss>the front desk provide a ethernet cable to hook up my laptop to the free high-speed internet in the room .<ssssss>breakfast be good and there be plenty of option .<ssssss>there be adequate parking in the lot for we rental car .<ssssss>for go downtown , the bus stop be a 5-minute walk from the hotel , but give yourself plenty of time because it take about 30 minute and do not run on schedule .<ssssss>i recommend have a car for the entire stay or stay closer if you primary goal in seattle be tourism .<ssssss>overall , nothing bad to say about the hotel .<ssssss>we have a good , comfortable stay , though we do not have a chance to take advantage of the indoor pool !<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 5 2 5		great location !<ssssss>.<ssssss>view of the space needle .<ssssss>
5 4 4 5 5 5 5 2		a nearly perfect hotel this be a truly wonderful little hotel and the other review be accurate , but here be some more information .<ssssss>the hotel be under new -lrb- oct 2006 -rrb- management and the new people seem to be just as friendly and helpful as the previous owner .<ssssss>even though it be a small hotel , there be a good-sized elevator !<ssssss>this be really nice when you be on the third floor and you have get lot of heavy luggage .<ssssss>as for complaint - the only big one be that the phone system would not work with we att call card and there be no way around it .<ssssss>since this be a vacation , i be secretly happy about this but it would be hard to stay in the hotel if i be on a business trip .<ssssss>the neighborhood be really nice and close to the museum , tram , and tour boat .<ssssss>the room i share with my wife be small , but that happen in european city .<ssssss>everything be very clean and i be glad we find this hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 3 1 2 2		a glorified business dormitory i stay at the club quarter in boston for two night early in august 2008 .<ssssss>i book my stay at cq as a preferred hotel for my company through orbitz for business , and base my choice on the combination of central location and reasonable rate .<ssssss>in both case , the cq be eminently satisfactory .<ssssss>the hotel provide a clean , reasonably comfortable room for about 60 % of the price of other hotel on we preferred list , and be very central to boston 's financial district.what you will not find at cq be anything resemble a frill .<ssssss>check-in be via a self-service kiosk that do not work at all -lrb- apparently , this be a common event , because the one person who be at the front desk , concierge-like , hover by the check-in kiosk to intercept frustrated guest -rrb- .<ssssss>the lobby be tiny , more like a vestibule -- nicely decorate but cramp .<ssssss>i do not go into the club room off the lobby , but it look nice enough .<ssssss>you gain access to you room by zip you room key in the elevator -- a security feature , i suppose , but i do not feel that insecure in hotel , so to I it be just a pain .<ssssss>my room be on the sixth floor , off a narrow hallway the run through the center of the building -lrb- past , as other have note , a machine that provide chill and filter water -- a nice touch -rrb- .<ssssss>the room itself be small but decently appoint -- somewhat spartan , in the fashion of a mid-seventy college dorm-room that have be gussy up with some designer furniture and finish -- but you could still see its origin in the narrow room , cheap tile , and bath fixture .<ssssss>serviceable , but not cozy or warm .<ssssss>also -- my room face devonshire street , and be moderately noisy all night.overall -- a decent value for the money , well situate , and passably comfortable -- but you will not mistake it for the taj .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		where dream be make .<ssssss>coco loco , have one if you go .<ssssss>.<ssssss>yummmm<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 2 2 -1		good location , but very cold .<ssssss>we stay 3 night at the westin .<ssssss>the location be ideal for tourists.otherwise , the staff be not friendly .<ssssss>the room be ok .<ssssss>generally , the place look very cold and very industrial .<ssssss>
1 4 1 -1 1 -1 2 -1		avoid this hotel !!<ssssss>we stay in this hotel last week .<ssssss>we have two room one double and one triple .<ssssss>the double room have a dirty toilet fill with **** , honestly !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>the triple room have a single bed and two bunk bed leave very small room to unpack luggage etc etc. the room be very small , the wall be very thin any be very close to the central station , train be hear all the time !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>breakfast be decent , staff not so friendly tough eg : barman didnt want to make we a cup of hot water .<ssssss>avoid it .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 2 4 4		great but forget golden visit the gb from june 8 to 15 .<ssssss>most people here have it right , the buffet be good but not 5 star -lrb- i never see good seafood -rrb- , the beach be beautiful -lrb- but nowhere close to varadero cuba -rrb- , the room be well-appointed and the grounds beautiful .<ssssss>some staff be very nice , some do not bother , it be uneven .<ssssss>the drink be so water down my 2 year-old steal a taste of the coco loco and want more !!!!<ssssss>that be how much you do not taste the rum ... too big for I , really , but my toddler love the mini-train so we learn to live with it.that say , one big warning .<ssssss>i do not know what regular booking be like but the royal golden be a major disappointment .<ssssss>we go to the iberostar last year and , in comparison , i do not see any superior service here , certainly not the kind you pay extra for .<ssssss>sure , we be near the beach -lrb- and away from the major construction site next door ! -rrb-<ssssss>, but that be it .<ssssss>restaurant reservation be hard to get and you have to present yourself at the office , could not do it by phone .<ssssss>the safe box be not include .<ssssss>while all golden building be near the beach , the office handle you be at the club house -lrb- as in the other end of the resort -rrb- , where the premium bar sit there among the desk and computer !!!<ssssss>who bother !!!<ssssss>-lrb- honestly , we be not drinker so we do not care but it look ridiculous and gimmicky . -rrb-<ssssss>basically , if you ask I , the royal golden be nothing but a excuse to make you pay for room near the beach , anything else attach to it be par for a 4-5 star hotel , not premium service.i would say , get yourself a good travel agent that can book you close to the sea without go golden , on the side of the property away from construction and you will enjoy and save.would we recommend ?<ssssss>yes .<ssssss>but this be not a 5 star and the swimming be better in cuba .<ssssss>have a good one anyway .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 2 2 3		summer inside my room !<ssssss>.<ssssss>room with a view .<ssssss>.<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 5 -1 3 -1		regular visitor to the moore hotel okay , this be not a glam hotel , but you can not beat the location !<ssssss>there be no bellhop ; the front desk service can be loveable , rude or hard to understand ; and the water pressure be not the greatest .<ssssss>that be the worst of it .<ssssss>what be so great about the moore that i have visit and revisit and be a fan for nearly a decade now ... the price and the location .<ssssss>i do not go to seattle to sit in my hotel room , i visit to walk around , to shop , to drink coffee and to see the water .<ssssss>at the moore , you have it all at you doorstep.when i first start visit , the neighborhood be in desperate need of police surveillance at night .<ssssss>as a single female traveler , i could walk around and feel relatively safe and the front desk keep a good eye on they lobby and the coming and going of they patron .<ssssss>now , the neighborhood immediately outside the door look even safer and more option be available for shopper , diner , beer and cocktail seeker than ever before.best part - you be only two block from the waterfront .<ssssss>request a 6th or 7th floor room face the water and you will enjoy a view that most visitor pay through the nose for .<ssssss>walk to pike place in the morning , shopping at pioneer square in the afternoon , visit nearby belltown at night .<ssssss>walk everywhere .<ssssss>they will hold you luggage for you either before you check-in time or after you have check out but have a few hour to kill before catch you flight .<ssssss>visit the convention center - it be less than 10 minute walk , grab coffee at the french bakery at pike 's place before you head into convention hell.worst part - parking - you have to pay , there be two lot on either side of the hotel or try the bon/macy 's parking lot for something a bit cheaper .<ssssss>oh , and they like to keep you key at the front desk - there be only one key available per room , so if you be share with someone but have different itinerary , make a habit of drop the key off at the front desk .<ssssss>i would trust these people , i once leave a drawerfull of clothes behind and they be kind enough to take care of they until i return the next day , ashamed but extremely grateful.and if you have always want to be a bellboy , there be a couple of luggage cart that you can wheel you stuff about .<ssssss>
3 1 3 -1 3 -1 2 -1		deceptive and dishonest .<ssssss>i be very excite about my stay here , and truthfully , there be thing that we like about this hotel .<ssssss>but beware !!!!<ssssss>when use the online booking system , i do not notice that there be a tab for the number of people .<ssssss>nowhere in the pricing page do it indicate that the price be significantly different when two people be stay in the room -lrb- and it be not as though 2 people to a room be a unusual state of affair . -rrb-<ssssss>i be stay with my partner , and upon check-in , the desk inform we that instead of 190 euro for the room we would be charge 240 euro .<ssssss>i find this to be a outrageous practice , but of course , who want to arrive in a foreign city and start look for a new hotel ?<ssssss>what do we get for 240 euro ?<ssssss>a adequate room with no view whatsoever -lrb- the patio view be another deception : the patio be a concrete pad at the bottom of the light court , and not a patio at all -rrb- , and decent , but not overwhelming , amenity .<ssssss>in fairness , i will say that the rooftop pool and gym be very nice , albeit not as well keep as they could be.all in all , i would say that this be a 3 star hotel charge 5 star rate .<ssssss>it be a shame that gay traveller look for a gay-oriented property can not find something of better value in barcelona .<ssssss>

punta cana .<ssssss>i must tell you first that my kid and i be club med junkie , and this be my 4th trip to punta cana and my only time outside of the club med .<ssssss>the only reason we leave the club med after 5 night be that i would book my trip last fall use aadvantage mile for 11 day , then come to find out afterwards that club med be close because a italian company have rent out the entire place from june 2-7 , right during the last half of my trip .<ssssss>so i be force to find another hotel.after , as usual , a fantastic time at cm , we arrive at the iberostar only to find out that my travel agent have book the iberostar punta cana and not the bavaro as i have request , base on traveller review here .<ssssss>i have read the document and assume that it say iberostar punta cana simply because that be the city it be in .<ssssss>also , i would make the reservation last feb. or so and simply do not remember the name of the other hotel next door when i be send the travel document a few week before departure .<ssssss>my biggest word of advice be to double check this -- a honest mistake make by my travel agent because the name be so innocuous .<ssssss>so , anyway , we arrive only to find out that we be in the other hotel , and by the face of the front desk clerk , which be consider low rent .<ssssss>i ask what the difference in cost be between the two and be tell $ 480 for we 5 night stay base on myself , my 18 yr .<ssssss>old son , and my 14 yr .<ssssss>old son .<ssssss>we ask to see a room , it look fine , and we be tell that the other hotel have much worse room and that you can not use the dining facility at the bavaro if you be stay in the punta cana or dominicana .<ssssss>so i get out my visa card .<ssssss>well , we be take to the other side of the property from where they would show we the sample room .<ssssss>just as close to the beach , and i do not really pay attention to the hammer go on in the group of villa nearby .<ssssss>mistake .<ssssss>every single morning , begin at 8:30 am and last till at least 7:30 pm , there be construction , drilling , hammer so loud you want to scream .<ssssss>it wake we up every morning , even on sunday .<ssssss>the room next to we and below we be also under construction so they start pound at 10 am there , but only on the first 2 day .<ssssss>i would have request a room change except ... i be too busy throw up the 2nd day .<ssssss>yes , after one meal here -lrb- dinner at the buffet -rrb- , i get horrible food poisoning the follow morning , could not leave the room all day , and finally call for a golf cart to take I to the doctor in the other hotel at 6 pm .<ssssss>they be very nice , give I a iv because i be so dehydrated , lot of medicine include some just in case such and such happen , tell I not to pay until i come back the next day -lrb- although they have tell I it would be a $ 90 consultation fee -rrb- .<ssssss>i might point out that they also could not believe it be really food poisoning , suggest that it be from travel , until i point out that i would already be in the dr for 6 day .<ssssss>never once have i get ill at a club med .<ssssss>anyway , so i go back the next morning , feel much better , to get another iv and to pay the bill .<ssssss>i do not need the sos pill , still in they unopened wrapper , for nausea but be unable to give they back as it be against policy from the pharmacy .<ssssss>so ... the grand total come to $ 272 for the hotel give I food poisoning !<ssssss>because it could not be prove , i have no recourse.let 's see , the plus : grounds be very beautiful , beach be beautiful , there be always food somewhere , room fairly spacious .<ssssss>the bartender and waiter be so happy !<ssssss>they be always smlie , singing , and dancing .<ssssss>they be definitely the best part of the place .<ssssss>i do not want you to think i be totally negative ... more minus , however : i have not read that man have to have pants in order to go into the sit-down restaurant .<ssssss>since my son ii 18 , he qualify as a man .<ssssss>well , it be litterally 90 degree and 94 % humidity at that time of year , so we have never bring pants .<ssssss>this be the same place where people be wear bikini without cover-up at lunch !<ssssss>so here we have 2 qualify night for the a la carte restaurant and could not use they .<ssssss>yes , we could have buy he some $ 70 pants in the boutique , but i be pretty feed up about have spend $ 752 by my 2nd day there .<ssssss>we be able to go to the steak restaurant -lrb- the only one where you do not have to wear pants that have table service -rrb- and i could only swallow 2 bite of my rib eye .<ssssss>shoe leather be more tender .<ssssss>i fear the other would be as bad , so i do not bother with the pants.the food be very plentiful , well present , and horrible .<ssssss>again , i hate to compare it to club med , which have fantastic food , but i feel very guilty take food from the buffet and not be able to eat it .<ssssss>some thing be great , but they be few far between .<ssssss>also , they close the beach bar at 6 pm .<ssssss>why?we could not do anything at night because we know that we would be awaken at 8:30 by the construction and , prior to that , the damn peacock screech at 6 am .<ssssss>not that the show be so good that we do not mind leave after 15 min .<ssssss>they be pretty bad.maid service be spotty .<ssssss>i request another pillow and nothing ever show up .<ssssss>i ask again the next day and get it .<ssssss>we 2nd to last day , the maid only give we 2 bath towel .<ssssss>i call for 2 more , and never get they .<ssssss>room service be prompt -lrb- when i could not leave the room , we all have stay in for dinner , not that i eat -rrb- , but the menu be very limited and they do not bring drinks.i take one step class with break down reebok step right on the side of the pool .<ssssss>the teacher have some woman -lrb- guest -rrb- from the u.s. teach it for she , and i do not think she ever teach a class before .<ssssss>plus , the real teacher do not know how to work the music , so we stop after each song .<ssssss>the class last 20 min .<ssssss>because she could not figure out the cd player .<ssssss>it be a blessing to end it , however.last thing : on we day of departure , we be suppose to be in the lobby at 11:35 for we shuttle to the airport .<ssssss>i call for a golf cart to get we luggage that never show up .<ssssss>finally , at 11:30 , my kid and i run with the suitcase only to find out that the bus have leave without we .<ssssss>after much scramble -lrb- we gogo tour rep be , naturally , in the other hotel at this point -rrb- , they find we another tour company 's shuttle who take we to the airport .<ssssss>i see someone there with a iberostar bracelet like ours and ask if they have be on the bus .<ssssss>they say yes , but that the bus have leave early and they have hold it up by get there at 11:30 .<ssssss>let that be another warn to you !<ssssss>they will leave you , even if you be early .<ssssss>if anything , i expect a dominican tour bus to be late , not early .<ssssss>that be fine , i guess , but necessary to know , especially if they just up and leave you.personally , i hate negative review .<ssssss>i like know that the place i want to go to be fantastic , but that be what i be lead to believe by everyone else .<ssssss>wrong .<ssssss>

at the suggestion of many tripadvisor poster we pay the extra $ $ and get the royal service .<ssssss>i do not know if it be worth the extra $ $ because we do not speak with any other who be not in r -lrb- not by choice -rrb- it just seem everyone we run into be in the r area.i will not go into too much detail about the grounds as other have do a great job of that on this site already , sufice it to say , the grounds be spectacular .<ssssss>the pool -lrb- both royal sevice and main pool -rrb- be beautiful , the beach be keep natural and clean -lrb- and many many time we be the only one there so it be private and peaceful as well -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be quite spacious and for the most part comfortable -lrb- more on this later -rrb- the staff we encounter be , mostly , helpful ; of course you will encounter the employee who will not be helpful in any situation this be not the resort fault it just be the way some people be .<ssssss>i will add that tip be definitely expect any and everywhere we go .<ssssss>how much and how often you tip certainly pay a great part in how good you service was.overall , i have no major complaint about the resort staff or grounds .<ssssss>my issue : bath towel - be threadbare and have hole in they on more than one occasion -lrb- i would not have make a point to speak with management for one isolate incident -rrb- in deference to the staff in royal service they attempt to resolve this issue -lrb- i be there when they call -rrb- but two day later nothing have be do the dirty robe be still in we room and the towel with hole be still be place in we room .<ssssss>maybe housekeeping take offense to get a call from royal service ??<ssssss>i do not know but i be sure if the general manager have call this would problem would have be resolve and quickly.sheets - have holesbathrobes-one have a huge coffee stain run up one whole sleeve , the other have numeorus stain all over.nightly turn down service - only happen once during we stay.restaurants-paradisus tout themselves as have 6 restaurant ; of these six there be only two open during the day -lrb- one really and it be buffet -rrb- .<ssssss>this would not be a big deal if you have some variety in the food , but both area -lrb- they be not really separate restaurant but two connected area with different name -rrb- have the same thing day in and day out and it be usually pick over and poorly present .<ssssss>i swear if i have to eat fried chicken one more time i be go to cluck !<ssssss>there be no variety even for dessert , flan , chocolate cake , ice cream.evenings be not that much better - romantico we eat here two time during we stay not so much becasue the food be good but because the other choice bamboo be so bad -lrb- more on this later -rrb- .<ssssss>avocado - -lrb- which actually have good food -rrb- , be only open twice during we stay -lrb- and we be not able to get in the first day because they be book .<ssssss>all the restaurant be supposedly book yet we see 10 table at romantico sit empty for over two hour while we have we dinner .<ssssss>this be not count the table that be leave uncleaned throughout the night .<ssssss>and yes romantico be book the night we be there .<ssssss>bamboo-was a bad hibachi experience which might have be save if the staff at bamboo have offer some information on the sushi and appetizer available in the other room -lrb- even though we and another couple wait 45 + minute at we table with nothing to eat before we show begin -rrb- .<ssssss>i believe i see dessert on the menu but i could not tell you anything about they because after wait 1/2 hour after we meal no one come to ask if we want any we all leave .<ssssss>poor restaurant management ?<ssssss>maybe , sneaky expense management ?<ssssss>more likely.my observation be that corner be be cut in the food department and many many people be unhappy about it .<ssssss>unfortunately , none of the people i ask with say they have or plan to complain .<ssssss>the staff be without a clue , ask 5 of they what restaurant be open on any give day result in 5 different answer -lrb- sadly all wrong -rrb- .<ssssss>spa-overpriced for the service which be ho hum , nothing to write home about but certainly nothing to complain about .<ssssss>again tip be defintely expectedcar rental - we reserve a car week before we arrive , we check once at the resort on monday she confirm that she indeed have we reservation for the thursday return to the airport .<ssssss>on the wednesday we go to the avis counter to check on we car -lrb- we have nothing to do -rrb- only to find out that they have no car for we becasue they be short in sju airport so they take all the vehicle .<ssssss>now we be strand !<ssssss>the only suggestion teh woman have be that she could refer we to a local rental agency but they only have one location so we would have to bring it back to they !<ssssss>so what good be this do we !<ssssss>upon bring this to the attention of royal service staff i be tell that for $ 60 they could have the shuttle bring we to the airport to pick up a car .<ssssss>so now we have to pay $ 60 on top of the $ 60 per day the car be cost we just to leave this place !<ssssss>the least the should have do be to comp we the shuttle to the avis counter at the airport .<ssssss>my biggest complaint ?<ssssss>lack of response from sr. management these issue mention above could have easily be resolve by the manager whom we attempt to speak with on several occasion to no avail .<ssssss>it be so surprising to I that a hotel general manager would ask to hear they guest ' comment and even take the time to respond to these tripadvisor review but when present with the opportunity to resolve a valid issue first hand before it get to a review point ; can be so totally clueless .<ssssss>have mr lapp take the ten minute or to speak with we and listen to what we have to say i be sure he would have feel as do he other management personnel -lrb- who do attempt to to resolve these issue to no avail -rrb- that this be not acceptable anywhere in the world but even less in a alleged 5 * resort .<ssssss>we pay good money to stay here , we be ask for nothing more than what we pay for , the quality be be promise and the quantity be be promise ; 6 restaurant , clean robe non threadbare towel and sheet with no hole .<ssssss>we be not look to get more than we pay for , but we be certainly look to get what we be promise !<ssssss>beware if you choose to stay here , bring lot of $ $ for tip and you own robes/towels .<ssssss>

1 3 2 5 2 2 1 -1		i really want to like it i love to stay in small-scale , modest inn and consider myself to be tolerant of a bit of grottiness , minimal service , noise , etc. ... be a seattle native and uw alum , i have want to try the college inn for year .<ssssss>i be thus so very inclined to like this place -- but come away with a combination of anger , disappointment , and the decision not to return .<ssssss>here 's why : -- this place be not clean where it matter .<ssssss>the blanket on my bed stank of some other person 's perfume or deoderant -- very distinctive , not a aftersmell of detergent .<ssssss>if they wash the blanket at all , they do not do a very good job .<ssssss>-- the shower drain be badly plug up , so that within a few seconds i be stand in my own wastewater , which , of course , then slosh together with the remains of other people 's shower -- ugh , i do not want to go on think about that ... -- i be promise a double room and receive a twin room -lrb- two twin bed -rrb- .<ssssss>this be after have book well ahead of time and get both a phone and email confirmation of this .<ssssss>they be completely full and since we be stay for only one night , i have a strong suspicion that we be give whatever be leave over .<ssssss>i also know that they have switch room on we at some late point b/c i have receive a call from chris , the manager , give I the room number and tell I that since we be arrive late in the p.m. to get buzz up and just go straight to that room which would be unlock .<ssssss>on arrival i find that the door be lock -lrb- i probably disturbed whoever be there by try the knob -rrb- , and i have to buzz the staff who live upstairs to let I into the room that they have set aside for I -- a different one from what i be originally promise .<ssssss>-- the next morning , when i mention the room switch , the manager do not at all appear surprised or concerned .<ssssss>he say that it should not have happen but he statement that it should not happen again be not at all convincing .<ssssss>-- website be dishonest : under parking it say , saturday and sunday free parking one-half block away on a space-available basis .<ssssss>when i call to get direction to this free parking area i be tell that it be between 42nd and 43rd on brooklyn -- which be more like 5 block away from the inn .<ssssss>we be walker , so nbd , but this seem to I to be indicative of a tendency to paint a rosier picture than what actually exist .<ssssss>-- have have a difficult day of travel and get only 5 hour of sleep , the next morning i make the error of leave a clothing item in the room .<ssssss>two day later , i realize that it be miss and i work hard to follow up with the staff there to locate it .<ssssss>i leave a message , call back when i do not get the courtesy of a return call , stop by in person to inquire , speak with joe -lrb- i think that be he name -rrb- as well as dean .<ssssss>i get a couple of assurance that i will receive a call back -- they say they have to check with housekeeping .<ssssss>even with my repeat call , include a angry final call that get I the assurance that chri would call I back the next day , nobody ever bother to phone I , even to tell I that the item go miss .<ssssss>my guess be that this have happen before , so no big deal from they perspective , and that in my case the housekeeping staff know someone who could use my clothing item.the only positive comment i will make be a heartfelt one -- but it be not about the inn , it be about the college inn pub downstairs .<ssssss>the place be friendly and have a excellent choice of ale .<ssssss>scruffy and real , if you be a beer enthusiast and be after authenticity instead of hype and polish , i would really recommend the pub .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 1 4 4		very good hotel a trip to boston for the 4th july firework mean a chance to spend a night in one of my most frequented hotel , the hilton at boston logan airport.for convenience this hotel be hard to beat .<ssssss>whilst not in the downtown area , for business traveller , or those with early or late flight , you can not beat the location .<ssssss>physically connect to terminal a and e , the hotel also offer a courtesy shuttle , which also drop and pick up at the t subway station for the city.i use hilton 's online check in system so i know i have a upgrade room .<ssssss>arrive at check in there be a lengthy line , but the hhonor line be clear so i join that , only to be consistently ignore by staff and barge out of the way by non-hhonors member .<ssssss>i get zero benefit from use online check in or the hhonor priority line , so i have to ask what the benefit of these service be if a hotel ignore they ... but that be the only flaw with the stay .<ssssss>the room in the hilton be nice .<ssssss>all have view , some of the airport which be surprisingly interesting , and on this occasion for , a view across the airport to the city sklyine .<ssssss>a great vantage point for the firework display , enhance by the presence of the queen mary 2 in the harbour.rooms be clean , bathroom good , and the new flatscreen tv 's be very good .<ssssss>my only criticism with the room be that they appear to have remove the mini-bar .<ssssss>wifi internet access be available , and seem quick and stable .<ssssss>the exec lounge be good , offer a reasonable conteninental breakfast and again have superb view over the harbour.check out be painless , the bill accurate and every member of staff i meet courteous and polite .<ssssss>i would have rate at 5 star if not for the check in experience .<ssssss>

3 4 3 3 2 1 3 4		great for no-frills traveler on a budget my husband and i stay at the college inn while visit seattle for 6 day in april 2007 .<ssssss>we already know that it be a dorm-style establishment with a shared bathroom down the hall , so we come prepare with we own robe and shower shoes.our major problem with the inn be that my husband have be tell when he make the reservation that it would be possible to check in before 3 p.m. the website state that no one be in the office until then and the front door be lock ; visitor must be buzz in to check in and be then give a key to the front door .<ssssss>as i say , we be tell that they could make arrangement for we to check in early .<ssssss>we arrive at the inn around 12:30 p.m. , luggage in tow and exhaust , only to find that no one be there .<ssssss>we try buzz and call but there be no answer .<ssssss>we drug we luggage into the tiny cafe downstairs and have a bite to eat and then sit on a bench for a while until we see someone inside the entryway to the inn .<ssssss>lucky for we that we see they , as we be allow to stow we luggage in the office for a few hour , but we still could not check in until 3 p.m. i understand that that be they state policy , but they should not have tell we that we could get in earlier if it be not true .<ssssss>so be warn , do not expect to get into the building before 3 p.m. , no matter what they tell you !!!<ssssss>my only other gripe with the inn be minor .<ssssss>while there be a small chest of drawer in we room , there be very few hanger and no closet .<ssssss>they could definitely stand to have some more hanger available .<ssssss>also , there be one shared iron board and iron that be keep upstairs ; you have to go up to the 4th floor lounge/office and ask for it .<ssssss>the iron be ancient and completely empty.the room itself , however , be fine .<ssssss>the bed be no more or less comfortable than any other standard hotel bed .<ssssss>the sink in the room be definitely helpful , since the bathroom down the hall could get a little crowded depend on the time of day .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be great , definitely better than any standard breakfast at a major hotel chain .<ssssss>and from what i saw , the staff be very helpful in assist traveler navigate they way around the city or suggest thing to see .<ssssss>we hear other traveler complain about noise , but we do not experience any of the problem with loud neighbor or noise from the pub downstairs.for we need , the college inn serve we well .<ssssss>for anyone on a budget just look for a decent place to sleep -lrb- and get a nice breakfast -rrb- , i would definitely recommend this place .<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 5 5 4 4		okay stay if i could give the hotel 3.5 star , i would , but i will err on the side of caution .<ssssss>i pay about $ 125/night after tax for room 132 , all the way in the back of the hotel on the first floor.pros : very professional and helpful staff -lrb- have map print for each desination that i inquire about -rrb- with a 24 hour desk , nice property , nice , clean pool , large enough grounds to not feel crowded even when the hotel be full .<ssssss>the hotel restaurant -lrb- blue iguana ? -rrb-<ssssss>get some flack in previous review -- while i would not call it authentic , the price be decent and the food always fill , not to mention the convenience of have a place to get some quick food right in the hotel .<ssssss>good-sized room , well-kept property .<ssssss>convenient to seven sea beach and highway 3 to get to el yunque/any point south.cons : i be generally not a picky hotel customer , but for the price , there be several small problem that i might have ignore have the hotel be cheaper .<ssssss>door to the outside be leave open at all hour of the day , and clean staff leave the room door open while cleaning -- this result in a army of mosquito in the room each night , and fresh bite each morning .<ssssss>bathroom have a slight smell , maybe mold .<ssssss>the door/lock be smaller than the frame , which lead to a bang sound all night long as the door rattle with the breeze -- to accompany the knock sound in the a/c .<ssssss>two day into the trip we card randomly do not work for the room , although the desk be quick to replace they .<ssssss>in a effort to tidy up the room , the housekeeping staff occasionally stick thing in random drawers/out of sight , which mean some hunting around to find things.all in all , as a bargain traveler , i might look for a cheaper hotel next time instead of pay for the nice facility , which we rarely use -lrb- there be too much else to do ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>if you be look for a more relax vacation where you plan to spend a bulk of you time at the hotel , or for a extended business stay , this be probably a suitable place .<ssssss>

2 2 4 3 4 1 3 -1		way to big just back from punta cana at the bahia .<ssssss>never again would i travel to this resort , after arrive 45 minute early we be tell that all we room key have just be ship to the airport so we would have to wait until they return with they .<ssssss>due to a medical condition we ask for a room closer to either the pool or beach , we even fax in the request 2 week prior to get there .<ssssss>we think they look for the room farthest from either of these and it take 3 day to get it change .<ssssss>i have to agree with bellamelissa in the previous review that the food really suck .<ssssss>my wife live on egg and pasta pretty much all week .<ssssss>the beach and pool be pack at a early hour with towel on all the lounge chair , but no people and if you watch some of those towel never even move all day .<ssssss>this resort be 5 resort in 1 so it be pretty segregate if you a high end payer you can go anywhere and if you a low end be prepare for use only 2 out of 5 pool and half of food establishment .<ssssss>some of the staff be very helpful but most really be not try to pass the buck to someone else .<ssssss>the cleaning staff do do a good job though they be always clean .<ssssss>so all say we time there be alright but never would i reccomend this resort as it be to big and as i understand it be even expand again to well over 2000 room .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 4 3 3		great location poor food noisy room the hotel have a terrific location , and the building and decor be superb .<ssssss>we room be rather small , and almost windowless -lrb- just a very small window at one end -rrb- and whilst the bathroom be excellent , the room itself attract all the corridor noise - especially tiresome when -lrb- after we 12 hour flight -rrb- the domestic staff start loudly and energetically clean the room at 7.15 am .<ssssss>the staff be pleasant and helpful , but the breakfast , although abundant , be poorly maintain - hot item eg.scrambled eg , bacon etc. be leave to go cold , and bread be leave to go stale .<ssssss>worse , room service deliver exceptionally poor food - salad that have obviously sit for hour , fish that be old and oily , stale roll , and a inedible hamburger .<ssssss>the cuisine of this hotel be distinctly poor , and more attention should be pay to sound proof the room .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 4 2 -1		small , small , small it be not often that i be disappointed after follow the advice give on tripadvisor but i suppose in some way , read between the line , i be warn .<ssssss>the location of the hotel next to london bridge station be fine , it be in a great part of london , the stunning borough market be on the doorstep and transport link be good .<ssssss>we book a standard room -lrb- mistake -rrb- and it cost considerably more than a executive room at the victoria park plaza that beat the lbh hand down .<ssssss>the entrance area of the hotel be fine , there be a small open plan bar/lobby and i come across one smiley and gush trainee receptionist , as for the stunning staff highlight in other review , they fail to materialise .<ssssss>even though warn , i be not quite expect the miniscule standard bedroom we be allocate .<ssssss>its one saving grace be the comfortable king size bed .<ssssss>other than that it be very , very compact with too much furniture and little room to move .<ssssss>the bathroom be more 3 * than 4 * but the shower be very powerful and the towel be large .<ssssss>the shampoo/conditioner be not renew for the second night but in fairness , the room and bathroom be clean .<ssssss>i go to get the paper in the morning and think i would read it in the lobby as the room be too small to be comfortable but that be shortlive as the cleaner put the hoover on next to I and start to clean around my feet.the quality of the breakfast be good but the breakfast staff find it almost impossible to cope when it get busy .<ssssss>there be queue to get in for breakfast and large queue for the hot food .<ssssss>the restaurant be small and many table be too crowd together , the extension dining area be more canteen than restaurant .<ssssss>i can forgive bacon , scramble egg , tomato etc run out once but this be a regular occurence on both day and clearly this need close attention - the staff be snappy when ask how long -lrb- often at least 10 minute -rrb- replacement would be and this take the edge off what be otherwise quality food .<ssssss>the overall impression be small room , small breakfast room , small lobby/bar and generally a rather frustrating experience .<ssssss>if you book a executive room it be probably fine but beware a superior room as the receptionist tell I it be the same size as ours but with a smaller bed !!<ssssss>the question be ` would i stay at this hotel again or recommend it to other ? '<ssssss>sadly , the answer be no as there be much better hotel at much better price .<ssssss>why be this rate 6th out of more than 1000 hotel in london - be i miss something ??<ssssss>
2 1 4 3 5 5 5 3		nice hotel but in it for the money i be just come to the end of a stay at this hotel for the ibm websphere conference .<ssssss>first impression be that it be a impressive building -lrb- with the lobby full building height and the room balcony off it and a glass walled lift -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be very nice , with a large bed and sofa , as well as the usual office area for work in the evening .<ssssss>tv be replace with a trendy lcd one during my stay there .<ssssss>bathroom be ok -lrb- though mine have crack glass in the door divide the toilet area from the bath area and a crack sink , which you would not expect from a 5 * hotel.nice live piano music echo 's up the structure to the room in the evening which be nice too.however all this be spoil for I by the hotel agressive money focus .<ssssss>even with we conference bulk book reduction the price be 240e a night -lrb- bed and buffet breakfast -rrb- , which in it be self be not too bad for a five star hotel , however they seem to have manage to exclude absolutely everything from this .<ssssss>- on arrival i be shock there be no tea and coffee .<ssssss>.<ssssss>and not even a bottle of water to drink or a biscuit .<ssssss>have i want to pay 5e i could have have a small 250ml bottle of water from the fridge .<ssssss>- should i want a twix i could pay 7e yes 7e -lrb- 1000 % mark up -rrb- .<ssssss>i instead pay 22e for a disgusting raw burger with fries -lrb- the fries be good -rrb- .<ssssss>- my friend could not get a iron to iron she shirt because they insist you use they iron service , which cost more than the shirt .<ssssss>- a film on the tv cost 14e - swimming be include but on the third day of swim i be tell i must buy a swim hat at 6e which they insist on cash for and would not put on my room .<ssssss>i have not bring cash funnily enough because they will not let guest have a key to a locker without become a yearly member of the leisure club .<ssssss>you have to take you clothes and leave they pool side .<ssssss>shameful .<ssssss>- after all this price stress you might like to unwind with a dip in the jaccuzi/hot tub by the pool .<ssssss>but this be not include you would have to pay another 20e to use this.i be still here at the moment but i sudder in fear at what they will have charge I per toilet flush or for each breath of air.i stay in various 5 * hotel but expect at least some of the basics to be include .<ssssss>my company give we a daily allowance for food etc on top of the room rate .<ssssss>we can not expense everything like some people can .<ssssss>.<ssssss>so this be totally unacceptable .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 1 3 3 3		delle nazioni not great while this hotel be close to the train station and therefore easily accesible , it have very dirty room .<ssssss>first , the good ... they provide a decent breakfast in a clean area that also have a small patio you could sit at , they also have a small -lrb- 5 computer -rrb- internet cafe that be free of charge , and the hotel staff be very friendly and informative .<ssssss>now , for the bad ... the room that we be provide be a very small room stick in the corner of some small hallway .<ssssss>it look out over a what could only be compare to a elevator shaft .<ssssss>the room have water mark on the ceiling , mold in the shower , and the carpet be filthy .<ssssss>the bathroom provide a shower , but it be only a drain in the corner of the room with a curtain around it , very small and no where to put you shampoo , soap , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the room smell musty and mildewy -lrb- my clean clothes still smell of the room when i return to the state -rrb- .<ssssss>the linen be clean , but smell of vinegar .<ssssss>i do notice there seem to be a section of the hotel that be towards the front that appear to have nicer hallway carpet and room , but what we be provide do not live up to the 3.5 rating this hotel recieve .<ssssss>would not stay here again .<ssssss>

4 4 2 5 3 5 4 -1		nice but .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i book a 3 night stay at the fairmont , look for a upscale 5 star hotel .<ssssss>after my stay , some expection be meet , other be not .<ssssss>the fairmont be a real 5 star hotel in many thing but some aspect let the expernece fall down.the building be nearly at the top of nob hill , offer wonderful sight on san francisco.at my arrival immediataly 2 member of the staff be ready to open taxi 's door and take the luggage out of the car ; they give I a card in order to take my suitcase back after the check-in .<ssssss>the lobby be not huge but spectacular , one of the best i ever see : floor and colum full of marble , beautifiul ceiling and carpets.due to a misunderstanding between the hotel and my travel agency , my booking -lrb- 2 queen size bed room -rrb- be transorm into a king size bed room .<ssssss>because there be not other 2 queen bed room available , i be upgrade to a larger room with a partail view of tha bay in which they place a rollaway bed.the check-in be anyway fast , then a bell-boy immediatelky take we luggage to the room.lifts and corridor be nothing special compare to the lobby ; the size of the room be quiet good -lrb- about 30 sq. mt -rrb- : there be a very comfortable king size bed in the middle , a lcd flat screen -lrb- 37 or 40 -rrb- , some lamp and 2 armchair .<ssssss>there be a small marble bathroom -lrb- product 's bathroom be miller harris -rrb- and a big closet.the room -lrb- located in the old palace -rrb- be full of contradiction : beutiful lamp but and old armchair , marble bathroom but a old bathtub , a beautiful bed and a lcd tv but old and not very clean curtains.and this be the feeling i have during my whole stay.every morning they leave in front of my door a copy of the we today.on one day of my stay , sf authority have plan to simulate a huge nuclear attack in sf 's downtown .<ssssss>the evening before , hotel staff inform I about this event with a very detailed letter describe this training -lrb- in the letter there be even the street that would have be close -rrb- .<ssssss>a nice and useful touch.staff confirm they skill when i inform a guy about a stain on the rollaway bed 's sheet .<ssssss>i wrongly think he be a member of the housekeeping but i do not need to call housekeeping to let the sheet change : this guy -lrb- probably a hotel 's supplier -rrb- inform directly hotel staff.the hotel offer two great restaurant option : the famous tonga room and a restaurant adjiacent to the lobby that , as the latter , have amazing wall , furniture and ceiling.since electronic check-out be not available on my departure date , i check out at the front desk and they take I off the rollaway bed cost -lrb- 90 $ -rrb- .<ssssss>another nice touch i really appreciate .<ssssss>i think one of the basic 5 star hotel guest ' expectation after pay a lot of money for a room be not to find a hotel where everyone seem to be ready to charge everything -lrb- another example of this king be the minibar that be not , luckily , a electronic one .<ssssss>at the check-out i be happy to hear again after a long time the question do you take something from the minibar ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>and finally here be the issue i find that do not allow I to describe my fairmont experience like a five star one : 1 .<ssssss>my room be not absolutely soundproofed .<ssssss>always , especially in the early morning , i could hear from my bed many terrrible and very noisy door 's slam .<ssssss>this be really annoying and out of standar for a luxury hotel .<ssssss>2 .<ssssss>something look old and not be subject to the recent restructuring : one the left carpet of the lobby there be a big rip , like on a sheet of my bed .<ssssss>and , as i write before , corridor , lift and moquette be not in line with the beauty of the lobby.all in all , the fairmont sf have all the feature in order to be a amazing hotel : beautiful building and common area , and a very skilled staff .<ssssss>they just need to bring to higher level all the detail i describe .<ssssss>so probably , actually at the fairmoint 's rate , it be possible to find something better in sf .<ssssss>

3 3 4 2 5 1 1 2		fairly average !!!<ssssss>we stay here for two night as part of we globus tour .<ssssss>although the hotel room be extremely beatuiful and new , if you ever need anything from the hotel staff , include reception and restaurant , dont bother ask for help .<ssssss>the staff be extremely rude and arrogant , even if you speak to they in italian .<ssssss>the buffet breakfast be fairly average , i have have better at a 3 star hotel .<ssssss>the hotel be not centrally located , although its only about 20 min from the city and will cost you about 18-20euro one way by taxi , which seem to be the only way to get there .<ssssss>if you want to book here for they advertised whirlpool , dont , as you have to pay 12euro per person to use the pool .<ssssss>i have never ever have to pay extra for a swimming pool , especially at a hilton or well know hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 3 -1 2 -1 1 -1		definitely not a class act as you can probably tell , we be not impressed .<ssssss>despite some of the negative review , i be impressed that my e-mail to the resort to the spa be answer the same day .<ssssss>however , once we arrive we find good service to be a rarity , especially in the restaurant .<ssssss>the maid service , the bar the mini-bar refill be great , but we want to eat too.the buffet for breadkfast lunch , better have a camel if you want something other than coffee to drink .<ssssss>napkin , you be extremely lucky if they be on the table when you sit down and it be never go to happen that you would have water and a napkin when you come back from the buffet .<ssssss>the best service be in the oceana the grille for both lunch dinner .<ssssss>we be in the french restautant -lrb- after a 30 minute wait to get in and -rrb- after 15 more minute wait for someone to come ask for we drink order , when they let another couple in who complain about the wait with empty table sit there in .<ssssss>well they do not get any better service inside.we go to the asian resaurant and be seat by the manager of all the restaurant , who neglect to give we the menu , class act i think not .<ssssss>why be we pay more to stay here then any other place in pc.we have stay at other all-inclusive -lrb- adult only , in the dr other island -rrb- there be some good point but the atmosphere , quality service at secret be lack , we will not be back .<ssssss>ps i do habla un pequito de espanol , so it be not the language .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 2 4 4 1		great staff , old and tired room great staff but ... as a hyatt gold card member , and for the cost , and because of the website 's photo ... we expect something more upscale .<ssssss>bed , pillow sheet be great , the room be very old very tired .<ssssss>the curtain be so full of moth-hole , the light shone right through !<ssssss>the carpet next to the wall be thick with dust -lrb- where a regular upright vacuum can not reach -rrb- .<ssssss>the air conditioner rattle like a old car .<ssssss>the bedside lamp blink like a strobe .<ssssss>the slide glass door -lrb- that be suppose to open 4 inch for fresh air -rrb- be duct-taped shut , with duct tape all over the handle .<ssssss>the wallpaper be begin to peel in the bathroom -lrb- why have wallpaper in a bathroom ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the battery in the keyboard have run flat .<ssssss>the message light blink and blink , even though we do not have message .<ssssss>when we first arrive , we call the front desk the engineer be call to fix the a/c .<ssssss>when we come back after shopping , it still be not do find the light do not work , so he have to come back to fix both .<ssssss>it take a while -lrb- in the morning -rrb- to come see what be wrong with the keyboard , then to get new battery .<ssssss>it would have be great to have thing check out before we get to the room !<ssssss>simple enough to run check on these thing after the room be clean and before the customer arrive ?<ssssss>some clever person have discover that because of the system employ in the minibar , if you put back a empty pringle or soda can , it look like somebody 's replace it , you do not get charge !<ssssss>for hyatt 's price , i actually do not blame them!the group next door come in at about 2am , slam door , then be up again make a racket at 7am .<ssssss>why not have the honeymooner in one area leave these noisy group of business people next door to each other in another ?<ssssss>it be not as though we have a great view!wish i have take photo , but this be my first anniversary of marriage , and it be just too depressing .<ssssss>and on top of all this , i contact the hyatt gold passport rep who write to we , ask we to contact he if we need anything ... he have now receive two email from I have yet to respond !<ssssss>give the nice staff a hotel that they can be proud of !<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 2 1 5 -1		not up to standard of a ritz this hotel while be a ritz carlton do not meet my expectation .<ssssss>what set a great hotel apart from a good hotel be the thing that you do not see but come up and surprise you .<ssssss>maybe its the economy but all the extra you expect from a ritz or four season be not there .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and will help with any situation but the overall feel be not great .<ssssss>as this be we first stay , i ask many people who have be go there for many year , and almost all say what i feel and many say that they would not return .<ssssss>the room be fine -lrb- that be after we be move from we room as there be mold under the window and on the carpet ... gross -rrb- .<ssssss>internet be very spotty .<ssssss>what amaze we be that we be tell that the hotel be full yet not all the restaurant be open .<ssssss>be sure to book they ahead of time and stay far away from mare the seafood restaurant .<ssssss>price be very inflate as it be a ritz , but come on 18 for a pool side hot dog and 22 for a pool side ceasar salad with chicken ?<ssssss>the magic question be would i return ... the answer be no .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 3 3 -1		central location , good city break hotel we stay here for 2 night in mid june when the weather be a little cold .<ssssss>the hotel room be very clean and modern , and the bathroom be a generous size compare to other italian hotel we have stay in .<ssssss>the hotel be very close to the dome and main train station , which make the hotel a good choice for a short break .<ssssss>i would describe the hotel as a good city break hotel but not sure i would recommend it for longer stay .<ssssss>i be a little disappointed with the breakfast as it be a little limited .<ssssss>the actual breakfast area be quite small , there be only a handful of table inside and fewer outside on the rooftop , so in proportion the buffet food area be quite small .<ssssss>the hotel also have a cafe restaurant next door within the same building , good for a quick lunch .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 2 3 3 1		a expensive backpacker not a boutique hotel this be not a boutique hotel , but a good backpacker .<ssssss>the ` deluxe ' room for a $ 185 be laughable , the only reason we do not walk out be that there be literally no other accommodation available .<ssssss>the problem be -lrb- i -rrb- room smell , -lrb- ii -rrb- window fithly , -lrb- iii -rrb- cigarette burn in bedspread , -lrb- iv -rrb- fan in bathroom do not work , -lrb- v -rrb- apart from soap no tolietry provide -lrb- vi -rrb- the room 's layout extremely awkward with cheap ottoman , furniture and tv set and worst of all the noise from george st. horrific , especially with the window open if you want fresh air .<ssssss>although , the staff be friendly .<ssssss>
5 4 4 5 5 5 5 2		very nice hotel with a excellent location this hotel be very conveniently located to the plaza del sol , museum , and other attraction .<ssssss>if you have only one night to stay in madrid as i do , it be perfect .<ssssss>the staff be friendly , there be a shuttle that can take you to the airport , and there be a breakfast option .<ssssss>i would stay there again if i be to come through madrid .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 3 3 4		clean , comfortable and central , but something miss we stay at the jazz last week , and can not fault the cleanliness andcomfort of the room .<ssssss>also enjoy the room service pizza , which be deliver promptly .<ssssss>however we do feel that this hotel be slightly soulless , and a few extra touch might go a long way towards make guest feel more welcome .<ssssss>for example a complimentary bottle of wateron arrival would i feel be appreciate by many guest who have endureda long journey .<ssssss>we have receive -lrb- and now come to expect this -rrb- in many hotel of a lower rating , and these extra touch really do make a difference .<ssssss>we also find the general ambiance in the public area around reception bit too stark and unwelcoming .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 5 5 3		really like it .<ssssss>this be my first trip to barcelona , and i have no idea what to expect .<ssssss>i be extremely pleased .<ssssss>the hotel be clean , which be a absolute must for I .<ssssss>the staff be very helpful .<ssssss>-lrb- perhaps it help that i can speak spanish -rrb- .<ssssss>my husband and i be not disappoint .<ssssss>we be please by the location because it be so near to las ramblas , but far enough that we do not have to deal with city noise .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 5 2 3 5		fabulous view , ok service i stay at the harbor court for business in july 2008 .<ssssss>now let I start by say that i be not a inexperienced visitor to san francisco .<ssssss>i think this be important only because the room rate tend to be expensive in this city and you tend to end up with a small amount of square footage for what you pay.my first problem with the hotelm begin before i ever check in .<ssssss>i have reserve a room for one night and my plan change and i call to extend the stay .<ssssss>my rate be $ 135 so i call the hotel to check in one day earlier and be quote a rate of $ 299 .<ssssss>i immediately hope onto expedia with whom i have originally make the review and they have a rate of $ 135 for the same room .<ssssss>i tell this to the person on the phone and they indicate they would match it if they could also find this rate .<ssssss>ten minute latter they honor the rate of $ 135 .<ssssss>moral of the story , although the kimpton website say they gaurentee the best rate ... shop around.upon arrive at the hotel no one be out front to offer to help with the bag , although this may seem like a nit , in san francisco when travel by yourself you need somone to get the bag and take the car so you can check in without get a ticket.upon checking in i be tell that i would need to get new key the nnext day as i have two seperate reservation ... although not the end of the world , it be not convenient when stay more than one day since i have to expense all of travel back to my company i have twice the number of receipt that i needed.the room be nice -lrb- small , but again this be sf -rrb- but the view be amazing !<ssssss>if you stay she request the view room which have amazing view of the bay bridge and the island!service be luke warm the entire visit , depend on the website you look at they will give from 3.5 - 4 star ... my experience have be that service be better at some of the other chain hotel properties.this hotel be good for business travel if you stay involve business soma or the financial district -lrb- near the embarcadero -rrb- any further than that and this property will be too far we of the way .<ssssss>holiday visitor would be better to stay closer to union square or the warf as this be where you will most likely spend you time.i think this hotel count too much on the location , and do not have enough substance to make it 4 star .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 5 5 3		.<ssssss>.<ssssss>i miss it already !!!!<ssssss>we arrive in bali have fly via kualar lumpur .<ssssss>it be a long flight but if you fly with a good airline they do all they can to make it bearable!we be suppose to go to bali for we honeymoon but could not due to the close timing of the incident in kuta .<ssssss>however , i be kind of glad we do not as we have the most incredible trip in the end , which i doubt nowhere could match ... however , bali be a amzaing place , inexpensive , safe , friendly , beautiful , but the hotel be albeit very nice and the garden superb .<ssssss>i find the room to be a little old particularilly the bathroom !<ssssss>however , this be in some way make up by have a room with a balcony over the regency lounge where live balineese music would be play in the evening .<ssssss>.<ssssss>magical !<ssssss>the pool be lovely , but feel due to the surround tree and flower the ` green ' pool could have be clean more often throughout the day .<ssssss>the overall design of the garden and pool be wonderful , and the beach -lrb- at high tide -rrb- be lovely , but low tide be not a post card pitcure .<ssssss>although you can see the most sacred mountain from the beach .<ssssss>when the tide be out you can walk out into the weed and see the largest star fish i have ever see ... up to 30cm in diameter !<ssssss>there do not appear to be anything nasty in the seaweed , but would suggest wear rubber shoe if you want to go out far !!!<ssssss>the hyatt have a lovely reception , greet you with flower , music and a cold drink .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be great and we look forward to the fresh fruit and pastry daily .<ssssss>however , the price of food and drink in the hotel be outrageous .<ssssss>we do not eat once there for dinner .<ssssss>there be so many very nice restaraunt in sanur .<ssssss>recommend ming the village i be amaze that these restaraunt manage to produce western food to a high standard , but of course they own cuisine be excellent too , but sometine you get a little fed up with the hot stuff .<ssssss>the fish in and around bali be the best , exquisitte and would also recomment the wantillian on the beach , walk along the beach path -lrb- leave out ot the hyatt -rrb- anfd you will find table on the sand , live music and the fish catch that day on the menu ... lovely.we do not explore enough of balus , and do want to return .<ssssss>i would go back to the hyatt as sanur have a good balance in term of tourist etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the hyatt be suppose to be the best hotel in sanur and we certaily do not see any other to question that .<ssssss>taxi be very cheap ... you have 2 kind one be a van with bench seat which be very cheap , but would only use those to go up and down sanur .<ssssss>otherwise the taxi be good and also inexpensive we go to kuta 3 or 4 time at a cost of 40,000 rupiah -lrb- about Â£2 .50 -rrb- each way.bali be safe enough to travel around without a guide , the people be so spiritually guide they dare not commit crime nor offend anyone , quite a change from most place in the world .<ssssss>avoid go with the fix tour agent tour , unless you be prepare to only be take to pre-arranged shop etc where pricre be far higher -lrb- due to intro commission etc -rrb- bali be fabulous and have never feel so much at peace , and this be down to the kindness of it be people ... you must go !<ssssss>the temple be like nothing i have ever see ... i have get to go back and explore the west !<ssssss>
1 2 1 2 2 1 1 4		motel , not hotel this hotel be not what its website would have you believe , and it do not deserve its star rating.the dÃ©cor be hideous â€?the wall be paint a dark blue/red/purple , and the furniture be shabby .<ssssss>instead of achieve the mod feeling that they be so obviously try to achieve , it just look ugly and dated .<ssssss>the crappy carpet square didnâ€™t fit correctly against the wall , and feel sticky underfoot .<ssssss>the shower be not clean and the water be lukewarm to cool .<ssssss>the toilet basin be not properly attach , and slam into the wall every time you flush .<ssssss>the air conditioning didnâ€™t work very well at all -lrb- keep we room at about 80 degree when on high -rrb- , and blow hot air directly at the head of the bed .<ssssss>additionally , the ac control be on the ceiling , so you have to pull up a chair to adjust they -lrb- not that it do you any good -rrb- .<ssssss>the bed linen be nice , and the mattress be fairly comfortable .<ssssss>but , rather than pay for a duvet cover for the comforter , they simply wrap it up in two sheet .<ssssss>the sheet , of course , didnâ€™t stay on the comforter well at all during the night .<ssssss>the end result be that you be sleep with 3 bunch sheet and one dirty comforter â€?not at all pleasant.the clarendon hotel be , quite obviously , a gay hotel .<ssssss>not a gay-friendly hotel , which we would have welcome .<ssssss>instead , we be make to feel very uncomfortable as the only heterosexual couple in the hotel .<ssssss>it do not help that i be 5 month pregnant , and have to endure god , i hate breeder !<ssssss>and like comment in the elevator and lobby .<ssssss>the clientele be obviously on the prowl for a one-night stand.the neighborhood be sketchy .<ssssss>there be two door from the parking area that ought to be lock at all time , but be always open and unlock during we 5 day stay here , leave the hotel totally unsecure .<ssssss>when we check out at 4:00 am , there be 5 different man wander the hall .<ssssss>one of they even follow we out to we car .<ssssss>be they guest ?<ssssss>people off the street ?<ssssss>who know ?<ssssss>it be very , very creepy.when we get to the front desk to check out , no one be there .<ssssss>we end up wait more than 25 minute for the front desk attendant to arrive , which make we late to the airport .<ssssss>so much for customer service.do yourself a favor , stay somewhere else .<ssssss>this hotel ruin my romantic vacation .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 4 5 4 2		much better than expect !<ssssss>i be worry , have never be to amsterdam and stay in a lowly rate hotel , but the review from the traveler be good .<ssssss>i always trust fellow traveler over travel critic .<ssssss>i be pleasantly surprise when we get there , we get there way before check-in and they hold we bag for we so that we do not have to walk around the city with they and offer we complimentary breakfast even though we be not check in yet .<ssssss>the staff be amazingly friendly , everyone be very nice and give we recommendation of place to go .<ssssss>the room be small with a tv , minifridge , and a private bathroom .<ssssss>they have the most amazing window , i love sit on the window sill just watch the city in motion .<ssssss>the free breakfast be great and in a cute little room .<ssssss>the best part be the location .<ssssss>it be within walk distance of most place .<ssssss>if you be look for a five-star hotel this be not it , but if you be look for a clean , safe , convenient , cheap hotel this be the pick!warning : if stair be a problem for you , do not stay here .<ssssss>depend on you floor you will easily be require to climb at least 100 step if not more .<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 5 5 2 5		my enthusiasm be wane i have stay at the covent garden many time in the past seven year , include four stay in 2007 alone .<ssssss>i have usually be very pleased , and have previously post a admiring review .<ssssss>this last time , however , the hotel let I down .<ssssss>the voicemail service be not work .<ssssss>i receive several call during my stay and the caller leave a message , which be completely indeciferable when i listen to the voicemail .<ssssss>the hotel first assure I that the problem be with the caller 's mobile phone , so i have nicky at the concierge desk call I and leave I a message -- and when he find that he could not do so , the hotel finally admit that it be a problem with its system .<ssssss>when they maintenance staff be unable to fix the problem , they move I to a different room .<ssssss>i ask the hotel to check they record to see if they could recover the number of the person who call I , but they be unable to do so , and i never do find out who have call .<ssssss>i expect better service in a world class hotel like this one .<ssssss>
3 2 2 3 3 4 4 -1		decent hotel , but need a lot of work i attend a wedding at the el san juan and read several dozen review from this site before i stay there .<ssssss>the review be so varied i have no idea what to expect .<ssssss>overall , i think the hotel be mediocre , especially for the amount of money they charge .<ssssss>the positive : the pool be beautiful , beach access be fabulous , the lobby and bar be very stylish and trendy -lrb- especially with a weekend crowd -rrb- , and the ballroom where the wedding be hold be a perfect space for celebrate .<ssssss>the negative : the room be design entirely in white which make every speck of dirt visible -lrb- and there be many -rrb- , the shower floor be filthy and mildewy , the mattress on the poolside lounge chair be leave out in the rain and be cover in visible mildew spot and dirt -lrb- for some inexplicable reason the hotel only provide white slipcover for some of the lounge chair so the stain on the other chair be visible for all the world to see -rrb- , we reservation for a garden view room turn out to be a room on the third floor with only a two foot window near the ceiling , and the wall of the hotel be paper thin so you can expect to be wake up several time a night -lrb- if you be lucky enough to be able to fall asleep -rrb- because of noise in the hallway or a neighboring room .<ssssss>to echo a lot of the comment in other post , even though it be the off season in puerto rico , we still have some difficulty find available pool chair .<ssssss>i do not really think this be the end of the world , but the fact that people can reserve a chair for the entire day -- even though they never use it -- just by leave a towel there be a bit ridiculous and it would be nice if the hotel have better control of that situation .<ssssss>i see no sign of bedbug , nor do i hear any of the other wedding guest voice complaint about bedbug , in spite of some of the other review .<ssssss>the island do have a lot of no-see-ums/sand mite and it would not surprise I if the reviewer who complain about bedbug have encounter some other insect out by the beach without realize it .<ssssss>
3 2 4 4 3 4 2 3		nice place , lot of inconsistency after read the current review , i be not sure i stay at the same place as these other people !<ssssss>we stay at the bavaro princess from may 17-24 , 2008 with the platinum upgrade .<ssssss>this be we 5th trip the punta cana , the past 4 trip stay at grand palladium bavaro .<ssssss>i be fairly well travel , have be a travel agent in the past.the only reason we decide to go somewhere other than gpb be to branch out and see what another hotel complex be like .<ssssss>we stay at gpb have be consistently amazing .<ssssss>i be just want to experience something different , but still have the wonderful bavaro beach and ocean !<ssssss>so , much of this review will compare between the 2 hotel , because that be what i know and can give my opinion on.first , this be a very large complex -- 92 acre be a lot of ground !<ssssss>however i would walk the large grounds at gpb , and i could get to the lobby from the beach in under 10 minute .<ssssss>here it be a good 25 minute walk .<ssssss>therefore you use the tram car to get back and forth .<ssssss>it be very bumpy and sometimes the driver be as crazy as the driver on the main road !<ssssss>get a seat can also be a challenge as people be ready to pounce on a empty seat , especially at the lobby stop .<ssssss>also after midnight these tram stop .<ssssss>we be able to get a cart ride from someone at the front entrance to the hotel , but i do not know if that be just because i show he my platinum bracelet .<ssssss>platinum upgrade here be most certainly worth it for the service , the room location , and the extra you get include .<ssssss>the amount you would pay for the cost of the massage , the motorized watersport , the dinner at licey and have room service once or twice-it cover the upgrade cost .<ssssss>you get premium alcohol upgrade as well .<ssssss>however that only help if they have the premium alcohol you want .<ssssss>i could not get bacardus rum there , altho if i drink scotch , i could get chivas regal .<ssssss>also altho only platinum member be suppose to be able to get the premium alcohol , i do see other order premium drink at the bar and they get it no question , even tho they do not have platinum wristband .<ssssss>the wristband be nice for platinum too-a string bracelet as oppose to the plastic amusement park type wristband everyone else get .<ssssss>all the other extra of be platinum be gravy above that .<ssssss>also i would say that if i do not have the platinum upgrade i would not reccomend this hotel at all.there be many inconsistency in the service and the food here .<ssssss>the time of year we travel be the start of the off season .<ssssss>i do not know if there be less staff or what , but i find the way we be treat to range from wonderful to indifferent .<ssssss>i also feel that i be in off season -- something i never experience at gpb .<ssssss>this feeling come from several different thing .<ssssss>certain alacarte we want to go to be shut down-one , which i have be look forward to as a romantic surprize for my boyfriend on he birthday dinner -- chopin-is suppose to have a boat come by with a piano player , and at time a singer .<ssssss>this float by you as you eat .<ssssss>well the night we go , we have reservation at 8 and be there till at least 1030 -- no boat , no piano-nothing .<ssssss>the boat be suppose to go by around 830 .<ssssss>we could not book mare nostrum as that be reserve for a private party the night we want it -lrb- understandable -rrb- , and the tanuki restaurant be just plain close .<ssssss>after read other review about these place , you want to experience they too , and then nope , you can not .<ssssss>we do eat at el gaucho -- tooooo noisy , busy and food just okay .<ssssss>beef all over hotel be generally tough .<ssssss>chopin-thought as a alacarte we would be serve , but this be buffet -lrb- apparently a off season thing -rrb- , mamma mia be wonderful , delicious food and server who bent over backwards .<ssssss>licey -- even if you do not have platinum , pay the $ 35 to eat here-it be well worth it .<ssssss>i wish we reservation have be for the begining of the week instead of we last night .<ssssss>i would have pay again and again to eat there !<ssssss>do not miss it !<ssssss>i be leary to go with the filet mignon after eat beef at the other restaurant -- but it be to die for -- cut it with a butter knife and it melt in you mouth !<ssssss>as to the buffet i enjoy a good breakfast-but after the 1st few day i rarely bother to make the trip , it be not worth it .<ssssss>from my experience , it seem if you get something cook to order at a buffet it be good , but pretty much anything else really do not have the right taste-i can not even tell you what the scramble egg on the buffet be make with because they certainly do not taste like any egg i have ever eat .<ssssss>the sausage be the same way .<ssssss>but a freshly make omelette be delicious .<ssssss>also , there be not many choice on the buffet .<ssssss>the gpb have about 5 time as many choice there as we find here .<ssssss>and believe I , i be not picky nor a connosieur or gourmet , i can not stress that enough so you will understand i be not be picky here .<ssssss>i just want something that taste good and be edible .<ssssss>also , even tho i be pretty careful about what i eat there so as to avoid any stomach upset , i still have 2 day with sour stomach and extra bathroom trip .<ssssss>unfortunately i also speak with a group of 6 other guest stay in the platinum area who eat at chopin the same evening we do and get very sick with vomit and diarrhea .<ssssss>apparently they all have the salmon , which we do not.room service be very good .<ssssss>we have breakfast and omelette and egg over easy be hot .<ssssss>however , it take 1 hour 30 minute and 2 phone call to get .<ssssss>people we meet say they have room service breakfast in 25 minute -lrb- the menu state 40 minute wait time . -rrb-<ssssss>also do not like that i have to call room service for ice in room -lrb- never come -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a set-up in the room to make cocktail , but no ice .<ssssss>i do not want to wait 40 minute to have a drink .<ssssss>gpb have ice machineshack every few building , and you serve yourself whenever you wish .<ssssss>all in all the food be a big dissapointment to I as i be never sure if something i be choose would make I ill or plain just not taste good and there would not be enough choice to get something else .<ssssss>believe I , i never have that problem at gpb .<ssssss>i think be the first vacation i ever lose weight .<ssssss>i will say a lot more staff here understand english , and there be also a lot more visitor here who speak english than at gpb .<ssssss>we meet a lot more people here , just strike up conversation as we go thru we day .<ssssss>the staff have a lot of inconsistency in how they react to guest .<ssssss>in the platinum lounge , we ask for a change of the rum from dark to light in we room , not a problem , they give we a full bottle of barcelo blanco for the room .<ssssss>another platinum guest ask to switch out the el presidente beer in he fridge with corona , and be treat rudely .<ssssss>we have wonderful experience at gpb-even have one waiter call we by name we 2nd year as we walk into the restaurant on we first evening .<ssssss>when you pass a worker at gpb - always a hola !<ssssss>and a smile .<ssssss>at the princess-very few be like that .<ssssss>it seem that for the most part these people be not happy to be there .<ssssss>in the buffet-not one server speak to we or make we feel welcome anymore than they have to in order to bring we what we need .<ssssss>we do see other have great waiter , who joke and laugh with they .<ssssss>we be easy go people who will get into conversation with just about anyone .<ssssss>and it be not that other have all great experience and we do not .<ssssss>we would experience this individually and also at time when people we meet there be with we .<ssssss>it be difficult to get a waitress to bring drink in the lobby .<ssssss>she would take use glass , get a order from all of we , and then never return .<ssssss>tip which we do often do not seem to make a difference.i do not like the lobby here .<ssssss>at gpb it be much more open and airy .<ssssss>also in the evening there be a band play slow dance music .<ssssss>it be very pleasant to sit there-you could speak with whomever you be with and not have to shout .<ssssss>there be very nice inside and outside space to enjoy a drink .<ssssss>at the princess - the show be right off the lobby .<ssssss>it be very loud and distracting .<ssssss>you be constantly say what do you say?oh one major thing i do not like -- as we sit on we balcony we be just enjoy the breeze midday and the maid be clean .<ssssss>we notice this day they be go to the pond by the platinum lounge and fill they cleaning bucket .<ssssss>okay well hmmm , i guess that okay to mop the floor -lrb- but still alittle icky -- you know pond scum and all -rrb- .<ssssss>we watch as the maid not only have first dip the mop and clean the floor , then she take a rag into the bucket , wring it out and clean glass for the room .<ssssss>oh my !<ssssss>needless to say we didnt use the glass in we room again !<ssssss>this do turn out to be a day when we find out a little later that for some reason the water be not work , only discover that because the toilet be not flushing -lrb- and of course on one of the day when i need extra bathroom trip ! -rrb-<ssssss>apparently this be all over the hotel , as we try to use the bathroom off the lobby with the same result .<ssssss>by late day tho we be able to get shower .<ssssss>yet no one seem very disturb by this or see cause to say anything to the guest about it that we could tell.i do have a nice vacation there , but that be all it be -- nice .<ssssss>not amazing.i try and make the best of whatever situation , but i be very disappoint here .<ssssss>after this long winded review , my opinion be that i love the platinum service part of this hotel , without it i would not ever stay there.but i do not think i would go back there though because of the food , it need to be greatly improve .<ssssss>if gpb have a platinum service available like that oh i would never leave there !<ssssss>
5 5 5 3 5 4 4 3		i think it be great and will be stay there again !<ssssss>i be read the last review on this hotel and i do not agree at all .<ssssss>that be why i be write this review .<ssssss>first of all , i be a experienced traveler and have stay in many different places.my friend and i stay here last december as a after christmas getaway .<ssssss>i book it on the marriott website since i be a marriott point member .<ssssss>i do not find the property tire at all .<ssssss>we room be gorgeous .<ssssss>maybe we get a newly remodel room but the lobby area be beautiful as well .<ssssss>be it in a great location to l.a beside want to be near lax ?<ssssss>no , of course not .<ssssss>it be a airport hotel .<ssssss>the pool be okay and the exercise room be actually pretty nice .<ssssss>please keep in mind this be a airport hotel .<ssssss>however , it be very close to santa monica and marina del rey where we go to dinner both night .<ssssss>i love it and will be go back again next month .<ssssss>i use to be a la resident for 4 year and would highly recommend this hotel but if you know nothing about l.a it be not near disneyland or universal studio .<ssssss>if you want to be close to disney , you need to stay in anaheim and if you want to be near universal you will have to stay in the valley some where .<ssssss>you be out closer to the beach area with this hotel .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 4 3 3 2		great location !<ssssss>we stay for 2 night with kid .<ssssss>we get a amazing 2-bedroom suite !<ssssss>-lrb- okay it be not cheap . -rrb-<ssssss>we have window overlook onto the very busy street and love the atmosphere .<ssssss>location be right in the center of the bustling , hustle center yet window well-insulated that you could not hear a thing once close .<ssssss>we walk from the train station -lrb- around 10-15 min -rrb- and feel very safe , unlike what another traveler say .<ssssss>the weekend staff be very nice , but come sunday eve and monday , there be some very unpleasant lady at the reception who growl .<ssssss>why they be there at such a nice hotel be beyond I .<ssssss>we ask they to recommend a good and reasonale restaurant and one of they tell we to go to natalino which turn out to be overprice and underportion so maybe she get a commission .<ssssss>anyway , hotel be in general great , staff so-so , location be amazing .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 2 2 4 5		apex - lovely location , a little impersonal though i have just return from a 2 night stay at this hotel and i have to say that for the price we pay -lrb- go through nectar we book via octopus travel 1000 point plus Â£155 -rrb- , it be very good value .<ssssss>however , i would not pay much more for a standard room.in the first instance i ring the hotel to check we booking , and i be glad i do as they do not actually know about it !<ssssss>i also ask whether we would be able to check in early as it be my partner 's birthday and i have book a show for 2.30 pm -lrb- normal check in be 2pm -rrb- .<ssssss>i be tell this should not be a problem and they would note it but to ring the hotel also on the day .<ssssss>i ring the hotel on the day only to be tell that i could not check in early as they do not have any of my type room available , but they be very quick to try and sell I a upgrade say that they have some of they deluxe room available .<ssssss>i say no as it be not in we budget and ask whether i could leave my luggage instead .<ssssss>i be tell that would be fine.i arrive at the hotel around midday and ask whether i could leave my luggage as we have a show to go to , and once again they try to upsell I a deluxe room -lrb- for a additional Â£20 -rrb- !!!!<ssssss>i feel that this be border on desperation , and consider that i have already say no , they should not have push it again , as to be honest , it make I feel a little embarrassed standing in reception .<ssssss>anyway , the hotel itself as other have already comment , be about a 2 minute walk from tower hill tube station - in a lovely area which be more lively during the week -lrb- due to the area mainly consist of office -rrb- , and quite quiet at weekend .<ssssss>most of the bar in teh area shut at weekend but there be a wetherspoon right near the hotel if you fancy a drink.our room -lrb- standard - no 613 -rrb- be very comfortable and in term of space be about average for a london 4 star standard room .<ssssss>the bathroom be bigger with a huge shower and a separate , but small-ish bath .<ssssss>there be also a speaker in the bathroom i suppose so that you can use the dvd/cd player , but ours be not work .<ssssss>they also clearly have not hoover the floor before we arrive as there be bit everywhere on the carpet !<ssssss>-lrb- yuk ! -rrb-<ssssss>breakfast seem to be serve in different area depend on the day of the week !<ssssss>at the weekend you could eat next to the reception area -lrb- but they allow smoking - which i find to be quite repulsive in such a modern hotel -rrb- , so the best area be in the restaurant section next to reception .<ssssss>we rate include they buffet breakfast consist of fruit , cereral , cheese , bread , pasty etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>which i have to say , be very good .<ssssss>if we have to pay for breakfast - i would not as i though for Â£13 or Â£16 -lrb- for cook -rrb- it be too expensive .<ssssss>there be also a a la carte breakfast menu should you desire it!one other thing that also upset we a little be becuase we have prepay prior to arrive , we be tell that on arrival we could either leave a credit card or settle any extra when we leave .<ssssss>however , on order a Â£1 .80 newspaper , we be leave a rather curt letter in we room say that we have to contact reception immediately with regard to we credit facility !<ssssss>we feel like criminal !!!!!<ssssss>on go down to reception we be tell it be because we have order a paper and have not leave a credit card !<ssssss>however this totally contradict what we have be tell when we arrive !!!!<ssssss>anyway , i leave my credit card detail at reception to avoid look like a thief ... after all , i do not want to be see to * steal * a Â£1 .80 newspaper !!!!!<ssssss>another embarrassing moment !<ssssss>i wonder if business people get treat the same way?so to sum up : the good bit : * spacious bathroom * great rubber duck to take home !<ssssss>* nice toiletries -lrb- although they be not replenish on the 2nd night after i have bag they !!!! -rrb-<ssssss>* nice breakfast * aircondition be effective * huge comfortable bed with goregous bed linen * the location -lrb- opposite a small park area -rrb- * free bottled water in the fridge * good stash of drink in room ; hot chocolate , coffee , tea * large tv and dvd/cd player * close to tubethe bad bit : * the reception staff be not the warmest people i have meet * i do not like be sell a upgrade room twice !<ssssss>* the carpet need hoover before we arrive !<ssssss>although room be very clean apart from this !<ssssss>* be make to feel like a thief/pauper by receptionwould i stay again ?<ssssss>yes , but only for the location and room facility .<ssssss>i would probably recommend this hotel more to business people as i have no doubt that they would be treat much better than we be by the reception staff .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 3 2 2 4		biggest disappointment in vacation we have just enjoy most of a 16-day vacation in spain .<ssssss>we visit many city and stay in several hotel .<ssssss>we last three night be spend at the hotel barcelona catedral .<ssssss>we check in at about 4:00 p.m. we be give a smoking handicap room that be very warm .<ssssss>the desk claim not to know about we request for non-smoking , yet the email be still on my computer with they response .<ssssss>we insert we spare keycard to activate the electricity and air conditioning and go out to enjoy the city until about 11:30 p.m. upon return to we room , the temperature be still very warm .<ssssss>the thermostat click off about 25 degree -lrb- about 80 f -rrb- needless to say the down comforter be way too warm and the maintenance people have long be go for the evening .<ssssss>we toss and turn miserably all night long .<ssssss>while we be shower , housekeeping knock on the door and then say she have the wrong room and procede to do the same to two more room at 8:00 a.m. i complain about the heat and request a plain bedsheet because the comforter be too warm .<ssssss>i also ask that we be compensate in some way for the bad night .<ssssss>we be tell they would need to talk to the manager about compensation .<ssssss>we be also tell we must not have insert the keycard properly to turn on the air -- not true , as we light work fine .<ssssss>we go off to explore the city again , not know what to expect for the night .<ssssss>we come back to the room nice and cool and a empty duvet cover -- no blanket and no sheet , and we toiletries on the bathroom floor .<ssssss>we have to ask for the comforter back .<ssssss>sleep be better that night .<ssssss>on we third and last night , the elevator next to we room growl all night long .<ssssss>it be another bad night .<ssssss>when we go to check out , they bill we for the water bottle leave in we room on the second night , and when we ask about compensation for we bad experience , they say they could offer we free breakfast .<ssssss>it would have be nice to know that before check-out .<ssssss>we be on we way to the airport , and have no time to enjoy even that meager offer .<ssssss>i would recommend avoid this hotel .<ssssss>we pay full rack rate and have one decent night sleep out of three .<ssssss>the location be fine and it be a new , but rather cheaply-constructed building .<ssssss>the bathroom appear to be formica-tile rather than marble and ceramic as in all other hotel we visit .<ssssss>i predict the building will not age well and the customer service will come back to haunt they .<ssssss>

3 3 2 -1 5 -1 4 -1		fun escape from home i really like a lot of aspect of this hotel , i want to give it a higher recommendation but i can not .<ssssss>i absolutely hate the bed , never have sleep in a less comfortable bed in a hotel/motel .<ssssss>i do ask to see if we be in one of the remodel room and the person at the front desk say the remodeling be complete so i guess these be the new bed .<ssssss>they be very soft and you fall off and wake up with back pain.it 's really too bad because we think the whole staff be exceptionally friendly and pleasant .<ssssss>from we waiter at the buffet in the morning to we shuttle driver , everyone be so accomodating .<ssssss>enjoy the breakfast quite a bit .<ssssss>the free shuttle be handy as well.pool and hot tub be decent and enjoyable .<ssssss>think that the internet access be pretty good .<ssssss>free wi-fus , $ 10.00 for 24hours web tv or a business pc located downstairs that you could rent.there be not a mini-bar or minifridge but there be a very clever little store locate in the lobby .<ssssss>they sell toiletries and drink and snack , all sort of thing , better price than most minibar and a much better selection .<ssssss>the best part be it be open 24 hour a day , which be nice because there be not any real store that be close.pay-per-view movie selection seem better than most and not too expensive .<ssssss>i definitely have a fun time , i just do not sleep well .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 3 3 4 -1		love it !<ssssss>we book the vacation with allinclusive.com and linda we travel agent there be wonderful !<ssssss>i highly reccommend use she for all travel arrangement .<ssssss>we go via applevacation .<ssssss>linda do all of the communication and we just receive the ticket , transfer , and hotel voucher and went.stayed 3/18 - 3/23 and unfortunately the wind have whip the wave to height of 15-20 ft. so we could not enjoy the beautiful beach for two of the day .<ssssss>the wave also make the visibility so poor we could not scuba dive , which be the main thing we want to do .<ssssss>oh well , we can not blame the weather on anybody .<ssssss>we book all of we excursion through glady at barcelo guest service .<ssssss>she be delightful , honest , and very easy to deal with .<ssssss>we room be 3302 and be very nice .<ssssss>it be in the renovate section over look the new pool and beach .<ssssss>we tip the maid every day and i do not know if it really make a difference .<ssssss>the hotel run out of lotion and other minor thing .<ssssss>the towel service be do by a seperate group of house-keeper , but we always receive clean towel , it be just at odd time everyday .<ssssss>the hotel staff over all be very nice and professional .<ssssss>the barcelo be huge and not all guest be easy to please .<ssssss>they do a great job deal with some very demand , and rude people.the language barrier be a issue at time .<ssssss>mainly at the bar , and restaurant .<ssssss>the bartender be not the best in the world , but usually very nice and at least one person behind the bar speak english .<ssssss>however , we be visitor to they country and they should not have to learn english to make my life easier .<ssssss>if you speak any spanish you trip will be much easier and without misunderstandings.the buffet be we biggest disappointment .<ssssss>it be large , busy , and without a whole lot of variety .<ssssss>after you second meal there you ready to do anything to eat at the a la carte restaurant .<ssssss>we eat at toiko , roma and el sombero .<ssssss>at toiko we have the odd experience of we chef walk off the job while the food be still cooking on the grill.at roma a very rude person bully the hostess into seat they two hour before they seating time , and before the rest of we wait for we schedule seating.el sombero be the best .<ssssss>great service , and great food.the beach be absolutely beautiful !<ssssss>you could walk for mile and never be able to take it all in .<ssssss>be prepare to see alot of trash wash up onto part of the beach.the pool be too cold to swim in , but very nice.the worst part be to see so many guest leave they water bottle , cup , and cigg butt all over the beach , and even all over inside the hotel .<ssssss>we will most likely be go back when we know the weather will allow we to dive .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 5 5 5		fantastic location and staff lovely lobby and pool , at first we be disappoint by the room and linen , -lrb- we be use to a higher thread count -rrb- but the staff and location make up for it .<ssssss>-lrb- we be hardly in we room anyway -rrb- nice little breakfast of fruit and roll every morning and a lovely little cocktail party .<ssssss>if you hate traffic you may want to ask for a off the road room .<ssssss>we play hard so sleep well even with a road side room .<ssssss>pay-parking be limit at the hotel , we do have a rental car and although pay parking be available nearby it be pricey and we be able to find free spot 4-5 block away .<ssssss>we would rebook.the van dam<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 3 4 3		love this place the st. loui hotel be one of my favorite place in new orlean to stay .<ssssss>located in the french quarter , less than one block from bourbon street it be the perfect retreat from a night on the town .<ssssss>it be courtyard be open all the time to relax by the fountain of just take a break .<ssssss>unfortunately the restaurant only serve breakfast this time of year , so you must find another place to eat dinner .<ssssss>if you want another option for breakfast the cafe du monde be just 6 block away .<ssssss>the window open up without window screen , not good if you have child , but beautiful if you want to feel the breeze blow at night .<ssssss>all the room be tastefully decorate in gold tone with dark wood furnishings .<ssssss>overall , this hotel be wonderful and i would go again .<ssssss>
4 2 3 5 4 3 3 4		second stay also a success my wife and i stay in this hotel over the thanksgiving weekend .<ssssss>we do so last year at the same time of year .<ssssss>both time we enjoy we stay here .<ssssss>breakfast be include and it be plentiful and delicious .<ssssss>a happy hour be hold from 5:30 pm to 7 pm -lrb- no alcohol -rrb- but that be wonderful as well .<ssssss>situate close to time square and broadway .<ssssss>subway very close by .<ssssss>bryant park be 1 block away and have many temporary shop and ice skating .<ssssss>staff be pleasant enough , but we do have several request go unanswered .<ssssss>we ask for a new change of linen each night contrary to hotel policy of only tuesday and friday .<ssssss>3x this be request and never honor .<ssssss>the tv have a faulty connection to the cable outlet and i have to play tv repairman more than once .<ssssss>the corner light stand do not operate at all .<ssssss>the bathroom be extremely small -- room for one person only and just get the door close you have to pay attention or else .<ssssss>we stay in 3104 which give we a nice view of the empire state building .<ssssss>however last year we stay in 2206 and it be much much bigger .<ssssss>room end in 06 and 08 be much bigger and those face the empire state building be the one you want to request .<ssssss>with city and state tax we pay $ 352/night for this hotel , so the value receive be borderline in my opinion .<ssssss>for that much money i want a fresh change of linen and towel .<ssssss>we be very conservative and do not waste , so for one week out of the year we like to indulge with fresh linen .<ssssss>all thing consider we enjoy we stay as repeat visitor .<ssssss>next year though i will be price shopping more than i do this year .<ssssss>
3 2 4 4 4 5 1 3		nice place , but horrible service the grounds and the room be in very good condition .<ssssss>a freindly staff greet we upon arrival , and checkin go very smooth.our only real complaint be the overall service .<ssssss>we really expect to get great service and be pampered .<ssssss>that be not what we get .<ssssss>absolute minimum time to get anything be 30 minute .<ssssss>when we get there , we go out by the pool and order 2 bottled local beer .<ssssss>they be $ 8 each , and it take 30 minute to get they .<ssssss>we be 25 foot from the bar , so needless to say the next round we go directly to the bar .<ssssss>then we try to order a sandwich from the bar , 45 minute later we cold sandwich arrived.the next morning at breakfast the trend condinue .<ssssss>i go and eat down the street where the price be reasonable , but my mother opt to eat a $ 25 fruit plate .<ssssss>it take 45 minute , and we have to ask twice where it be , just for a fruit plate.the beach in front of the hotel be in good condition , and they provide chair , umbrella , and towel for you to use free of charge .<ssssss>the pool area be also very nice , again towel and lounge chair be available.the hotel be very close to the airport , so be prepare to listen to they all day long take off .<ssssss>didnt seem to be a issue at night , luckily we could not hear they in we rooms.room be in good condition , marble bathroom , and a very comfortable bed.we eat most of we meal off site , because of price and poor service .<ssssss>
1 1 3 5 2 1 -1 4		my nightmare at the eurostar in my opinion this hotel be the worst hotel i have ever stay in .<ssssss>the hotel itself be ok but the carpet in the walkway be filthy , the reception be draughty and unwelcoming , the staff be rude and arrogant .<ssssss>we order room service with english tea with milk and grilled slamon , the tea arrive with no milk and the salmon be raw and cold .<ssssss>-lrb- i be tell this be normal in spain -rrb- on the second day i realise that i have a pot of estee lauder foundation miss from my dress table , i report this and nothing be do , it take a further 2 email and two phone call before i have a reply to say that i should have keep all item in the safe .<ssssss>i be shock as the safe be only small , would you expect to keep coat and makeup in the safe .<ssssss>this have never happen to I before. , all they offer be a free upgrade to a better room next time we stay but they would have to pay I to get I to stay there again .<ssssss>i be not the complain type but this really shocked I .<ssssss>

-rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i find many people to be really â€œclosedâ€?â€?lots of nationality and therefore lot of language barrier so iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s the reason but itâ€™s too bad .<ssssss>we be look forward to meeting lot of people from lot of place but it didnâ€™t happen .<ssssss>we do still meet lot of great people â€?but we meet almost all of they at the air transat meet and greet on we fist day â€?so they be all canuck and younger than we by 8 to 15 year .<ssssss>-lrb- thatâ€™s not to say that there be lot of people in the 20 to 28 age group â€?it just happen to be who we meet â€?this be not a young resort . -rrb-<ssssss>we still have lot of fun.for those of you that want a rating on the likelihood of strike up a romance here â€?it could happen -lrb- it could happen anywhere , afterall -rrb- but itâ€™s probably not a good bet .<ssssss>itâ€™s not really a singles scene â€?as i mention before , it be pretty couply.they also seem to let kid into the disco .<ssssss>maybe iâ€™m get really old but they seem way too young to be in there order alcoholic drink .<ssssss>although , i get ta admit that if i have be 15 year old or so , i would have love that the disco let I in !!!<ssssss>off site excursion : we go to steveâ€™s corner bar one afternoon but nobody be there -lrb- we forget that not everyone be on vacation like we !! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>it be a 15 minute walk from gp bavaro lobby and be in plaza bavaro .<ssssss>we do not make it to any other offsite party destination but mangu be next door at occidental if youâ€™re interested .<ssssss>we go on the reef explorer Â½ day trip .<ssssss>it be not super exciting or anything super fantastic but it be one of we best afternoon â€?so relaxing and just a nice experience .<ssssss>they take you out on a boat to a big float deck .<ssssss>the sting ray and shark be in big pen -lrb- i ask about whether it be humane and the air transat rep say she have look into it and say it rank well in international standard -rrb- .<ssssss>you snorkel around the pen with the ray and shark .<ssssss>then you can have a encounter with the ray where they swim all over you â€?literally .<ssssss>they also have little lady that do 15 minute massage .<ssssss>more snorkele around the deck area â€?there be some coral and some fish but not much .<ssssss>and they have float mat that you can just take out and hang on the water .<ssssss>fyi - no liquor and no smoking .<ssssss>again â€?not a super exciting afternoon but one that we do greatly enjoy .<ssssss>-lrb- there be another one that be a booze cruise of sort and you stop for a hour or so at the shark and ray and then get back on you catamaran and sail away .<ssssss>those people look like they have fun too . -rrb-<ssssss>try to parasail â€?mixed experience .<ssssss>despite my personal experience , i do think give it a try if the weather be nice !<ssssss>it do look fun - $ 35 per person and you go in pair .<ssssss>if the weather be not nice , buyer beware -lrb- we weather be not nice -rrb- .<ssssss>i think we be go to die on the water taxi ride out to the parasail boat â€?there be eight of we plus the water taxi driver and only two of we be at the front of the boat and the other 7 at the very back of the boat so the nose of the boat be practically point straight up !<ssssss>he be also zoom at the speed of sound and the water be rough â€?i fly up and off the bench seat a few time by about a foot and a half before i yell at he in a panic to slow down .<ssssss>when we get to the parasail boat , you have to transfer from the water taxi to the parasail boat â€?not so easy in choppy water .<ssssss>then , a bit later , the captain of the parasail boat take a wave sideways and i think we be go to capsize .<ssssss>there be a few more white knuckle moment on the parasail boat and then myself and my sister make the decision to abandon ship on the next water taxi that stop by â€?without even parasail !<ssssss>now weâ€™re not boater by any stretch of the imagination and about ten other people stay on the parasail boat with no injury or fatality to report upon they return , but it come down to we not feel safe so we do what be best for we .<ssssss>when we get back to shore , we immediately go for a strong drink !!<ssssss>two of we friend do stay on and do enjoy the parasail portion â€?but they be go for about 3 hour in total as the captain have to sail farther and farther out to the sea to avoid the brooding storm cloud !!<ssssss>-lrb- be that even safe ???<ssssss>be up in the air in a big float umbrella with a storm loom ?? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>by the time we friend actually do they parasailing , i donâ€™t think they could even see land â€?i would think that fly above the beach would have be the whole point of it .<ssssss>oh well â€?they enjoy it â€?oh i almost forget that there be lot of puke from seasickness -lrb- thank goodness my sister and i bail before that ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>ha ha!one bad thing â€ $ ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>one last thing â€?it didnâ€™t happen to we but we see it go down twice at checkout .<ssssss>they have in-room movie and nintendo game and i think maybe they system be faulty .<ssssss>two set of people say they be charge even though they didnâ€™t use it .<ssssss>one be handle by the air transat lady but the second one get out of hand .<ssssss>he be a huge big tall loud 60 year old canadian fellow and he be really piss off â€?it be only $ 22 but it be the principal behind it for he â€?he do not use the nintendo and therefore he be not go to pay for it .<ssssss>now , the canadian guy could have handle himself a little better too , but i be strike by the bad behavior of the guy that i think be the front desk manager -lrb- but iâ€™m not sure -rrb- .<ssssss>while i donâ€™t think any staff should ever have to take abuse from a client or customer -lrb- the canadian guy be swearing a bit but he didnâ€™t cross any major line -rrb- , i think a person in a front desk manager kind of role have to have a super-diplomatic way about he and this guy sooo do not .<ssssss>i also think a person in this type and level of role at a international resort should speak english -lrb- which he do not -rrb- â€?and german and italian etcâ€ ?<ssssss>because they be go to have to handle issue and problem that arise .<ssssss>he actually turn he back on the canadian guy and just walk away say that he be go to call the police and that the canadian guy couldnâ€™t get on the airport shuttle .<ssssss>i be sure that palladium resort will get a earful from the canadian guy and i may also send a comment myself .<ssssss>sooooooo , point behind this long story be to watch out for yourselve and maybe even ask when you check in if they can deactivate the nintendo and the movie -lrb- ?? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>and if something like this happen to you , maybe this be a better way to handle thing : do argue you side a bit , pay the bill if they will not back down , take down name of the staff involve and they position , take a copy of you bill , maybe even get the name of witness that see how you be treat , and then complain to the parent company when you get home .<ssssss>as much as i donâ€™t agree with how the front desk guy treat the guest , in he defense i can offer that i be sure he be truly just try to do he job and try to follow how he have interpret the policy and procedure that have be hand down to he by he boss from he boss from he boss .<ssssss>go to the parent company would be a better way to do thing and then let they handle they staff.anyhoo â€?youâ€™ll have a great time !!!!!!!<ssssss>wear sunscreen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<ssssss>

1 3 1 5 1 2 4 -1		overrate , dirty , tired and a little bit pathetic .<ssssss>overall , the experience in the hotel be just negative - the save grace be the location , charm and staff .<ssssss>i will start at the beginning : i book my room through the hotel website , and specify the need for a roll away bed and the number in we party .<ssssss>this be two week before arrival , and i prepay the room to ensure a value rate .<ssssss>upon arrival , i be inform that even though the note on my reservation state i have a party of 4 and need 2 roll aways , the reservation be only for one person .<ssssss>the staff admit that they have read the note , and be confuse by they - but no one bother to call I to clarify .<ssssss>they just wait til i show up , and then inform I i have to deal with a extra 60 dollar a night charge for a five night stay !<ssssss>they agree to take this down to forty consider the confusion but it be still irritating .<ssssss>additionally , they only give we one roll away for the entire trip.in order to find we a suitable room large enough for my party of four , we spend one night in a king suite on the ground floor , which be interesting , but rather dirty .<ssssss>the staff then kindly transfer we to a much larger room on the ground floor for the next 4 night .<ssssss>the room be absolutely infested with gnat to the point where i be cover in bug bite and scab .<ssssss>the carpet be almost black with dirt - just disgust .<ssssss>i have to walk around with shoe on at all time .<ssssss>although a charming room , if clean , it be just in need of a deep cleaning .<ssssss>the bathroom be clean , however .<ssssss>the restaurant be close - they lose they lease - so there be no food on site - which be one of the reason i choose the location ... .<ssssss>the employee be attempt a breakfast of pastry , coffee and oj .<ssssss>it be not much at all .<ssssss>the cable keep cut out repeatedly .<ssssss>there be no concierge , and the restaurant recommend by the front desk for brunch one morning be dreadful - not only the worst dining experience of the trip , but one of the worst in the past 10 year !<ssssss>-lrb- it be deserving of another review -rrb- .<ssssss>the location be very good , and the staff be typically friendly and seem professional .<ssssss>if you want this location , though , i would aim for the ramada directly across the street - look neat and clean .<ssssss>this place be just run down and in need of a deep cleaning .<ssssss>
5 3 5 3 5 5 5 3		completely relax experience i stay at the mandarin for two night , and have never receive such great customer service in my life .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and professional , the room be amazing , and the food at cafe sambal and azul be phenomenal .<ssssss>and the martini bar have over 250 type of martini !<ssssss>the only downside to stay at this hotel - for I - be the beach .<ssssss>while lay on the man-made beach be nice , there be not any access to the ocean ... which be a big negative for I .<ssssss>the pool nearby be very nice though , so at least there be some water .<ssssss>this be not the place to stay if you be look for a active nightlife -lrb- the hotel be about a 15 minute cab drive into south beach -rrb- , but it be a great way to pamper yourself !<ssssss>

4 3 4 5 5 1 4 4		unsatisfactory start but generally good i be just back today from a long weekend in this hotel , and although generally the experience be enjoyable , i be annoy about how i be treat check in.i have book superior room on the internet , and as we be give the room key i think i would double check it be superior.the receptionist tell I that it be not as they have overbook and there be none available.i be disapointed but be ok about it until i say i presume we would be charge for a standard not superior.she tell I i would have to pay the rate for the superior room.at this stage i say i have a book slip with a superior room on it and i should not have to pay superior price for a standard room that they have overbooked.she grab the room card off I , and then give I a superior room without even say anything .<ssssss>i be annoy as i really feel she feel she could be rude as we look young and be casually dress .<ssssss>i also query whether the room give be a superior as it do not seem like one-room 402 if anyone know could they post it on this page.i would like to highlight that we stay be really enjoyable , room be spotless , hotel be central and the rest of the staff be really helpful and friendly .<ssssss>
2 2 1 2 2 3 2 4		never again ocean blue how disappointing !!<ssssss>as a seasoned traveler , include europe and hawaii , i tell my husband that i would love to go to the caribbean and off we go .<ssssss>we travel with 5 other couple and they teenage child .<ssssss>the lobby and check in be lovely ... in fact the best air conditioning in the entire resort , include restaurant , be in the check in room .<ssssss>we go to we room which be mediocre ... the jacuzzi tub have sand in it , it smell like mildew and the view include a large wall and guard booth .<ssssss>we call the front desk to ask if we could get we own luggage after wait almost a hour for it to arrive .<ssssss>if you tip the staff the experience improve but not to we standard .<ssssss>we tip the maid daily and receive new towel everyday as a bonus unlike some of we friends.the beach be teal and pristine with soft , smooth sand .<ssssss>although the pool be spacious it be miss many bottom tile and it be crowd with people drink at the pool bar spilling drink within the water .<ssssss>somehow the water stay blue though .<ssssss>we avoid the pool and choose the beach where i even have a massage ... which be great !!!<ssssss>in fact the metamorphosis spa be nicer than we room ... i should have stay there!now for the food ... strange offering ... meat with grissel , goat , etc. hamburger ?<ssssss>not like the usa !<ssssss>although we be usually adventurous in we eating , we become vegetarian for the duration .<ssssss>the pizza at the beach buffet be we staple or mango which do not touch water while be clean .<ssssss>no one tell we until we be be transport that you cant drink or brush you tooth with the water !!!<ssssss>although i feel we be careful , by the 3rd day my husband be sick with intestinal cramp and unable to eat or drink , on the 5th day i join he .<ssssss>many of we friend in the group also become ill .<ssssss>by the last day i do not eat and only drink the bottled pepsi with the seal cap .<ssssss>i would never go back to this resort .<ssssss>the tip get tedious , they do not accept visa for purchase , no room charge either , and a atm that be not work would have give peso only .<ssssss>the conversion rate be suppose to be 29pesos - $ 1 , but my husband be overcharge at the golf course 35 - $ 1 and the gift shop tell I it be 34 - $ 1 .<ssssss>the golf course be a mess - dry up and they should be ashamed to call it a golf resort .<ssssss>la cana golf course be nearby and much nicer .<ssssss>i take spanish in high school thank god so at least i could communicate .<ssssss>all of the entertainment be in spanish include song at the bar .<ssssss>punta cana be a beautiful place but i would choose a different resort !<ssssss>bottom line pass on this one !<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 1 2 3 -1		what a dive we go to the chifley to celebrate we wedding aniversary .<ssssss>it be actually quite funny to find that the hotel we have be tell over the phone be brand new be as dirty as its car park .<ssssss>the floor be filthy the entire time we be there , the cupboard in we room be old and suffer water damage .<ssssss>the bar fridge be dirty , disgustingly dirty .<ssssss>some thing have obviously drip down and die in all its brown glory some time ago into the fridge door and all over the wine that we decide against get .<ssssss>the bed be simply white sheet over a uncovered doona , nothing like the picture on the web .<ssssss>the bathroom have mould inground .<ssssss>the shower be only big enough for one of we to get under the head at a time , and it face up .<ssssss>so we have to take turn in hold it for each other to avoid drenching the ceiling and so we could get reasonable wet without become very cold - lucky we like each other .<ssssss>bemusingly for we , the ` marble ' like sink be crooked and obviously unfinished -lrb- you could see the inside of the wall behind it , the mirror be delaminate and the sink tap flood the floor everytime we turn it on .<ssssss>the airconditioning be too loud to sleep with on - luckily we be have a big night out .<ssssss>but it wasnt all bad , breakfast be ok , even if they do take a few attempt to get the food we request .<ssssss>best way to describe the chifley be to imagine a grand idea where you totally run out of money so you have to get in someone to do up the apartment with a $ 100 dollar budget .<ssssss>it literally look like they run out of money for everything include cleaners.oh a final word , dont eat the complimentary apple - i feed mine to a pig.and please , please dont send you stock standard .<ssssss>management reply to I .<ssssss>

1 1 4 5 4 3 3 3		disappointing the breakfast serve when i be there be definitely not what one would expect of a 5 star hotel , and certainly not a established name such as the raffle .<ssssss>waitress serve I be from mainland china and do not speak english -lrb- unacceptable when there be so many local singaporean and filipino resident available in singapore who have be bring up speak english -rrb- .<ssssss>only reason i can see for hire mainlander be to take advantage of lower salaries.english breakfast at a colonial-era hotel , but no brown sauce !<ssssss>i now live in singapore , and all the ingredient need to create a proper breakfast be available at any local supermarket .<ssssss>again the hotel be cut costs.long bar - atmosphere spoil by pop/hip hop music.bar billiard room - wait 15 minute without be serve , have to go to the bar myself to order a drink .<ssssss>obviously management be not on top of things.overall - this be a very elegant hotel .<ssssss>i have be back several time since for drink in the evening .<ssssss>unfortunately it be run by the singapore government -lrb- raffle group be own by a ministry of finance-controlled hold company -rrb- and while it would be a stretch of the imagination to compare it to the state-run hotel in communist country , it would certainly do far better in the hand of a experienced hotel management group .<ssssss>raffle group could certainly learn from the dharmawangsa in jakarta and other stylish hotel in the region.there be plenty of other better run hotel in singapore , unfortunately they do not have the luxury of occupy a historic site such as the raffle .<ssssss>one do not stay at somewhere like the raffle if price be a issue , however i can not help state that the standard of service fall far short of what be expect of a se asian 5 star hotel.if you really want to stay at the raffle then do so , but do not get you expectation up with regard to service .<ssssss>this place be run to generate cash flow and they do not really care if you return as they have plenty of business anyway from the large flow of visitor to singapore .<ssssss>

3 2 3 -1 4 -1 4 -1		top rate condo in waikiki be overrate i do not know about the 1-bedroom , but the 2-bedroom be definitely a rip-off in this place .<ssssss>we be seasoned vacationer with a 4 and 5-yr old .<ssssss>we strive to get a good value whether we be stay a in 3-star or 4-star property .<ssssss>we read the glowing review of this place and get a entertainment rate for 50 % off the rack rate of a premium ocean view 2-bedroom unit .<ssssss>-lrb- the rack rate at the time of this review be $ 776 !<ssssss>- not much inventory in waikiki with 2 bedroom -rrb- so we decide to splurge this year.we be familiar with many waikikus property and realize most be build in the 70 's so many have room that still have that 70 's dated feel .<ssssss>the beach tower be no exception although there be renovation beginning in the lower floor unit when we check in .<ssssss>right away we be extremely surprise with the almost motel-6 like check-in area .<ssssss>tiny and a bit of a dingy/worn feeling .<ssssss>but it be just the check-in area , big deal i think , but surprising .<ssssss>we have a corner unit on the 32nd floor -lrb- i think that be in the top 3 floor -rrb- .<ssssss>unit be definitely 70 's .<ssssss>worn carpet , dark ugly wood , date kitchen , etc. gorgeous view of the ocean and waikiki -lrb- and the side of the building for the middle two unit that stick out farther . -rrb-<ssssss>at $ 388 a night , this be unacceptable so they move we to a center unit which have a better 180 degree view and the master be on the view side instead of the kitchen be on the view side of the unit .<ssssss>problem be , you really have to sit out on the lanai to really enjoy it -lrb- the overhang of the lanai above you be very low -rrb- , or better yet hang over the railing to get the full 180 degree from diamond head all the way around .<ssssss>all the corner unit do not appear to have large window around the corner on the other side of the building so you view from the living room be pretty narrowly focused.i initially decide to ` surrender ' and spend the next 6 day pay out the nose for a mediocre 2-bedroom condo but then i take the kid down to the pool and see the worst pool area i have see in a long time .<ssssss>the pool area be tiny and not enough seat area .<ssssss>my wife and i would have have a hard time find a place to sit to watch we kid swim .<ssssss>the sunning area be a separate area down the stair .<ssssss>it be large with plenty of room but you can not sit they and keep and eye on you kid at the pool .<ssssss>the pool area be very plain/ugly - nothing special at all .<ssssss>there be also a very close in claustrophobic feel to the pool area because of the side of the building so close by .<ssssss>unacceptable .<ssssss>-lrb- no tennis court to boot . -rrb-<ssssss>so we abandon the place and move to the dumpier waikiki banyan two block down and 1 block in for $ 130/night for a 1 bedroom with a partial ocean view on the 36th floor and a much better pool area with tennis court , put green , playground , two hot tub , and barbecue area .<ssssss>we stay there last year so we know what we would be get for we money .<ssssss>at 1/3 the price of the 2-bedroom at the beach tower , it be a much better value - definitely a step down from the beach tower though -lrb- except for the pool area -rrb- .<ssssss>i realize you pay for the view and location of the beach tower and it be waikiki , but lack of renovate room , and 2-star pool area do not justify the high price they be charge .<ssssss>i be not go to pay close to $ 400/night for a place that be not worth over $ 300/night - about $ 275/night max in my estimation consider the pool area .<ssssss>one thing i do notice when ride the elevator -lrb- which could take 5-10 minute to arrive , especially after 4:30 when they shut one down to let housekeeping do the turn down service . -rrb-<ssssss>be the majority of the guest be from japan where i believe they be use to pay higher price for thing .<ssssss>if you be more concern with location over value and want a spacious 1-bedroom or 2-bedroom condo in the heart with a unobstructed oceanfront view and do not care much about the pool and recreation facility , you will be happy with this place -lrb- as most other reviewer be -rrb- .<ssssss>if you have experience vacation a lot , stay at many different place in different level of luxury -lrb- especially with child -rrb- and be very value conscious -lrb- even if you can afford $ 500/night -rrb- you will be very disappointed with the value factor of the property -lrb- as you will with many waikikus property - but there be good value out there . -rrb-<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 3 3 1 3		a lesson in compromise i stay in the ritz carlton base on exceptionally low rate on the company 's website and glowing online review .<ssssss>although i be hardly a devotee of the ritz carlton brand , it be at the end of a six week trip through southeast asia -- and after stay at the legendary hotel in other city , i think perhaps i could forgo one top hotel on my trip and still be reasonably comfortable and contented with my choice .<ssssss>i be wrong .<ssssss>the ritz be teem with tourist group and family who have no doubt be lure -lrb- like I ! -rrb-<ssssss>by the rate and the rave about the property 's amenity and signature saltwater thalasso spa .<ssssss>although the grounds be lush with flora and beautifully landscaped garden , the din of the lobby and crowd pool area be not remotely resort-like or relaxing .<ssssss>it feel more like a convention take over by the spouse and offspring of the conventioneers.once show to my room , i be immediately take by the cheap quality of the material use to furnish it -- quintessential ritz style chintz and marble on a poor man 's budget .<ssssss>what be more , the wall be paper thin .<ssssss>i could hear the couple next door talk as if they be stand behind my headboard.the next morning , i be awaken at 7:30 am by loud chatter and laughter outside my window .<ssssss>when i draw the curtain back , i be astonish to see three employee garden five foot outside of my room , socialize as loudly as if it be the middle of the day !<ssssss>i go to the breakfast buffet -- which be jam pack with family and child -- and immediately feel queasy after drink the orange juice and tasting my cold scramble egg .<ssssss>my spirit be further sour by unsightly unbussed cup and saucer at the only free table i could find .<ssssss>i sustain a mild case of food poisoning from breakfast , and spend the early part of the afternoon rest in the room and wear earplug to drown out the noise of the gardener on one side of my room , and hotel guest pass by my door on the other.the poor customer service do not stop with dirty dish and rude gardener .<ssssss>on several occasion i ask the concierge to help I book a tour or deliver a newspaper to my room .<ssssss>in the hong kong peninsula or the raffle in singapore i would have receive cordial phone message and fax confirm my request .<ssssss>at the ritz carlton , they blow they off .<ssssss>i never receive a copy of the daily morning paper i see at other people 's door .<ssssss>finally , on my second evening , twist my body like a contortionist while training my camera on the setting sun , try to achieve the illusion of a tranquil sunset -lrb- hundred of people around I , i be not exaggerate , be mar the frame and take picture of that sun ! -rrb-<ssssss>, i have have it .<ssssss>i go up to my room and call the four season in sayan , ubud .<ssssss>i explain the noise/crowd issue to the manager , who be sympathetic to my plight and tell I he have hear the complaint many time before .<ssssss>he offer I a peaceful villa with a plunge pool and breakfast .<ssssss>i check out of that noisy , crowded , poor imitation of a five star luxury hotel and never look back .<ssssss>

5 5 5 5 4 3 5 3		bravo barcelo dominican beach my boyfriend and i and some friend decide to spend 5 day and 4 night in punta cana .<ssssss>we be attract to punta cana b/c of the all-inclusive , the beach , and most importantly , the price .<ssssss>after book the barcelo dominican beach , b/c we somewhat trust the barcelo name , i be a bit dismayed to read the poor review on tripadvisor.com .<ssssss>fortunately , we experience be totally the opposite .<ssssss>it be amazing for the price that we pay .<ssssss>the room ... we stay in the spa room in block 6 .<ssssss>luckily , we get a free upgrade b/c there be no more king size bedroom in the complex when we arrive .<ssssss>we room have a jacuzzi , day bed in addition to the king size bed , large bathroom , and a closet .<ssssss>the only downside about the room be that the first night we do not have strong hot water pressure , but that be rectify later on .<ssssss>moreover , we have to request extra towel , but i can understand that the resort be try to conserve water -lrb- re : save the environment -rrb- so it be not that bad .<ssssss>my suggestion , bring at least one towel with you for you bathroom , so you have a extra.the beach ... beautiful and very well-kept .<ssssss>it be not hard to find chair at around 11.30 / 12 noon .<ssssss>lot of sunny spot and shade spot as well .<ssssss>there be some seaweed in the water wash up to shore , but the resort can not control that .<ssssss>overall , the water be fairly calm and rather clean.the pool ... we have a swim up pool bar and three pool .<ssssss>i do not go into the pool , b/c i be a beach person , but the pool area from what i saw be well keep as well.the food ... the breakfast and lunch buffet be tasty .<ssssss>you best bet for breakfast be a omelette from the grill and for lunch , the grilled meat .<ssssss>i do not like the dinner buffet , however , we go a bit late -lrb- at about 9.30 pm -rrb- so perhaps that explain it .<ssssss>for dinner , you definitely need to book reservation for the restaurant on the property .<ssssss>we try wasabi -lrb- japanese -rrb- , bahia -lrb- brazilian -rrb- , and meson -lrb- spanish -rrb- .<ssssss>other guest tell I that the italian restaurant be very tasty as well .<ssssss>out of the one i visit , i like wasabi the best with meson a close second .<ssssss>wasabi be a hibachi style restaurant .<ssssss>the 24 hour snack bar be eh ... it just give you more incentive to eat on time.the drink ... free flowing and strong.the staff ... friendly and accommodate .<ssssss>i practice my spanish .<ssssss>many speak english , but do not go there expect the queen 's english , nor should you b/c you be in the dr.i also go to mangu one night and have lot of fun and we take a snorkele excursion .<ssssss>barcelo dominican beach be a pretty good hotel and worth the price .<ssssss>we walk down the beach to neighbor hotel and just from look at they on the beach , they do not look as nice as ours .<ssssss>overall , i definitely enjoy my vacation and it be quite relaxing .<ssssss>i be sad to go .<ssssss>
2 3 4 -1 5 -1 2 -1		great location but hotel have some issue we just get back from a five night stay over fourth of july weekend at the marriott waikiki .<ssssss>we stay in the recommend tower closest to the beach on the 24th floor with a great ocean view .<ssssss>the good -- the balcony view be fantastic ; the bed be big comfortable ; the location be perfect ; the laundry room be convenient by the pool with comfortable seating/television ; the lobby be nice with open air , waterfall , pond and a seattle 's coffee to get move in the morning .<ssssss>the bad -- the elevator be horrible -lrb- as state many time -rrb- .<ssssss>people would wait so long they pack in to any that open .<ssssss>the toilet flushing be somewhat loud .<ssssss>the air conditioner take a long time to cool the room .<ssssss>but the worst be the valet give we rental car away to another party on the day of departure .<ssssss>they do accomodate we by take we to the airport themselves , handle the return of the rental car the next day and pay all late fees/gas fillup and send a $ 50 gift card with apology , but it definately bother I the first whole day in kauai until we hear from they -lrb- do not call until the next morning even though the car come back around 7pm the evening before -rrb- that the car be return undamaged .<ssssss>i never have that happen before and i know the car would not leave the island , but be extremely concern that i would be responsible on the remote case that the new driver would damage the vehicle or hurt someone drive it .<ssssss>nothing happen , but i still wish they would have be more diligent in give car out no matter how similar they look .<ssssss>at $ 19/day plus tip , you think they could master match the hang ticket in rearview mirror to the number you hold relatively easily .<ssssss>i would have give the hotel 4 star even with the elevator because of the great visit , but the valet issue make I reluctant on revisit the hotel in the future .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		not a cookie-cutter chain hotel , but have charm we move to the st. pierre at the end of a educational tour -lrb- staying at another quarter hotel -rrb- because of cost savings , and have read tripadvisor review ahead .<ssssss>they be so mixed -lrb- some love it , some hate it -rrb- , that i be sure there would be funky charm there .<ssssss>the staff be very pleasant and helpful .<ssssss>the new owner -lrb- of ~ two year -rrb- be gradually perform long-neglected maintenance and repair .<ssssss>so , if you get the standard room , it may need work -- suite , etc. might have be beautify .<ssssss>the smaller pool area have a lovely large gardenia bush.we have a upstairs standard room with a rear brick wall , and while it be quite dark , it be extremely restful -lrb- a obviously new mattress -rrb- for afternoon siesta time .<ssssss>the only irritant be a ancient ac unit work very hard to put out minimal cooling .<ssssss>

3 2 4 4 5 1 3 3		nice hotel but do not stay here whilst wtc construction be still in process i search many a website to find the perfect hotel for we 5 night stay in new york and i eventually settle on the millenium hilton .<ssssss>the photo on the website look very nice and the value for money be good give we 5 night stay include new year eve .<ssssss>i have no doubt really that the hotel would be fine give the hilton name.the hotel itself be very nice , clean and with stylish decor and first impression be very good.ours problem however start at check in .<ssssss>i have pre-book a king room with a city view only to be tell there be none currently available , so we have 2 choice , wait for a room to become available later in the afternoon -lrb- it be 4pm when we try to check in -rrb- or take a lower room .<ssssss>we decide to wait for we room with a view that we wanted.we be pretty tired after the very long journey but sit patiently in the hotel bar for we room .<ssssss>after a hour we go back to the desk and be allocate we room on the 48th floor .<ssssss>the room be very nice with a view right over what be the wtc and the statue of liberty in the distance .<ssssss>i be perfectly aware that there be construction work go on prior to book the hotel but presume the work would stop in the evening and continue in the morning and as i be someone who sleep well i do not think it would pose a problem â€?how wrong could i be ?<ssssss>i decide to have a quick kip before head out for something to eat on the 1st evening , i lay on the bed for 2 hour between 5 and 7 and didnâ€™t sleep a wink due to the very loud construction noise .<ssssss>on we way out for something to eat we ask at reception what time the work would stop , we be tell maybe 11pm sometimes earlier sometimes later -lrb- not very helpful -rrb- we ask for some ear plug which they appear to have plenty of.the long and short of it be that the construction go on all night and we do not sleep a wink , even with the ear plug and a pillow on my head .<ssssss>we phone down to reception in the morning and ask to be move to a quieter room or alternatively to relocate we to another hotel and we have no intention of stay where we be and have 5 sleepless nights.we take we luggage down to reception and go out for the day .<ssssss>we be tell we would be allocate another room .<ssssss>we return to the hotel at 8pm to find we have not yet be allocate a room , after about Â½ a hour they find we a new room .<ssssss>it have twin bed and no city view but the room be quiet and we be too tired to argue the difference and the receptionist do not seem too bother anyway .<ssssss>i intend to take this further with hilton now we have return home.on the positive side as before the actual hotel be very nice .<ssssss>ideally located for down town manhattan with subway on the doorstep cost $ 2 for a single journey anywhere in manhattan .<ssssss>new york be a fantastic place , everything you think it will be and a place you have to visit at least once .<ssssss>the shopping be amazing and very cheap in comparison to the uk , there be many bargain to be have .<ssssss>the food be also fantastic , we eat in fish in greenwich village and have whole lobster for Â£15.new york at this time of year be very very busy , i would definitely return again although probably at a quieter time of year .<ssssss>if you go when its busy expect to queue for everything.with regard to the hotel i would definitely not stay here again until after the construction have finish and would not recommend to anyone to stay there at the moment .<ssssss>

5 5 5 4 5 2 5 2		do not hesitate to book it !<ssssss>we have just return on the 24th from a 14 night holiday at this resort and overall we love the experience.less positive point first : in relation to the journey from the airport to the resort - yes , it be bumpy and you might , like myself , feel a bit sick after a hour of what i would call ' a dominican drive experience ' .<ssssss>just take the opportunity to check the view and the way people leave.the check-in at the hotel - this be the only negative point i have to make about the hotel .<ssssss>the person at the reception be rather unhelpful .<ssssss>first tell we to wait without give any apparent reason for it and , after a good 20 ' , come to we , give we the card to the room and do not give we any other information -lrb- e.g. how to get to we room or other basic information -rrb- .<ssssss>later we go back to the reception area and we have speak to a very nice concierge who apologize and provide all the information we be after.now the positive : room - lovely room , with a lot of space and near the cascade pool , in very quiet location .<ssssss>all the drink in the fridge be nice and cold and the air conditioning always work well .<ssssss>very clean and great turn down service -lrb- some great surprise -rrb- !<ssssss>thank you to the lady that clean we room - 4211swimming pool - beautiful surroundings , endless pool and very clean beach - as i be not a swim pool person , this for I be one of my main concern , as some of the review be rather worrying .<ssssss>i want this holiday to be very special as it be we wedding anniversary and a long wait holiday too .<ssssss>because of the comment about the water it take I a while to decide to book this resort .<ssssss>i be so relieved to see a amazing , almost immaculate white sandy beach !!<ssssss>yes , there be always red flag -lrb- this mean you can enter the water up to waist level -rrb- and some area with black flag , but i believe this be merely to avoid any adventurous people to go too far from the coast and put themselves at risk .<ssssss>i do not consider the sea be rough .<ssssss>moreover , you can walk more then 100 meter into the water with the water below you waist .<ssssss>we have spend the majority of we afternoon enjoy the warm water or snorkeling .<ssssss>we see quite a lot of fish although not a wide variety but you can always book a trip to enjoy good snorkeling in other part of the island ... the scenario be really beautiful .<ssssss>love see 9 very well organize wedding happen at the beach without any disruption to the other guest -lrb- just make the scenario even more idyllic -rrb- we always have one of the bartender come around regularly .<ssssss>a special thanks to juan , altagracia and all the people that work at the beach under incredible hot sun and make sure we always have a drink in we hand !<ssssss>they well deserve a tip !<ssssss>food - you have 8 restaurant to choose from .<ssssss>overall they be all quite good except for the oregano .<ssssss>i order a vegetarian lasagna and honestly , this be the most hard lasagna i ever have in my life .<ssssss>i have never see anything like that and could not stop laugh at the situation .<ssssss>love the grill , specially the fillet mignon .<ssssss>spice be also one of my favorite as well as barcelona but my husband prefer chez isabelle .<ssssss>some of the food be a bit too salty to my particular taste and there be some food i do not try again , but this be due to my personal choice but generally it be very good.only one comment on the portion size and some holiday maker attitude .<ssssss>they be enormous and the majority of people do not eat even half of they meal .<ssssss>this be particularly noticeable with we american colleague who happily ask for several different food and then only have a few bite in each leave the rest in the plate .<ssssss>i be sorry guy but i find this a bit difficult to understand .<ssssss>this people earn a average of $ 350/month , leave in-hall and we be in a very poor country .<ssssss>i find it almost insulting this lack of consideration -lrb- i really need to share this thought -rrb- .<ssssss>also on tuesday they have the beach party with traditional dominican food .<ssssss>take lot of repellent and go , you will enjoy it!entertainment - day entertainment - we never get involve , but there be plenty of activity for you to joinnight entertainment - although not traditional , there be some really nice show .<ssssss>my favorite : michael jackson and the circus .<ssssss>the spa - please experience the serenity couple massage , well worth the money.finally , as we go on the saona trip we have the opportunity to see other resort as they have to collect some people on the way .<ssssss>you will regret if you do not go to excellence ...<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 2 5 5 2		nice location and service in a old style hotel the alessandra be a nice , old style hotel , with antique furniture and decoration .<ssssss>the hotel be located on the second floor of a very old building and , mind you , because of that there be no elevator all the way up - you still have to climb some step .<ssssss>staff be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be just great , with lot of different option available.the room themselves be big and the furniture be quite old and elaborate , if you be into that sort of decoration .<ssssss>i have a issue with cleanliness , since we bed sheet and bath towel be visibly stain .<ssssss>not like a fresh stain , more like those that you just can not get out no matter how much you wash .<ssssss>so , they be freshly clean , but stain .<ssssss>they should just throw they off .<ssssss>that and the huge hole in the bead spread be kind of off-putting .<ssssss>a internet point be available in the hotel 's lounge but wi-fi be price the same way , which make it outrageously expensive for 24 hour access .<ssssss>tv be very old and with lot of reception problems.the hotel be very nicely located , close to just about everything in florence .<ssssss>the street be just ok at night , safe enough but without many people around .<ssssss>
2 3 1 -1 1 -1 2 -1		a very average stay i have stay at this hostal twice ; once in 1997 with my mom , dad and sister and the last time this past july with my husband .<ssssss>let I explain that both experience be completely different .<ssssss>hotel toledano be really a hostal , so if you be use to stay at hostale or pensione in spain there will be no problem .<ssssss>el toledano provide a tv , bed , desk , airconditioning -lrb- a rarity , really , even if it spit out air at 85 f -rrb- , and a bathroom with hot water .<ssssss>the first time we stay , we be in a room overlook the rambla with a balcony .<ssssss>it be a great room .<ssssss>we have a great experience .<ssssss>this past summer we stay in the smallest double i have ever see in my life .<ssssss>there be a little tiny window face a wall , airconditon that , quite honestly , be necessary because the window would have offerend no ventilation .<ssssss>a bathroom that probably would break fire stafety standard even in spain .<ssssss>mold all over the bathroom .<ssssss>one foot of space around the bed to walk or put you suitcase , not both at the same time .<ssssss>a tv and a very dirty comfortor on the bed .<ssssss>since it be a hostal , and we pay only 45 euro a night , i accept these condition .<ssssss>when i complain to the staff after the first night - the sheet be not change , the comfortor roll up in a ball and place under the desk , the bathroom not clean properly , i be meet with indignation .<ssssss>it be a family run business , and of course the person at the desk will defend he family .<ssssss>understandable .<ssssss>i will not stay here again unless i can get room with the balcony overlook the rambla .<ssssss>for $ 20 more a night you can get a 3 star hotel on expedia.com .<ssssss>this hostal be just not worth it .<ssssss>

4 4 5 2 5 5 4 5		intrusive train noise , and that hamster feel the room here be beautiful , and the bathroom alone be half the size of many japanese apartment .<ssssss>add in the free internet service , free herald tribune under the door each morning , complementary coffee and tea , and the hotel deserve 4 star .<ssssss>now for the bad news .<ssssss>we room face the shimbashi train station , and the noise be persistent and loud between 5 a.m. and midnight .<ssssss>a noise generate air purifier be cleverly leave run to mask the noise , but do not help .<ssssss>most frustrating for we be the location of the hotel , attach to the complex of building know as the shiodome .<ssssss>this complex be reminiscent of one of those large hamster habitat , with a bewildering 5 level array of overhead and subterranean walkway .<ssssss>a plan stroll to the palace garden turn in to a 3 hour fitness program of stair climbing and many wrong turn .<ssssss>we seem to always be on the wrong level and the numerous orientation map place at corner each have north point in different direction .<ssssss>bono would love tokyo , because it be a place where the street have no name .<ssssss>you first challenge be to exit the building .<ssssss>you can not simply hop in the elevator and go out the front door .<ssssss>you must first descend to the lobby level on floor 25 and parade across the lobby to the elevator on the other side of the room .<ssssss>mercifully , this hotel do not employ a legion of service worker bow and chant pleasantry as you pass in front of they .<ssssss>once at the next bank of elevator , you must choose between the one on the left that take you to the overhead walkway and main entrance or the one to you right that also go to the subway level .<ssssss>even at the subway level you will be descend and climb stair in order to get through the bottleneck of the shimbashi station .<ssssss>whatever you do , do not try to leave the hotel from the main door entrance .<ssssss>the surface road be all but impassible to pedestrian .<ssssss>you will spend you day climb and descend long staircase .<ssssss>and heaven forbid you should try to enter the nearby dentsu building to use the escalator .<ssssss>you will cause a great deal of stress to the security guard whose job it be to keep people like you out of there .<ssssss>like caged rodent it will take you several day to learn the best pathway to food and entertainment from you room .<ssssss>perhaps some people thrive on this sort of complexity , but if you knee and brain be age you may prefer simpler surroundings.some advantage to the location include : fantastic miyazaki design mechanical clock on the pedestrian walkway level .<ssssss>play a enchanting tune several time per day .<ssssss>arrive several minute before the schedule performance time .<ssssss>some people have post the performance on youtube.commany low cost , high quality restaurant in the surround building .<ssssss>the shimbashi station be on the jr yamonote line .<ssssss>day pass for the jr yamonote line be only 730 yen .<ssssss>it circle tokyo and take you to most of the interesting neighborhood .<ssssss>

1 1 3 3 1 4 2 -1		terrible experience the hotel look nice when you show up , but disappoint on almost all count go forward .<ssssss>service be lousy ... example , ask for a towel in the late afternoon at the pool , and the attnedant hand we two towel from the use towel bin .<ssssss>try to get a towel at the beach , and the attendant look as if you be request some sort of miracle .<ssssss>food be mediocre .<ssssss>order some chip with guacomole and the chip come coated in oil , literally .<ssssss>would never come back .<ssssss>only good thing i can say be that the room be decent ... that be it .<ssssss>
3 4 3 2 3 5 4 3		a standard airport hotel .<ssssss>let 's face it , you would not choose this type of hotel for a vacation but you would if you want to catch a plane .<ssssss>not a particularly goodpart of town with view of parking lot , highway and plane landing.however , we find the room to be clean , staff friendly , rate goods and bennigan a good place to eat .<ssssss>staff be more than happy to let we chill out at the pool after check out before set off for the airport .<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 5 4 5 3		beautiful resort - not great for scuba though we have be to many resort throughout the caribbean and this one rank as have one of the nicest grounds we have ever see .<ssssss>i would say that they food be above average , and the nightly buffet be very good if you choose not to go to a restaurant .<ssssss>we do not find it difficult at all to get book for dinner and think the japanese and sea food restaurant be the best .<ssssss>be prepare for long walk at this resort as the grounds be huge .<ssssss>they have golf cart type train that roll through the resort at regular interval but we find it faster to walk .<ssssss>keep in mind that they be not on the ocean , they be just off the beach so you will need to walk to the ocean to get a view of it .<ssssss>they do have one of the nicest pool i have ever see and the staff be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>the real downside to this resort be all the timeshare hassle -lrb- everyday they will be hit you up -rrb- and we experience be that the scuba diving be terrible .<ssssss>the water you will dive in will be rough and the visibility will be about 40 foot .<ssssss>i would recommend pass on this resort if you be go on a dive vacation.if you do not mind just stay in the resort for you entire vacation and just relax and perhaps spend hour at the pool bar :-rrb- - this would be the resort for you .<ssssss>

the blaze sun beat down on you mercilessly from the cloudless sky drain most of one 's energy .<ssssss>the swimming pool be like a bath-tub of hot water , the ocean just slightly cooler .<ssssss>when you go back to you room the fan could not cool the room down sufficiently , and if you leave the balcony door open to try and catch a breeze -lrb- there be none -rrb- , with no screen you become fodder for the bug .<ssssss>when you go to eat at the restaurant , all the establishment be overheate due to the cooking do and the amount of people seat in the confine space .<ssssss>the worst be when we go to the japanese restaurant maiko , they take we to a small room seat 10 people around a grill where the chef would grill the food on the spot .<ssssss>great idea ?<ssssss>no , as you walk in you start perspire , by the time the chef put the meat on the grill you be drip all over the hot food you really do not feel like eat at all .<ssssss>we keep on ask question / demand answer , go back between the hotel management staff , gold club representative tour operator representative day in and out without ever get a straight answer about when we would get the a/c back on and what progress they be make .<ssssss>one of the customer rep even take we to a site to show we how the staff be work on the repair - only to see a bunch of poor , overheate dominican each hiding in they piece of shade try to grab a shut-eye .<ssssss>the management offer compensation , 3 day off we next visit .<ssssss>nice idea , if we be fool enough to ever come back again !<ssssss>i do not think so !<ssssss>the attitude be such that we be to expect it to be warm and just endure it , suck it up like the dominican do .<ssssss>however , we pay for a luxury , 5-star , all-inclusive resort with all the list amenity at we disposal - not to suck it up like the local do .<ssssss>we all know how valuable we vacation day be , so when we pay thousand of dollar to get what be promise to we then we expect to get what we pay for.general comment : room : nice , spacious , clean , and functional.hotel : the grounds be well groomed , this be a big , 1500 + room resort organize around 2-and 3-storied house , have a well organize train run 24/7 between the villa and the central reception/restaurant / entertainment area.beach : white sand , plenty of lounge chair , but best spot take early in the morning .<ssssss>there be a beach bar serve all sort of cocktail / drink during the day.pools : just off the beach be the largest pool with pool bar , shallow end and whirlpool area .<ssssss>the bar staff very nice , happy to please a mostly rowdy and loud crowd of people -lrb- canadian american mostly -rrb- who have by the end of the day all consume more than enough of alcohol .<ssssss>some of the guest seem to forget they manners and decency after the first drink , but the staff manage they nicely too .<ssssss>there be two other pool in the middle area of the resort , however one be drain of water and be fix during we stay , the other similar to the large one have a pool bar to swim to and be of decent size .<ssssss>restaurant : the food be often bland , but there be variety .<ssssss>fish and meat be generally overcooked and not too appealing .<ssssss>be careful with seafood , we all suffer during and after we stay from food poisoning .<ssssss>the japanese restaurant be a joke really , far from authentic .<ssssss>the french cafÃ© de paris be decent , nice wine-server .<ssssss>the mexican and seafood restaurant be passable .<ssssss>the 2 buffet restaurant be fine really ; in hindsight they have the best choice of stuff for anybodyâ€™s palette .<ssssss>entertainment : they try , but donâ€™t really succeed .<ssssss>more entertaining be actually the barmen / waiter who will on occasion just start dance to the latin beat with a guest and that be fun to watch -lrb- live proof that you have to be bear with rhythm -rrb- .<ssssss>there be scuba and wind-surfing lesson offer , but we didnâ€™t attempt they so can not comment .<ssssss>all in all â€?the management of a 5-star resort should be able to manage a a/c situation much better .<ssssss>it be tough work in the tourism industry , grant , but we all get cranky when someone / something usurp we vacation , and gran bahia have no grace under fire .<ssssss>the place be a bit boring , but not something that could be call a calm , restful vacation spot as the rowdy drunk and small child see to that .<ssssss>
2 3 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		the elevator be a nightmare do not stay at this hotel unless you want to wait at least 15 minute everytime you use the elevator .<ssssss>they tell you they be be renovate , but the new computerized system be not help .<ssssss>the lone elevator operator be the most popular employee in the place .<ssssss>people literally run to he elevator when the door open .<ssssss>when i complain to a manager , she tell I the average wait , before renovation start , be 30-45 minute , and that we be lucky we be only wait 20 .<ssssss>there be 13 elevator , two of which only serve the restaurant on the top floor , and two be be renovate , so 9 elevator be serve 5000 guest .<ssssss>not a pretty sight .<ssssss>time be much too precious on a trip to new york to waste it wait for elevator .<ssssss>i travel to new york once or twice a year , and i would like people to know this be not representative of most other hotel in new york .<ssssss>i be attend a conference , and the facility be excellent .<ssssss>we room be clean and beautiful .<ssssss>the food serve at the conference be wonderful .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful , except for the manager previously mention , but i would never recommend this hotel to anybody .<ssssss>
3 4 5 2 5 4 4 -1		great hotel , poor location we indend to stay at this hotel for 3 night but end up stay for just the one .<ssssss>this be not down to the hotel it be purely due to its poor location in relation to ocean drive and lincoln avenue where all the life be .<ssssss>we time we walk at 45min from the hotel along the boardwalk -lrb- which be lovely by the way -rrb- .<ssssss>we do not fancy walk that , there and back everyday .<ssssss>we get a taxi back and that cost we $ 10 -lrb- Â£5 -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel however be lovely , we get a great room overlook the beach , it be clean and spacious .<ssssss>the pool area be nice but be pack with german tourist and yes they reserve all the bed before breakfast.breakfast be ok , do not like the idea of all the food be just lay out with no cover on , the breakfast cereal be simply place in large jar and people have to lean over they to get cutlery etc.the valet parking be trouble free and the staff where all very helpful and speak perfect english as long as you speak clearly to them.the lift be still not work , there be some contractor work on the lift when we get there but still no joy .<ssssss>the remain lift however be fine and we certainly do not have to wait long for it .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great location , beautiful building but disappointing !<ssssss>we stay at the new york palace hotel for 5 night for a special celebration , have do a lot of research to ensure we trip be not spoil by a disappointing hotel .<ssssss>the location be great .<ssssss>the view from we room -lrb- overlook st. patrick 's cathedral -rrb- be breathtaking , both day and night , and exceed we expectation .<ssssss>the combination of historical mansion and skyscraper provide a luxurious and unusual hotel for new york and the interior be beautiful .<ssssss>the housekeeping be exceptional and the housekeeping staff be both professional and friendly .<ssssss>we be very happy to leave they a tip .<ssssss>however , the food in the istana restaurant -lrb- casual -rrb- be extraordinarily expensive for its ambiance , with breakfast item individually price -lrb- coffee at breakfast $ 7 ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the atmosphere be more like a airport wait lounge than a luxury hotel , with various business people come in from outside the hotel for breakfast meeting and people walk through carry coffee purchase from nearby franchise .<ssssss>each day , we be ask if we have make a reservation -lrb- for breakfast in a hotel we be stay at at significant expense ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>even on sunday afternoon , when we just go for a cup of coffee -lrb- there be no refreshment make facility or provision in the room -rrb- , we be surround by three group of businessman have business meeting and make note .<ssssss>consequently , we do not have dinner there .<ssssss>we try to book for the luxury restaurant but do not succeed as you could only ring at certain time , you could not call in to book , you could not make a same-day booking and we do not want to waste we precious time hang around .<ssssss>i have read comment before we visit of guest who have feel they be treat really specially .<ssssss>we be greet on the first day by one of the porter who go to great length to explain everything in the room and that he would be look after we for the whole of we stay .<ssssss>we tip he - but never see he again .<ssssss>the staff be always professional and competent , but we end up feeling resentful of have to tip all the time , just for people to do they job .<ssssss>although it be a large hotel , and i do not really expect anyone to remember we name , it would have mean a lot to we if someone have ask if we be enjoy we stay .<ssssss>that would have make we total stay there special , instead of we just stay in a special building .<ssssss>unlike the business and wealthy guest , we will not be able to afford to go again , so it be a shame it be disappointing .<ssssss>
3 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		get the job do , but there be better hotel my firm use the muse to house client , and i recently stay there .<ssssss>i be disappointed and will not recommend it to my client .<ssssss>in time square , i recommend the hotel qt on 45th st. for cheap/cool room or the w time square for expensive but impressive .<ssssss>for a similar price as the muse , the gansevoort in the meatpacking be a far better alternative for trendy/sleek accomodation .<ssssss>-lrb- all of these hotel be often sold-out , so plan ahead . -rrb-<ssssss>the muse get the job do , but it be basically a dressed-up holiday inn with a theatre theme .<ssssss>the target demographic appear to be age 45-65 tourist woman , as the hotel have a distinctly feminine feel and do not have the cutting-edge design of other nyc sleep .<ssssss>the small lobby be cramped , and the limited baggage staff mean bag be leave piled-up near the door .<ssssss>the location be on a grimy sidestreet , though this avoid the zoo-like scene at place like the hopelessly-touristy marriott marquis and westin time square , whose service represent the worst of new york attitude.the muse 's room be small -- do not trust the claim that they room be larger .<ssssss>a chinese menu be slip under the door , which make I wonder about security here .<ssssss>the bed be fabulous with excellent feather duvet .<ssssss>the window be small with limited view .<ssssss>furniture and carpet be a bit dinged-up and have suffer some wear tear give what i would expect for muse price .<ssssss>the bedstand be laminated wood , kinda cheap and generic .<ssssss>nothing innovative or with cutting-edge design .<ssssss>toilet paper be cheap , hard , and cardboard-like .<ssssss>bath amenity be typical gilchrist soame .<ssssss>housekeeping knock twice -lrb- at 9am and 10am -rrb- the morning we check out ... they be far too eager and -lrb- apparently -rrb- poorly train .<ssssss>put out the do not disturb sign .<ssssss>best part of stay here : the bellman who hail the taxi home be very friendly.overall , you be pay w , gansevoort , or ritz price for a fancy marriott or holiday inn .<ssssss>either pay half the muse 's rate and stay at hotel qt or get you money 's worth at one of nyc 's better-quality boutique .<ssssss>
4 5 5 3 5 3 4 5		very modern , art hotel very nice and clean hotel .<ssssss>we spend there 4 night and everything be excellent .<ssssss>the hotel be very modern , the room huge , paint in a nice light green colour .<ssssss>the bed very comfortable and pretty big and the bathroom stylish and clean .<ssssss>the people in the reception be polite give we detail for what to do during we stay .<ssssss>there be only 2 thing that be not so good .<ssssss>the coffee station be not availiable in room of the lowest category -lrb- fortunately we know and we have book a room of a higher class -rrb- and secondly the elevator be really slow , so i use many time the stair and as we be stay in the 5th floor it be sometimes tire .<ssssss>
3 3 4 2 4 4 4 2		nice hotel but ... .<ssssss>we find a 2 bedroom condo high atop the ala moana and spend a week there last month .<ssssss>since we stay in a condo this review will be on the hotel itself not the rooms.our main purpose in go to hawaii be fun on the beach in the ocean.if that be you purpose this be not the best hotel for you .<ssssss>the beach at ala moana park be quite a hike then there be very few wave .<ssssss>it be too calm for we .<ssssss>we end up take a cab down to waikiki when we be ready to swim each day.it be connect to the ala moana mall which make shopping eating very convenient .<ssssss>the staff at the hotel be very friendly .<ssssss>the elevator seem to move fairly quickly so there be never much of a wait for one .<ssssss>look like they have do a recent renovation there so the lobby hallway appear nice not wear at all.so bottom line if you be there for meeting at the convention center this hotel should do you just fine .<ssssss>if you be interested in fun in the sun or nightlife move on down to waikiki .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 4 4 5 -1		ok hotel , great service !!!<ssssss>the hotel be old and basic , but it be centrally located and very convinient .<ssssss>staff be very helpful , especially mari cruz , she be a lot of help and very pleasent !!<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		clean , classy and solid just get back to atlanta this afternoon and think i would share my thought .<ssssss>i unfortunately have to transfer out of my original hotel after the first night there -lrb- the bridge hotel , where i be assign to a anfully depressing basement room with non-stop construction noise ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i be fearful about try to find another last minute , with a convention go on in town , but the nh city centre have some availabity so i walk over there to check it out .<ssssss>end up stay for 4 day and have a very good experience .<ssssss>the location be really prime , along the picturesque singel canal on the one side , and the bustling spuistraat , on the other .<ssssss>convenient to central station , all the great walking neighborhood , shopping , food , etc. the hotel also arrange a shuttle to and from the airport every hour , which be a additional 11 euro each way , but be very convenient .<ssssss>the room be immaculate and very tastefully design , recently renovate , and on the contemporary side .<ssssss>great canal view , large window .<ssssss>bathroom in great shape , and extremely clean .<ssssss>staff be by and large quite curtious and helpful and knowledgable .<ssssss>i only eat one meal there , a buffet breakfast , which be pretty well do if a bit pricey at 13.50 euro -lrb- amsterdam have get to be so expensive ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>my biggest complaint be that the cleaning staff get a little too zealous in the morning , and have begin make a racket in the hallway on sunday morning at 9:30 .<ssssss>not so cool , but not a deal breaker .<ssssss>all in all , i highly recommend this hotel , and will likely stay there again next trip .<ssssss>
2 1 1 4 1 3 2 -1		big disappointment go there for a weekend getaway .<ssssss>very disappointed at the low level of service : no room service during the day -lrb- after 5:30 only -rrb- , stain on the sheet , loud a/c that be alternately freezing and hot stuffy , bellman about run I down as i be try to get out of the elevator , furniture get pretty worn , bad breakfast.will not be back and can not recommend it .<ssssss>2 star hotel at a 4 star rate .<ssssss>
3 2 2 -1 5 -1 4 -1		mixed bag we stay at hotel lavoiser for 4 night this june .<ssssss>the staff be lovely , accomodate and knowledgeable about local restaurant and venue .<ssssss>the hotel be well maintain and very clean .<ssssss>they seem to cater to a english speaking clientale and most guest apppear to be american or british .<ssssss>on the down side , we room be very small and the accomadation be in no way equal to american property .<ssssss>the tv be teeny and pull out from a closet .<ssssss>the room be quiet but we view be of a unattractive apartment building .<ssssss>the bathroom be update with a bath but again teeny .<ssssss>we mattress be uncomfortable .<ssssss>for 4 night which include continental breakfast , we bill be over $ 1000.00 .<ssssss>this include $ 30.00 in access phone charge to be able to use we prepaid phone card .<ssssss>compare to mid range american property such as doubletree or holiday inn , we be disappoint .<ssssss>but perhaps , it be unfair to compare paris hotel to those in the state .<ssssss>paris be charming , the french people be wonderful to we and we have a great time on we vacation .<ssssss>but in term to hotel value , there be no place like home .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 4 3 4 1		have potential but not quite there yet i have very mixed feeling about we stay at this resort .<ssssss>some thing be excellent - other not so .<ssssss>i think it be absolutely true - you get what you pay for so if you do not pay for a 5 star resort you should not expect a 5 star resort.we be originally book to stay at the allegro -lrb- now sunscape -rrb- first club resort .<ssssss>due to overbook - which seem suspicious in of itself - we be move to the ifa villa bavaro .<ssssss>review on tripadvisor seem fairly similar before we left.we be a group of 5 staying in 2 room .<ssssss>on arrival , check-in be a bit disorganized - no lineup just a bunch of people crowd around a desk .<ssssss>so it can be a bit frustrating if a large group be ahead of you .<ssssss>i tell the reservation that we reservation be 2 room .<ssssss>we be not give adjacent room - in fact they be not even close to each other .<ssssss>my initial room be 1224 - so far away that they have a golf cart tram to take you there .<ssssss>i would say walk it be 500m away from the main reception and another 300m or more to the beach .<ssssss>-lrb- they do have another shuttle to the beach although it be a nice walk there -rrb- .<ssssss>on check in to the room - no towel , no toilet paper .<ssssss>a phone call be make - it come 2 hour later .<ssssss>luckily i have bring my own.the room i would say be 3 * in quality .<ssssss>they have a nice 27 plasma tv with lot of channel -lrb- satellite -rrb- - include multilingual .<ssssss>unfortunately some of the hotel channel keep show graphic porn so if you be channel surf it can be a bit annoying .<ssssss>there be no wi-fi in the room - they say there be dsl cable on the tv for internet but when you call the front desk they say no .<ssssss>the only internet be this small hut where you have to book time in advance -lrb- $ 1us for 30minute -rrb- - 2 computer .<ssssss>i book time everyday .<ssssss>but slot be always full .<ssssss>i usually book the day before.there be no toiletries .<ssssss>no kleenex or tissue .<ssssss>there be a dispenser on the wall with 3 slot but only one of the slot be fill with a white liquid .<ssssss>shampoo ?<ssssss>soap ?<ssssss>the other room -lrb- my sister 's -rrb- the dispenser be broken.the bed be fine - and i think the shower be very nice .<ssssss>no bathtub.housekeeping be variable .<ssssss>sometimes they come in the morning , sometimes not until the evening .<ssssss>towel be take out separately in the morning and new one be provide in the afternoon or early evening .<ssssss>so there be no towel in the room mid-day .<ssssss>on the second day we insist on be move to a closer room and be move to room 1089 - much closer and this improve we enjoyment more.air conditioning be hard to control but we be glad to have it - it could either be too cold if leave on -lrb- even though there be a thermostat -rrb- or too hot if leave on .<ssssss>ceiling fan as well but rather noisy .<ssssss>no clockradio in the room so bring you own.small fridge which be replenish with 2 medium size bottle of bottled water daily.ice bucket but never see a ice machine while we be there .<ssssss>small clothesline outside be a nice touch for you wet stuff - 2 patio chair and a small table as well .<ssssss>many people leave stuff overnight .<ssssss>but my sister have a towel steal and i actually have a towel take -lrb- which be later return -rrb- as well so leave out at you own risk.we tip we housekeeper every day and at the end and it be much appreciate .<ssssss>the beach be very very nice and we walk to it .<ssssss>lot of lounge chair never a problem but we be morning people .<ssssss>around the pool -lrb- 3 gorgeous pool -rrb- , the towel reservation system be work .<ssssss>never bother by people sell stuff i do not think they be allow .<ssssss>spa people gently approach you at time on walkway but not a issue at all .<ssssss>at the beach - lot of topless sunbathing.this resort be almost exclusively european .<ssssss>english be hardly speak here and i would say it be primarily people from france , italy , germany , and spain who be there we week .<ssssss>some staff speak basic english but i would not try anything conversational .<ssssss>some reception staff do not speak english.drinks be super sweet and not premium alcohol .<ssssss>pina colada come out of a machine and be highly variable depend on where i get it .<ssssss>sometimes it be like a ice drink , other time it be a warm drink , i think the coffee bar/cafe serve the best drink and coffee .<ssssss>the food to I be the worst part of this resort and i like everything .<ssssss>breakfast be fine .<ssssss>entertaining omelette guy .<ssssss>it be hard to mess up breakfast .<ssssss>at the main restaurant they have a pasta bar and a grill area .<ssssss>we enjoy that .<ssssss>but the food be just adequate .<ssssss>i would say at the level of a high school cafeteria .<ssssss>or so .<ssssss>the most disappointing restaurant experience be the a la carte restaurant .<ssssss>you must make reservation in advance .<ssssss>the oriental restaurant be a beautiful room but portion be small and we could have eat more afterwards .<ssssss>some of the meat be tough .<ssssss>the mexican restaurant be buffet style and reasonable in quality but a confusing layout create two way buffet traffic and the grill seem overwhelm .<ssssss>the caribe restaurant serve beautiful look food that taste fine but we food be cold when it arrive .<ssssss>another group go to the buffet after caribe and say they meat be tough.i get a bit of traveller diarrhea towards the end of the week and my mother a mild case when she return home.the gym be quite good - i be surprise .<ssssss>weight machine - 2 treadmill , 2 elliptical , 2 bike , free weight , mat .<ssssss>air condition .<ssssss>i do not go into the spa but the entrance be the same as the gym and be very nice.i do water aerobics and stretch on the beach with the animation crew .<ssssss>the first couple day the stretch on the beach be excellent .<ssssss>the second day he hand over he duty to this girl who basically make thing up as she go along -lrb- stretch each finger ? -rrb-<ssssss>and quit after 20 minutes.evening entertainment be hit and miss .<ssssss>my parent enjoy the musical show -lrb- which start at 10pm -rrb- .<ssssss>there be one night where they do a miss ifa villa bavaro contest with people from the audience that some might consider offensive - it include have the woman simulate lap dancing on a man from the crowd who be tie up .<ssssss>and although i have leave by then , later on there be a racially insensitive skit involve ask one of the contestant to act like a chinese person and give some prop - be of asian descent i be glad i be not there but my brother-in-law do speak to the manager the next day -lrb- nothing happen -rrb- .<ssssss>i believe another review on tripadvisor allude to this skit.local call be not free - we make four rather quick local call and end up pay $ 13us .<ssssss>we be tell the rate before we make the call but they have a very suspicious exchange rate and really you do not have much say unless you take out peso which i would not recommend.checkout be straightforward for we .<ssssss>we pre-arranged airport transfer be no problem at all .<ssssss>however , a nice couple i meet actually miss they flight because checkout take so long at the hotel .<ssssss>i do not get the exact detail - we have a brief conversation at the airport - but he be furious - and it seem like a large group be either check out in front of them.the grounds of this resort be beautiful .<ssssss>absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>in layout , in maintenance and in cleanliness .<ssssss>just wonderful .<ssssss>this resort have the potential to make itself into a 4 * or 5 * resort if it upgrade the food and the room .<ssssss>i think all the staff be wonderful , hard working and polite .<ssssss>-lrb- we tip everywhere though - every meal , every drink , housekeeping - and we certainly do not see much tip go on -rrb- i would stay at this resort again if i know that the room be upgrade and if i know that the food have improve .<ssssss>if i be to return i would not bother with the a la carte restaurant .<ssssss>-lrb- note that they do have nicer room but we be tell we would have to pay extra and that sunscape/allegro do not pay for we to be in those room . -rrb-<ssssss>

time you lose water while showering .<ssssss>you would have to wait a couple of minute to have the hot water restore and then you have to hurry before it leave again and be stick with cold water .<ssssss>there be no elevator in the building , so if you do not want to climb stair , ask for a first floor room .<ssssss>the pool area be nice and so be the bartender .<ssssss>only down side be that you have to walk all the way to the beach to get towel , and sometimes they be out .<ssssss>they should have a towel cart by the pool , but do not .<ssssss>let 's talk about the food .<ssssss>for the most part the food be good .<ssssss>the buffet be plentiful , you could always find something to eat .<ssssss>however , after have to eat at the buffet 6 of the 7 night , it become monotonous and wish for something different .<ssssss>at time it take several attempt to get silverware and drink once seat at a table .<ssssss>on a good note , we do come into contact with both of the buffet supervisor who be very accommodate and helpful .<ssssss>they both make every effort to make sure we be take care of .<ssssss>as for the other smaller restaurant that be available , if you do not get there early -lrb- 6:30 p.m. -rrb- you will have to wait 2 hour and once you do get in , you be tell that they have already run out of certain food .<ssssss>one of the wait staff actually tell we that we should have come earlier if we want to have shrimp .<ssssss>not the right thing to say after sit and wait for more than a hour .<ssssss>as for margarita and the italian restaurant , well we never be able to eat there .<ssssss>there be always too long of a wait and after the the first experience at casa de mi abuela , we opt for the buffet .<ssssss>as for room service , if you do not purchase the upgrade package , they tell you that you be not entitle to it or you must pay extra for it.this be a very large resort and we think it be understaff for the quanity of people that be vacation .<ssssss>we be all spanish speaking , but do notice that at time english only guest be not treat the same as the spanish speaking guest .<ssssss>mike 's coffee shop be definitely the best .<ssssss>we group consist of five couple and each of we experience some sort of inconvenience .<ssssss>we room key would unexpectedly stop work .<ssssss>at one point we have 7 room key and only one of they work .<ssssss>another couple be tell that they have check they out on tuesday , despite the fact that there be not check out until saturday .<ssssss>they be actually tell by the front desk that they need to leave that room because someone else be suppose to be in they room .<ssssss>they end up stay in they room .<ssssss>as for the night life , the disco be fun .<ssssss>the dj be well mean but do not know how to mix music very well .<ssssss>bartender ... if you want a drink that be something other then rum and coke , you better tell they what you want in it otherwise you be not go to like what you get .<ssssss>as for tour , we really have a great time on the jeep safari .<ssssss>highly recommend it .<ssssss>it be a all day tour that take you into the back country , mountain and beach .<ssssss>lot of dirt road and bumpy but a lot of fun .<ssssss>the tour to catalina island be disappointing .<ssssss>two hour bus ride there , then a short amphibious boat ride , beautiful scenery , visit to lo altos de chavon and then the boat ride to catalina island .<ssssss>make sure to bring insect repellent !<ssssss>there be huge blood sucking fly there .<ssssss>while on the island you be give lunch .<ssssss>it be suppose to be a all you can eat type with lobster be the main selling point .<ssssss>what they do not tell you be that the lobster tail be split in half and they be the size of langostino .<ssssss>certainly not what the tour guide make it sound like .<ssssss>the tour take a lot longer than they have say as well .<ssssss>we leave the hotel at 7:15 a.m. and do not return until 9:00 p.m. make sure to eat breakfast and take snack for later because it will be a long day .<ssssss>as for shopping , the best price we get be at the beach market .<ssssss>you must negotiate with the vendor because they know you be tourist and they double the price on everything.all and all , the hotel be very pretty and clean , however , it would be better if they make improvement in they administration and staffing .<ssssss>we have a really fun group of people which make all the inconvenience tolerable .<ssssss>
4 5 5 5 5 2 4 3		do not believe the negative hype !<ssssss>my pet peeve on tripadvisor be how a hotel can end up with a low star rating because reviewer be unhappy with they experience because of something like the airline or the weather .<ssssss>the hotel can not control those thing !<ssssss>i be concern about the barcelo because of the low star rating , but after spend 5 day there , i swear i would post a review so that it do not get a bad rap over thing beyond its control .<ssssss>we have just return from we vacation and love every minute we spend at the barcelo .<ssssss>the room be exactly as describe and picture on they website .<ssssss>the hotel be undergo renovation and we have a newly remodel room that be lovely and overlook the pool and the ocean .<ssssss>the maid staff keep the room spotless and the mini bar stay stock with beverage .<ssssss>room service be a additional charge , but we be happy to partake in the food downstairs .<ssssss>there be 6 or 7 different resturaunt to choose from .<ssssss>there be 2 buffet to choose from for breakfast and lunch and both be pleasant .<ssssss>my husband and i have simple food taste , thus can sometimes be picky eater , but be always able to find plenty to fill we plate .<ssssss>the late night buffet offer hamburger and fry chicken that we enjoy several time , there be never a shortage of thing to do at the hotel and the activity staff be invite and fun .<ssssss>there be even a rock climb wall and a trapeeze you could give a try .<ssssss>the casino be unforgiving , but still fun to try out .<ssssss>there be a nightly show offer at the theatre .<ssssss>the beach and the pool be immaculate .<ssssss>a couple of night a week they even vendor in to sell local wares , you truly never have to leave the resort .<ssssss>but if you want to , there be a guide in the lobby each morning that can set you up with whatever activity you be look to do , i.e. horseback ride , scuba diving , sailing , deep sea fishing , etc. he talk we into a horse back ride / dune buggy adventure that be a blast!the only downside be the front desk and the check in process .<ssssss>any time we go by the front desk there be always a line wait as they generally only have 1 or 2 people work it at a time .<ssssss>and it seem most of the employee there only know enough key phrase in english to do they job .<ssssss>so speak spanish , at least a limited amount , definitely helps.the weather be fabulous !<ssssss>i truly can not say enough good thing about this vacation .<ssssss>generally , my husband and i have the philosophy that we never visit the same vacation spot twice , but we be willing to make a exception for punta cana and the barcelo .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 1 3 2 3		one of the worst we have stay at the marriott marquis be one of the worst hotel we have stay at and do not justify the price at all !<ssssss>the room and bathroom be small and old .<ssssss>the shower do not work - all the water come out of the bath tap and not the shower head .<ssssss>it be only fix after 2 request .<ssssss>however this do not change the fact that there be no hot water during we stay.the sheet be dirty - it have blood stain on it the first night we get there !!<ssssss>the towel be also dirty - i find hair on my bath towel -lrb- which by the way , be the mere size of two handtowel -rrb- .<ssssss>the light be also extremely annoying - there be no master light switch , so at night when you want to go to sleep - you will have to manually switch off every single light in the room.elevators be hopeless - have to wait for age each time to get a lift.great location - however do not stay here if you want quiet and peace .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		affinia a disappointment i pick the affinia 50 because of its positive tripadvisor review , but the hotel be a disappointment .<ssssss>i ask for a quiet room , but be give a room on a low floor , between the stair and the elevator , and directly above the exhaust fan for a nearby business ; i expect to have to pay for internet access , and while they do provide a network cable , there be no place to plug it in -- the room have never be wire for internet ; i expect a kitchenette and get just a coffeemaker ; heck , i expect function air conditioning , but that be break too !<ssssss>on a day when the outside temperature peak at 60 degree , the room be 80 degree all night long .<ssssss>-lrb- and forget open the window for ventilation ; the noise from the nearby fan be enough to prevent conversation with the window open . -rrb-<ssssss>on the positive side , the room be spacious for new york , the bed be comfortable -lrb- down duvet , synthetic pillow -rrb- , and everything be clean .<ssssss>i be never stay here again .<ssssss>

2 1 5 -1 5 -1 1 -1		horrible service , very expensive , beautiful area we stay at the hilton hawaiian village during low season -lrb- early december -rrb- .<ssssss>when we first arrive we be in awe by the beauty of it all .<ssssss>then the trouble begin .<ssssss>i be a diamond level hilton honor member -lrb- it do not get higher than that -rrb- .<ssssss>upon check in , i be practically accuse of have a fake certificate to stay there .<ssssss>the service overall at the hotel be horrible .<ssssss>absolutely rude .<ssssss>the staff make you feel like they hate you be there and that you be bother they when you ask they to do they job .<ssssss>no one can offer you direction .<ssssss>no one can recommend a restaurant .<ssssss>everyone just want to sell you something.the parking be $ 12 per day -lrb- no other choice -rrb- a buffet run $ 35 per person for less than average food .<ssssss>the shop and restaurant in the village be ridiculously overprice .<ssssss>lunch special start at about $ 25 per person -lrb- and these do not include anything other than a basic entree , no side , no drink , nothing -rrb- so you will easily spend $ 40 per person for a meal .<ssssss>be ready to pay $ 50 for a t-shirt ... overall i could have stomach the price if the staff be half way decent .<ssssss>they be just too rude to even describe .<ssssss>how about this : we be eat breakfast outside at the beach front cafe , where pigeon and/or seagull would come onto the table to eat we food .<ssssss>no big deal for a animal lover .<ssssss>well i take a piece of my bagel and crumble it on the floor so they would keep off my plate and eat from the floor .<ssssss>the floor sweeper then come and slam a sign in front of my plate that say , please do not feed the bird .<ssssss>because he be upset that he have to sweep the crumb up .<ssssss>i mean , if i want to , i could have report this man for assault !<ssssss>what kind of a person slam a sign onto you breakfast plate ???<ssssss>it be all too bad , because the place be beautiful .<ssssss>we room be gorgeous , clean , and have a spectacular view of beach and mountain .<ssssss>so beautiful that i probably would go back again if i get the room for free again .<ssssss>however , i would never pay the $ 350 - $ 400 per night .<ssssss>not for that kind of service .<ssssss>
2 1 5 4 4 3 1 3		luxury hotel next to central park with arrogant staff !<ssssss>american hotel staff be usually better than in europe .<ssssss>very well train and very friendly .<ssssss>not as good as asia though .<ssssss>in the mandarin oriental the staff be however arrogant .<ssssss>they think you have to be glad to be allow there .<ssssss>which be not acceptable when you pay $ 1500 a night!yes , i sit next to lawrence fishburn in the bar and they be all over he , but i nearly could not get a seat .<ssssss>bar , restaurant and lounge be way to small , the food and drink selection be poor and extremely expensive for what it be .<ssssss>we like to have long breakfast and be push to leave after we have eat .<ssssss>we then go to have breakfast in the landmark restaurant in the shopping center.to top it all up the concierge comment when i dislike he restaurant suggestion : if you look for a cheaper place , then ... finally the bar refuse to serve we drink on new year at 1am .<ssssss>be close now ... that be the city that never sleep ?<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 3 4 3 3		disappointing for a holiday inn we probably make a mistake at check in .<ssssss>we have book a non smoking room .<ssssss>we be give a choice â€?a non smoking room in a separate annex block , or a upgrade room in the hotel itself â€?albeit a smoking room .<ssssss>after a 11 hour flight and no sleep for nearly 24 hour i can not always think too clearly ; i pick the upgrade .<ssssss>the word â€˜Annexâ€?conveys the impression of something tack on and â€˜upgradeâ€?of unexpected benefit and luxury .<ssssss>when we get to the room , i couldnâ€™t help but think â€œif this be the upgrade , then i wonder what the standard room be likeâ€ ?<ssssss>i wouldnâ€™t go as far as to say it be awful , but it be certainly very tired and in desperate need of refurbishment .<ssssss>it also have a hint of that nasty odour cause by stale cigarette smoke which i suppose be not unexpected .<ssssss>in short , it be disappointing .<ssssss>if it wasnâ€™t for the fact we be cross eye with tiredness couple with the knowledge we be only there for one night , i would probably have request a different room .<ssssss>on the cleanliness front , i would describe it as reasonably clean but not spotlessly clean .<ssssss>with regard to the heating/air conditioning arrangement , there do not seem to be much variance between hot and cold on the rather ancient unit .<ssssss>fortunately , neither be really necessary ; we have excellent weather for january .<ssssss>on the positive side , there be complimentary internet access on the floor -lrb- part of the â€˜upgradeâ€?package -rrb- , as well as a decent size fridge in the room .<ssssss>we find the staff to be helpful and pleasant , particularly the concierge .<ssssss>we didnâ€™t eat in the hotel ; breakfast seem expensive for what it be , but there be a number of place just a few minute walk away from the hotel that do breakfast for just a few dollar .<ssssss>for dinner , i have do a little bit of research before we arrive .<ssssss>seem to I that while there be indeed load of restaurant in the vicinity , none seem to stand out as be particularly remarkable .<ssssss>so we pick out one in the russian hill district call antica trattoria on polk street -lrb- at union -rrb- .<ssssss>it be a â€˜neighbourhoodâ€?restaurant -lrb- ie frequent by local -rrb- â€?always a good sign in my experience .<ssssss>it be excellent -lrb- you can look it up by tap the name into google -rrb- .<ssssss>about a 10-12 minute walk from the hotel , up a steep hill â€?but itâ€™s downhill on the way back !<ssssss>cost we approx Â£30 a head with all drink include a very pleasant bottle of napa valley pinot noir â€?a good meal for a fair price .<ssssss>after we get back to the hotel , we have a quick night cap in the bar .<ssssss>we find the barman to be helpful and knowledgeable.noting some of the previous comment over the â€˜tackinessâ€?of the area â€?it certainly be in place .<ssssss>it would be unfair to label the whole area in that way though .<ssssss>â€˜Touristyâ€?it certainly be â€?and we know that when we book .<ssssss>overall though we find the area to be quite pleasant with a relax atmosphere ; the nearby cannery certainly fall into that category .<ssssss>from that perspective , the hotel be very well located .<ssssss>i would only stay at this hotel again if i know that the room have be refurbish .<ssssss>as it be , it be singularly unremarkable .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 4 5 4 2		enjoy we stay !<ssssss>we stay at the sant from sept 24th-oct1st .<ssssss>we be greetly warmly and the hotel staff be very helpful thoughout we stay .<ssssss>they be quick to give we info on place to see , thing to do and how to get to they .<ssssss>it be a perfect location with the train , bus and subway connected underneath the hotel.in that station you will also find a mcdonald and shopping which be nice if you do not want to run out someplace far.the bed be very comfortable and the room be very clean .<ssssss>the only negative would be that the breakfast be a bit on the expensive side and not all that good .<ssssss>we do not try any other meal there to compare .<ssssss>also the internet be not free and be expensive as well.i would reccomend this hotel with confidence .<ssssss>i<ssssss>
4 5 3 3 4 3 5 -1		decent hotel basic accommodation , large and clean though .<ssssss>very good value for money , book a all inclusive package .<ssssss>all restaurant be lovely , with lot of choice and great food.massive great pool with swim up bar .<ssssss>good facility , pool , table tennis , archery , watersport .<ssssss>good for family with kid and couple .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 3 2 1 2		no phone , terrible service , do not recommend !<ssssss>the hotel stay be terrible .<ssssss>the phone do not work for the first 3-4 day of the stay and the hotel refuse to compensate we or get we a better room that have a work phone .<ssssss>the service here be horrible - i have people try to reach I for several day before the hotel staff be able to figure out that send they to my room line be not actually work .<ssssss>i would recommend to anyone thinking of stay here to spend some extra money and go elsewhere .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 3 5 3 5		miramar riverside , good location , excellent service .<ssssss>spend 6 day at miramar .<ssssss>find staff to be of high standards.nothing be a problem for they , even local information regard tour and price at marketsand bus time and which one to catch.restuarant serve good food and cater for local as well as fussy aussies.buffet breakfast be great.the 2 complaint i have be :1 / the bed be too hard for I , -lsb- but i like soft bed -rsb- a lot would find it great .2 / there be black long -lsb- not short and curly -rsb- hair everywhere in bathroom -lsb- as bathroom be white it be easy to see -rsb- and in a tea cup.after that i rinsed cup out with boiling water before using.i have use the teaspoon to eat a cream -lsb- chocolate -rsb- cake and that afternoon could see smear of cream residue on spoon as if it have be wipe with a cloth.there be a reveiw in 60 minute regard -lsb- in assie 5 star -rsb- hotel cleaner of room .<ssssss>this program make I aware of what cleaner actually clean and what they use to clean !<ssssss>i always think they replace cup and glass everyday but it doesnt appear so.i believe it must happen in most hotel worldwide .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 3 3 -1		hotel to the max !<ssssss>i stay at the hotel max in seattle for 4 night at the beginning of november , and i love it !<ssssss>i have a room with 2 double bed , and it be just the right size , and the bathroom be also a decent size .<ssssss>note , this be the most comfortable hotel bed and linen i have ever sleep in , all 4 night i sleep like a baby !<ssssss>the hotel be very funky , probably more so for 20 - 30-something .<ssssss>it be in a very convenient area , close to everything , and a short walk to pike place market and lot of other shopping , movie , and restaurant .<ssssss>my only gripe be the parking cost , which be $ 22 valet , just be careful that even though i only use valet for 2 night , they charge I for all 4 night automatically , so make sure to double-check you bill .<ssssss>overall it be a wonderful experience and i be sure to be back !<ssssss>
4 5 4 3 5 5 3 5		great place for a second stay !!!<ssssss>okay , let 's give this boutique hotel a exhaustive review because the property have earn a fair shake .<ssssss>if this be you first trip to hong kong and likely to be you one and only visit , start look elsewhere and be prepare to pay for you stay !<ssssss>most importantly , do not complain - you will get that for which you will pay !<ssssss>the great thing about hong kong , as oppose to shanghai , be that you money have value .<ssssss>despite pay for service find want -lrb- e.g. westin - shanghai -rrb- or pay for room which should have a view and do not -lrb- e.g. westin - shanghai -rrb- , hong kong have great hotel in great place like the admiralty and central area .<ssssss>be prepare to pay for the harbor view , bite you lip and shell out the dough .<ssssss>you will get you money 's worth and everyone will be pleased.however , if this be you second , third or fourth trip to hong kong , then the rosedale on the park -lrb- much like the royal park in sha tin -rrb- be a real treat .<ssssss>the property be clean as a whistle , situate close to the tram for endless tramming for penny and close to the bus stop for cheap ride around town , as well as up to the peak -lrb- # 15 -rrb- and over to the star ferry -lrb- # 8 -rrb- .<ssssss>the elderly should be cognizant that stay at this little wonder will require a fair amount of walk unless the local cab -lrb- ready and wait -rrb- be use for quick trip to the shopping area in reasonable proximity -lrb- time square and the island area -rrb- .<ssssss>do not be discourage - all the hotel require a little hoofing .<ssssss>between rosedale on the park and the park lane , the junior suite at the rosedale be a much better deal than a standard room at the park lane .<ssssss>they be more than likely price comparably and the junior suite be a far superior deal .<ssssss>the park lane appear , deceivingly , to be a better deal , but the rosedale on the park simply shine .<ssssss>a great fish venue be right across the street and a more than reliable steakhouse be right around the corner .<ssssss>a 7-11 be close , too .<ssssss>the junior suite at the rosedale be a great deal and perfect for stay of three day or more .<ssssss>also , the local grocery store be 5 minute away where water , coffee , banana , orange and simple staple -lrb- cookie -rrb- can be purchase to defray otherwise unnecessary expenditure .<ssssss>the junior suite be superbly well equip with a microwave , iron board , electric coffee/tea pot , safe , bar sink , internet access and two tee-vee .<ssssss>the bathroom be kind of small -lrb- not enough room to swing a cat around -rrb- , but immaculately clean and the towel be fresh everyday , friendly and plump .<ssssss>the rosedale , like the royal park hotel , be a great value .<ssssss>the staff at the front desk be great - the concierge and guy at the front door should invest in a aloha shirt and learn from the hawaiian -lrb- you only get one chance to make a first impression -rrb- .<ssssss>overall , a great find and a wonderful place to stay in hong kong , especially if you know you way around .<ssssss>if you do not , ride the tram , take the bus , learn the layout and head back to the rosedale - a little home away from home .<ssssss>the rosedale get a good grade .<ssssss>very nicely do and very , very comfortable .<ssssss>hint : ask for the southwest or northwest view and try to get over the 25th floor .<ssssss>priceline europe provide a great rate .<ssssss>rating the dough for the deal - the rosedale be a big winner .<ssssss>

2 2 4 3 4 2 1 2		case study in poor customer service my husband and i recently stay at the ramada during a trip to bali to celebrate we anniversary .<ssssss>i have read trip advisor and be a bit wary of the negative comment for the hotel , but decide to give this hotel a try consider its reasonable rate .<ssssss>-lrb- we stay be plan for the end of a long trip in which we be stay at other hotel range from $ 225 to $ 250 a night , vs. $ 90 a night at the ramada . -rrb-<ssssss>overall , the hotel be better than the ramada in the we - the room while not luxurious be comfortable .<ssssss>we have already be to the gorgeous beach of canggu , seminyak , jimbaran , and nusa lemongan , so we do not mind that the beach attach to the ramada be not the nicest -lrb- per the other reviewer , it be indeed mire with boat and jet skii , and during low tide , be cover in seaweed rather than clean sand -rrb- .<ssssss>the tao restaurant have a nice pool and the food be reasonably price as well -lrb- ~ $ 50 per meal for 2 people with drink -rrb- .<ssssss>however , the experience break down when customer service be involve .<ssssss>first of all , i have book we room online , and when i try to email the hotel at the email list on they web site to confirm we reservation and to find out about when they late check out be , no one answer .<ssssss>i have email 6 time , and no answer .<ssssss>in fact , i have to get the concierge at another -lrb- far better -rrb- hotel in balus to confirm my reservation with the ramada .<ssssss>then there be the fact that the ramada would not help I book alternative transportation to the airport .<ssssss>they charge $ 15 per trip use they hotel shuttle , when a taxi should cost only $ 7 .<ssssss>when i ask they to book a car with a private driver we have find , they charge I $ 2 just to make the call .<ssssss>i be really appal that they would be so cheap consider we have not make any other customer service request of they .<ssssss>book a car for the airport should be the least that they could do for they customers.finally , there be a bill dispute that they fail miserably at handle -lrb- they charge we a full third day 's rate when they should have only charge we for a late check out on the third day -rrb- .<ssssss>the manager be completely unwilling to budge on this , give absolutely no concession or even a discount consider it be fully the hotel 's mistake .<ssssss>my husband and i discuss this and realize it be probably a directive from ramada 's central management not to let junior manager do what they need to to help they customer and ensure complete satisfaction .<ssssss>the difference between a full day and a half day 's rate be only $ 45 , but because they be unwilling to even consider this , they have lose we as customer for life .<ssssss>i be plan to write a strongly word letter to ramada central management about this issue , and would definitely never recommend ramada to any of my friend and associate .<ssssss>my husband be plan to use we experience at the ramada in he company presentation of how not to manage customer service , and i be plan to submit this case to my business school as well as a case study in poor customer service management.in short - if you wish to truly experience the luxury , comfort , and amazing customer service that bali have to offer , pay a little more and stay at the myriad other hotel in south balus - not the ramada .<ssssss>

3 4 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		the good , the bad and the ugly i call this review the good , the bad and the ugly because we have a bit of everything .<ssssss>i definatley do not want to write a negative review of we holiday but we have some experience that just be not good.our family of four , two adult and two child -lrb- 9 and 14 -rrb- stay at the bahia from feb 14 to 21 .<ssssss>we begin we stay in the regular part of the hotel in a main floor room and that be where we run into problem .<ssssss>the mosquito hang in the cool , dark alcove by the door to the main floor room and when the maid clean they leave the door to the room open .<ssssss>yes , despite we ask they not to , they leave the door open !<ssssss>we have at least fifty mosquito in we room every night and any part of the body which be not under a sheet during the night be cover in welt by morning .<ssssss>-lrb- bottom of foot , ankle , face , elbow etc. etc. -rrb- by day three we be all severely bite and when i talk to the guest service people they solution be to fog we room with insectiside .<ssssss>yikes !<ssssss>on day four we simply upgrade to a third floor room in the club diamond and it make a huge difference to the rest of we stay .<ssssss>if you can make the upgrade to a 2nd or 3rd floor room in diamond or golden club i would highly recommend it , i think i would be write a different review if we have access this from day one .<ssssss>the service be much better and there be some nice touch which make it feel more like a 5 * resort .<ssssss>you can have breakfast and lunch at a small buffet in one of the restaurant instead of the huge buffet which be much more pleasant .<ssssss>-lrb- avoid the smell of the big buffet -rrb- .<ssssss>i find the best food be the stuff which be cook in front of I .<ssssss>the egg at the omlette bar , the pizza and pasta be consistently good , the bread , most of the soup and dessert be good too .<ssssss>for the most part we experience in the al la carte be just bad , they try hard but the service be inconsistent at best , they be understaff and the meal be poorly time .<ssssss>the quality of the entree be poor , the food be cold , undercooked/overcooked , we get the full range of yuk !<ssssss>if you have be ill in other destination like this in the past the chance of you be ill here be good , lot of people be .<ssssss>i have grow a little complaisant because i have not be ill the past two time we have be in mexico but , both my daughter and i have upset stomach for the duration of this trip and i need immodium after eat the sushi in the japanese restaurant .<ssssss>my husband say the food be fine and have no problem but he also eat off of street cart in mexico without any ill affect .<ssssss>we do the outback safari tour and it be definatley the highlight of we trip .<ssssss>it be fantastic !!<ssssss>if you want to see the country and you do not have any back or neck issue -lrb- it be a rough ride in the back of a truck -rrb- then take this trip .<ssssss>you can get the detail about it on any of the dominican tour website .<ssssss>just a note , i take some school supplies and toy but they do not stop at the school anymore and they discourage tourist from give thing to the child on the street .<ssssss>the sheer number of tour stop at the school become very disruptive to the learning of the student .<ssssss>the child on the street be put themselves in dangerous situation -lrb- run into traffic -rrb- by chase the tour truck for trinket and some child be make a day job out of beg for stuff .<ssssss>if you choose to take gift the tour company go to the school once a month and deliver you gift .<ssssss>the school supplies be desperately need and it do not bother I at all that i do not get to deliver they personally .<ssssss>my daughter do give out some small toy when we be stop and off of the truck and it be not a problem.if you be commit to go to the punta cana bahia make sure you : 1 -rrb- do not accept a main floor room , deal with the main reception and the main guest service be a exercise in patience , they will leave you stand in line while one work and five of they socialize , they will pass you off from one person to another for no apparent reason -lrb- my husband and i call this the pedro show because they be all name pedro -rrb- , persevere with a sense of humor , it be worth it ; 2 -rrb- upgrade if you can , then you will have a private reception/guest service area where the service be really good ; 3 -rrb- take lot of 45 sun screen , bug spray , immodium , a antihistamine if you react to bug bite and something to take the itch off of the bug bites.the beauty of the resort and the country side be really stunning and its disappointing that we hit some hurdle which take a bit of the fun out of we trip .<ssssss>if you be look for a great sun/beach vacation , with a few precaution , i think it could be find at the bahia .<ssssss>

2 2 3 5 2 1 3 -1		poor reception the front desk staff give we a bad first impression .<ssssss>not one of they smile to the guest .<ssssss>in fact they only smile when they engage in they small talks.book a room prior to my trip , when we reach the hotel at 2.45 pm , but we be make to wait a hour at the lobby for the room to be clean up .<ssssss>none of the request -lrb- i.e. double bedroom , higher floor -rrb- that we put across when we book the room be fulfil .<ssssss>my wife and I have to make do with seperate bed and dummy window with the view of a back alley.i have stay at a nearby 3 star hotel before , they front desk give I better impression .<ssssss>if do not mind some poor front desk service , the hotel be situate at great location .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 1 4 3 1		good location but room below average ... i have spend 2 night there and in short : - room be indeed bigger than most other hotel in japan - no internet available in the room - bed be as hard as wood - the room cleanliness be well below average compare to what you usually get in japan -lrb- stain on the wall , on the carpet etc. .<ssssss>. -rrb-<ssssss>- despite have ask for a non smoking room , i get a stinky room with yellow wall , i believe the only difference they make between smoking and non-smoking room be that they give you a ashtray or not ... - i have not try the food , nor the breakfast , but there be anyway too many restaurant in the area to waste time in the hotel restaurant - the location be good , within walk distance of the hamamatsu-cho jr station next to the world trade center .<ssssss>you be also within walk distance of ginza , with some very interesting bar ... to conclude , i will personally never stay there again as i have see much better hotel in japan , and this one be definitely not worth the price you pay -lrb- 15.000 jpy per night for a double bed room -rrb- .<ssssss>

4 5 3 5 2 5 3 -1		great hotel for what we pay i , my husband and we 13 year old daughter take we first nyc trip at the end of july .<ssssss>i read some really mixed review of this hotel but for $ 219 dollar a night i almost could not pass it up .<ssssss>we get the city view and it be incredible .<ssssss>we could watch the hustle and bustle below and sometimes hear the street band play through we window .<ssssss>it be so conveniently located to time square and the comedy club across the street be awesome .<ssssss>the room be great , the bed be to die for .<ssssss>my own husband would not even let I sleep with he because he be not share such a great bed with anyone lol .<ssssss>bathroom could have be cleaner , but who really care .<ssssss>maid service be not great , but again who care .<ssssss>i guess the difference between the review you will read , and believe I i read alot , and my review be what i pay versus the rate you would normally pay .<ssssss>these room can go from 350 to 650 a room depend on the season .<ssssss>service be great , location great , hotel be beautiful .<ssssss>would i pay $ 600 a night ?<ssssss>no way .<ssssss>but if you want a great hotel , and catch a great deal , i would definitely stay here again .<ssssss>actually , i plan on go again in december of next year .<ssssss>if go visit texa barbque .<ssssss>good food , cheap drink great atmosphere , but then again , i be a native texan .<ssssss>i hope you enjoy nyc as much as i do .<ssssss>

1 1 1 3 2 4 4 3		older boutique hotel : small , dated room the room be very , very small and dreary .<ssssss>very little lighting , and very depressing .<ssssss>after a couple of hour in this room , i could not take it anymore and request a different room for a additional $ 20 charge .<ssssss>this be well worth it .<ssssss>the room i be move to be still old , dated and smell musty but be at least something that i could tolerate for 1 night .<ssssss>i be book for 2 , but when i advise the front desk that i simply could not stay there the 2nd night , they be accomodate and do not charge I the additional night 's penalty .<ssssss>they be also very polite about it .<ssssss>also note : this hotel be not for the claustrophobic !<ssssss>there be 1 extremely tiny elevator that have no air circulation .<ssssss>you can really tell that this be a older hotel .<ssssss>if you must stay here , without a doubt pay the extra $ 20 for a room upgrade .<ssssss>
2 3 2 2 5 4 5 -1		beautiful resort but not paradise for we the majestic colonial resort be a beautiful resort which have a lot to offer vacationer .<ssssss>the grounds be breathtaking and constantly be care for and the enormous pool be truly majestic and never feel crowd .<ssssss>the beach be lovely and you never have to worry about find a lounger or shade area if that be where you want to relax .<ssssss>the ocean temperature be actually warmer than the pool water and the beach be well take care of and clean daily by staff .<ssssss>the staff there be friendly and always courteous and always attempt to provide for you need to the best of they ability .<ssssss>we favorite restaurant be the gourmet restaurant and they service and four entree offer be excellent .<ssssss>the only consistent complaint i would have about the restaurant be that coffee be not readily available .<ssssss>the server would usually pour a half cup and many time it be prepoured and frequently not hot when it be serve .<ssssss>-lrb- i wonder if the availability of coffee bean be affect by previous storm as i never notice this at my stay in puerto plata several year ago . -rrb-<ssssss>unfortunately the weather during we stay be not ideal with lot of cloudy day and frequent heavy rain that make you entire vacation experience less than ideal .<ssssss>the hotel have no control over the weather but the little annoyance that you may not have notice become more pronounced when you be spend more time wander around the resort in the rain .<ssssss>be prepare to wear rubber sole sneaker as the beautiful tiled hallway and walkway be extremely slippery when wet especially during downpours.i do not want to sound like a complainer but would like to comment on some issue i encounter so that other guest may be able to avoid they in the future and enjoy they stay more .<ssssss>room it be a standard jr. suite in building 4 which be a ground floor room with we balcony face the construction area that be block by a black net .<ssssss>the construction work do start early and several night go late probably try to make up for lose hour due to heavy rainfall .<ssssss>-lrb- noise be a issue if you choose to use the patio but not hear inside room -rrb- the room be very large and we have no issue with the layout of this suite .<ssssss>the bed be fine but the pillow could be improve .<ssssss>the sofa be not comfortable -lrb- if you be sit in the sun this would not be a issue -rrb- and the fabric cover it and the bench appear dirty due to old stain .<ssssss>the increase moisture and ground floor location also contribute to increase number of centipede/inchworm type creature find inside we room throughout we stay .<ssssss>-lrb- the room be clean excellent by staff so cleanliness be not the contribute factor here . -rrb-<ssssss>we be unfortunately assign a room that have a door that would accomodate guest that want adjoining room .<ssssss>the door be extremely hollow and we could hear conversation of the guest in that room as if they be sit right next to you .<ssssss>circumstance have one family with children/baby cry which be tolerable but the last night we be awaken to new drunken guest scream and cursing at each other several time during the night .<ssssss>when we check in we be tell that the hotel be fully book so we do not request a room change .<ssssss>i would recommend request room on upper floor and not accept adjoing door suite to eliminate the problem i experience .<ssssss>entertainmentthe animation team work hard but i only do two dancing lesson as daytime activity .<ssssss>i do use the gym but be disappoint that the treadmill keep shut off on I after manually try to increase speed to increase my pace .<ssssss>i choose to walk around the perimeter of resort for exercise but that be interrupt by heavy downpour .<ssssss>the show at night be not impressive and it seem like the only other choice of entertainment be the sax and keyboard player who be good but it do become a little repetitive after two night .<ssssss>no activity available during rain that we be aware of .<ssssss>medical emergenciesdo not travel to punta cana unless you be independently wealthy or have travel insurance that cover unanticipated illness .<ssssss>my husband become violently ill with a bacterial gastrointestinal illness .<ssssss>i do not think it matter how or where he pick up this bacterium but i can assure you he have travel all over the world include many third world country and know standard precaution to take to avoid these type illness .<ssssss>the hotel md be a pleasure to deal with and be very competent .<ssssss>my husband be send to private hospital for iv antibiotic and fluid by ambulance .<ssssss>the cost of these service be $ 400 and charge to my credit card .<ssssss>i just by chance remember that i have purchase travel insurance for the first time due to threat of hurricane and be pleasantly surprise that it cover medical emergency too .<ssssss>the hotel doctor do tell I to have the hospital contact the insurance company which i do when i arrive .<ssssss>the billing person keep tell I they do not take any we travel insurance but i insist they call prior to give they my credit card for guaranteed payment prior to treatment .<ssssss>she then inform I the insurance would pay but again want my credit card which i be reluctant to present .<ssssss>the hospital be very clean and of course we do have some communication difficulty as we do not speak spanish fluently but nothing insurmountable .<ssssss>the biggest problem be try to be discharge as they want guaranteed payment but be not accept verbal and written confirmation of payment by insurance company and appear to be insist on charge my credit card as oppose to insurance payment guarantee .<ssssss>i actually speak to insurance case manager several time via telephone and she say they have never encounter this before and she have deal with same facility on prior occasion .<ssssss>as we finally leave the hospital i observe another frustrated family deal with same issue of insurance guantee that we have .<ssssss>i recognize that this facility do not want vacationer to disappear without receive payment but when they be deal with internationally know insurance company there have to be a better way to a confirm coverage without cause patient and they family the increase stress .<ssssss>i would have be willig to use my credit card if that be procedure to get reimbursement from insurance company but they state they already guarantee payment and i do not want to be double bill for service .<ssssss>i also be not able to receive a write itemized list of supplies and cost of service when we leave hospital.i think a variety of circumstance such as the rainy weather , less than ideal room location , one bad meal result in bacterial infection and hospital experience will not bring I back to punta cana in the near future .<ssssss>if i do choose to return and want a quiet relaxing vacation and could be guarantee a upper level floor without adjoining door i would try the majestic again as it really be a magnificent property .<ssssss>suggestion to the management team at the majestic would be to make sure you have information and map of property in english and other languague for new arrival guest .<ssssss>also it would be a great if they actually have drink menu at the bar so guest could experiment with new drink and know what type of beverage be available and ingredient in they .<ssssss>
4 3 5 2 5 5 5 5		great service and facility , ok location we have a very pleasant stay in late oct 2008 .<ssssss>the service from the front desk staff be absolutely outstanding , and very friendly and personal .<ssssss>the room be great and house keep staff be also outstanding , friendly and efficient.unfortunately , we be not that impressed with the in house restaraunt , although we do only use they for one breakfast .<ssssss>the food be ok , and the service be well mean , but impersonal , flustered and inept.overall , while the location be not ideal the facility and service be mostly outstanding and we would consider stay there again .<ssssss>
3 3 5 4 4 2 4 3		some change would make it great ... my parent , who live in puerto rico , enjoy spend one weekend during the summer at one of the resort throughout the island every year -lrb- and they like to treat they kid and they spouse -rrb- .<ssssss>after 2 year stay at the el conquistador , we decide to give the gran melia puerto rico a chance .<ssssss>my parent have stay here before -lrb- when it be the all inclusive paradisus -rrb- .<ssssss>however , my wife and i have not .<ssssss>structurally , from the outside , the hotel do not look like much .<ssssss>however , once you enter the lobby area , it be a beautiful resort and nicely decorate .<ssssss>the pool area be the main focal point and it be also very nice .<ssssss>the room be some of the largest and nicest i have come across -lrb- with large bathroom , large balcony , and marble throughout -rrb- .<ssssss>instead of one large high rise building , the hotel be spread out with one main building housing the lobby , casino , shop and restaurant , and several bungalow where all the room be located .<ssssss>these be spread out throughout the property .<ssssss>we be in bungalow 10 , and even though it be not the farthest one from the main building , it be still a 1/4 mile walk .<ssssss>-lrb- distance be mark along the path -rrb- .<ssssss>golf cart be constantly go by take guest from build to building , but do not hold you breath for one .<ssssss>during the 3 day and 2 night we be there , i be only able to ride they once .<ssssss>this hotel become a melia resort a few month ago , and unfortunately , the transition seem to be hurt they some .<ssssss>i hope that they can iron the problem because it be the only way that it can truly be a 5 star resort .<ssssss>we encounter some problem , which could have ruin we vacation , however , we try to make the most of it : - check in : veeeery slow .<ssssss>we arrive at 6:00 pm .<ssssss>we reservation be nowhere to be find and they try to convince we that we have only reserved one room and the hotel be full to capacity -lrb- i be not plan on spending my vacation share a room with my wife along with my parent ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i ask the lady to allow I to look up my email account where i have save my confirmation which obviously state two room .<ssssss>magically , the second room appear .<ssssss>finally , one hour and 10 minute after arrive at the hotel , we be on we way to we room .<ssssss>the golf cart be nowhere to be find , and after wait some more , we decide to walk the 1/4 mile to we bungalow .<ssssss>unfortunately the luggage do not arrive until 9:00 pm -lrb- 3 hour after we first arrive -rrb- !<ssssss>we keep call , and call and they keep say that they be very busy -lrb- and apparently the front desk team be also understaff -rrb- .<ssssss>- the room : as mention before , it be one of the nicest room i have ever have at any resort .<ssssss>the only negative be that there be three phone , but the only one that work be the one in the bathroom by the toilet !<ssssss>- housekeeping : we leave we room at 7:00 am and return at 4:00 pm only to find out that the room have not be clean .<ssssss>we call for clean towel which be deliver promptly .<ssssss>the maid knock on we door around 5:00 pm , but by then , we do not care about have we bed make so we thank she but tell she not to worry .<ssssss>once again , i believe they housekeeping team be also understaff .<ssssss>- food : the only place to eat something without get rape with the price be the grill by the pool .<ssssss>even though $ 13.50 for a burger be insulting , we expect these price since this be a resort .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be $ 23 per person .<ssssss>dinner at the tepanyaki restaurant be $ 39 per person .<ssssss>even though the food be obviously overprice , it be very good .<ssssss>we do feel sorry about we waiter at the restaurant for dinner .<ssssss>usually , at resort , and in order to maintain the service that be expect , you would expect several people serve you at once .<ssssss>we poor waiter be do a excellent job , but he be all by himself , run like crazy between 2 tepanyakus table with 10 people at each one , cleaning , bussing , take order , serve drink , clean again , serve dessert , and still manage to keep a smile .<ssssss>dinner be a 2 hour affair , mostly wait and watch we waiter run from one table to another , but the food be very good .<ssssss>once again , the problem here seem to be with staffing.-entertainment : we go to the bar area after dinner , where they have live music , feature traditional and fun music from the island .<ssssss>it be definitely very entertaining .<ssssss>after that , we go to the casino which be terribly small , but we be not big gambler so we do not care much .<ssssss>after that , we return to we room where we attempt to get a movie on pay per view , only to find out that we could not order because the hotel reservation system do not show anybody check in to we room -lrb- ?? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>they promise to fix it , but after wait for 20 minute , we decide to give up on that idea.facilities : very nice , but some construction go on as part of the transition .<ssssss>it do not bother we too much , but there be some jack-hammering during the day which do not mix too well with the serene atmosphere of a beach resort .<ssssss>overall this resort will be great once all of the problem mostly cause by understaffing and renovation be address , but the experience we have be somewhat dissapointing.the rate be great , but after stay there , we understand why this resort be mysteriously price substantially lower than all the other resort in the island ...<ssssss>

4 5 3 4 5 5 5 3		great hotel the hotel be nice , the location appear out of the way but be within walk or bus service .<ssssss>the hotel have gtreat acce to the 24 hour bus service and the touris area be not far.the hotel be nice but can be exspensive for thing like cup of tea how ever come out of the hotel and there be another hotel with a sport bar which be good in term of food and drink .<ssssss>around the corner from the hotel be a corner shop so do not use the mini bar .<ssssss>for a five star hotle it do not have tea make facility or iron facilities.breakfast be great , the hotel be clean just like berlin ; do not forget you bathing suit as there be a swimming pool and sauna .<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 3 3 3 2		cheaply renovate - i will not be go back either aside from the still beautiful lobby -lrb- and even there , they now have a starbuck !<ssssss>awful -rrb- , i would not bother to visit again .<ssssss>the cheaply do renovation and the overwhelming urge the new owner have to get college kid there , instead of keep the people who have be come for year , like ourselves , and who spend a good amount of money , will be the downfall of this once gorgeous property .<ssssss>the room be definitely in need of renovation , but instead of keep the old world class look of the place , they opt to tear out everything , include the great balcony , and make the room cheaply modern w/paper thin wall .<ssssss>poolside now have blare rap music and the beach be absolutely filthy .<ssssss>for the kind of money you will spend here , spend a bit more and stay at the beautiful ritz carlton where you can get some sleep instead of listen to pound bass from the club below -lrb- and we be on the 8th floor ! -rrb-<ssssss>, noisy hallway and every sound above a whisper in the room next to you .<ssssss>if i be go to puerto rico , i want some latin flavor and style ; i do not want to feel like i be in coney island .<ssssss>a real disappointment .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 2 5 1 5		disappointing compare with last year stay i stay here last year and have a great stay and susequently leave a excellent rating .<ssssss>however , my stay in the king george this year be a big disappointment ... .<ssssss>the room be smaller which in itself would not be a issue but housekeeping be terrible ... .<ssssss>we room be only half service each day ... towel be rarely change over the 5 night stay , coffee be never top up in the room and the musty smell in the room be very annoying .<ssssss>the radiator make a loud rattle or hum sound which we be tell be because the heating be on a old steam system ... we do not experience this problem in the room we stay in the year before .<ssssss>in addition to this there must have be a leak from the radiator as the carpet alongside the radiator be saturated and , i can only assume , most likely responsible for the musty smell in the room.the be a few thing about the hotel that help keep up the rating ... 1 -rrb- its location2 -rrb- the staff -lrb- frontdesk and especially draw in the bar -rrb- the hotel , as i state in my previous review of the hotel , be excellent ... .<ssssss>only a block from bart , shopping and other activities.the staff in the hotel be , at all time , friendly and polite .<ssssss>however we best experience be in the hotel bar at night .<ssssss>we spend a lot of time this year in the hotel bar and be entertain each night by draw the barman .<ssssss>we meet draw during we previous stay at the hotel in 2007 and at that time be impress at he ability to relate to each person in the bar .<ssssss>again this year he remember we and could not have be anymore helpful and friendly.another great thing about the frontdesk staff be the facility in place to advise and arrange we daytime tour and taxi 's to the airport .<ssssss>it be these staff in the hotel that make we experience more comfortable consider the unexpected drop in standard of the room compare to we previous stay there.another improvement in the hotel offering be the change to the breakfast menu ... .<ssssss>a self service buffet replace the original overpriced menu .<ssssss>the variety on offer have increase make it more suit to we need .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 5 4 5 -1		location be main selling point the location of this hotel be fantastic and probably worth stay for that reason alone .<ssssss>the price for this location compare well with other in the area.the staff very friendly and efficient i have to say .<ssssss>and the whole hotel be very very clean.on the downside , room be tiny , and i mean tiny .<ssssss>ours be mean to be superior but we spend the whole stay wonder what we get for the extra 10.00 per night .<ssssss>it seem exactly the same as we friend ' standard room !<ssssss>bathroom be spacious however and again , very clean .<ssssss>breakfast be the main problem for we , not the food , that be ok , just the amount of space for so many guest .<ssssss>there be only 10 table for whole hotel and so we have to eat very late -lrb- 10.00 -rrb- on both day due to not have anywhere to sit.this hotel really be no frill .<ssssss>its a good price for somewhere to lay you head right on hand for the k ' u dam etc. i would recommend it with all of that in mind .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 3 4 4 -1		little disappointing after stay at the metropark hotel in causeway bay , the l'hotel be quite disappointing .<ssssss>this be not a 4 * hotel , more a 3 * .<ssssss>it be located opposite the metro station which be good .<ssssss>the reception staff be polite and helpful .<ssssss>we find we room to be extremely cold and be tell that the heat have be switch off , which i find surprising give that it be winter in hong kong .<ssssss>the room be on the small side , but clean and the bathroom be a adequate size and clean .<ssssss>the bed be like a concrete slab and not very comfortable .<ssssss>i would not stay at this hotel again .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 4 5 4 2		beautiful hawaius this hotel be in a a1 location and give that , be very reasonably price give the rate at other beachfront property .<ssssss>we stay in a ocean view room , and its hard to imagine have a bad day when wake to such a spectaular view of waikiki beach .<ssssss>the pro 's for this hotel be definitely the location , the generous room size and the friendly and helpful staff who be always willing to assist .<ssssss>the tiki bar be also a fun place for a late night beverage , give the hotel a wonderful atmosphere in the evening .<ssssss>for the purpose of balance , i have to say that the breakfast at the hotel have be review negatively previously .<ssssss>i have to say that the concept itself be great , to be able to take you breakfast onto the beach .<ssssss>however the quality of the breakfast be a bit lack .<ssssss>the food be not generally hot enough and there be a very limited selection .<ssssss>in addition , the room could do with a bit of a rennovation , they be somewhat date , and the batroom be cramped and have no vanity .<ssssss>all say , we have a excellent stay at this hotel , and i provide the negative purely for constructive criticism , as with a little work , this could be a truely amazing hotel .<ssssss>i would happy return regardless .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 5 3 -1		great location but hotel could be better we stay here for 5 night .<ssssss>the first room we be give be very spacious but the window be so small and far away from the main part of the room that it feel dark and claustrophobic .<ssssss>so we request a change .<ssssss>we be immediately give a smaller room with more light which we accept .<ssssss>the room be very pleasantly furnished with a kitchen area and washer/drier which be very useful .<ssssss>staff be very polite and helpful .<ssssss>however , on we third day we be wake up by a fire alarm at 6.10 am .<ssssss>there be no staff direct guest out of the building or wait outside the building to tell we where to stand or provide we with info .<ssssss>fireman arrive and leave promtly .<ssssss>when re-enter the building we find most of the guest be in the lobby and only 2 member of staff be present and they do not know whether there be a fire in the building or how to switch the alarm off .<ssssss>this continue for a hour .<ssssss>it be a shambles .<ssssss>it turn out that there be not a fire .<ssssss>what if there be a fire ?<ssssss>all hotel should be prepare for a fire emergency and have fire marshall to provide direction , not leave guest wander around the lobby until they have figure out if there be a fire .<ssssss>put this aside , the hotel be in a great location , good value for toronto and the staff be pleasant enough .<ssssss>

4 5 4 4 4 3 4 2		great place i enjoy my stay here although it be not easy to explain .<ssssss>you be in the heart of time square yet it have a upper east side snottiness to it .<ssssss>the front desk be somewhat obnoxious but they be efficient and helpful with specific request .<ssssss>the concierge be fantastic - he recommendation for broadway show be very helpful .<ssssss>the hotel offer a free breakfast but it be a joke - the pastry probably be buy at the supermarket and be generally uninspiring .<ssssss>if you want a free piece of bread and some okay coffee before you go out , perfect - otherwise go elsewhere .<ssssss>the bartender tell I the restaurant be to open in a couple month and i be sure that will help they clean up they horrible breakfast issue.the room be what make this special - a friend recommend this place to I because the room be much bigger than normal for nyc .<ssssss>they be very spacious and comfortable although they be definitely somewhat worn .<ssssss>sort of remind I of a upscale grandmother 's place - comfortable and nice , but a little tired .<ssssss>nevertheless , my wife and i really enjoy it after long day explore the city.the bellman and doorman be fantastic - they be friendly and personable and incredibly helpful .<ssssss>it seem like they immediately know who we be and be able to point my wife in the right direction for she morning coffee run -lrb- she do not like the hotel 's coffee -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all - a great choice in the time square/theater district .<ssssss>i usually stay at the westin when we visit the city and only try this as it be cheaper .<ssssss>i will likely try the michelangelo again .<ssssss>
4 4 4 3 5 4 3 2		pretty nice .<ssssss>the room be clean , modern , and nicely decorate , but be a bit small .<ssssss>we view be not so great , and the room could be a bit noisy , but overall i would recommend the hotel to other .<ssssss>

2 4 5 5 5 1 2 3		good quality hotel - shame about the front desk staff we need a cheap one-night stopover just outside san francisco as we have to drop off a hire car early the next day and transfer to a hotel in the middle of sf for a longer stay.the sheraton be show the cheapest rate on expedia of all the big name airport hotel so this be perfect for we - we only pay around $ 100 .<ssssss>the hotel have just be refurbish and be easy to find right off the 101 .<ssssss>plenty of parking , although you do have to pay $ 18 a night but its the same with all the hotel in this area.the room themselves be lovely - huge bed with fresh , comfy linen and pillow .<ssssss>a enormous flat screen tv set in the wall , refurbish bathroom and nice toiletries from bliss.so the room be not the issue here ... unfortunately it be the front desk staff .<ssssss>i check in and with barely more than a glance i be hand my key .<ssssss>the lady then go straight back to she computer .<ssssss>i pause , hope she would then go on to tell I where the lift be and the usual thing they tell you about when you check into a hotel -lrb- like check out time , breakfast etc -rrb- .<ssssss>but no , i be leave look a little uncomfortable wonder where to go.after a minute of I still stand there a bit awkwardly , she look up and say ` what ? '<ssssss>i say , which way do we need to go and she , still tap on she computer and not look at I , direct I to the lift .<ssssss>i be not very fussy and i have stay in plenty of hotel but i find this whole episode so rude and unfortunately put I off the hotel .<ssssss>the housekeeping staff , by the way , be lovely and always say hello and be quick and efficient when i ring down for some extra milk .<ssssss>it strike I that all the big chain hotel be try to dumb down guest/staff contact - i do not even need to check out as my bill have be slip under my door and my credit card charge .<ssssss>i be only direct to the key drop bucket by the front door - so no thanks for stay , how be you stay or anything like that .<ssssss>on a brighter note , room service be quick and delicious - and a much better option than kincaid and sizzler down the road .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 4 -1 3 -1		neutral ... .<ssssss>as the other reviewer note , the location of this hotel can not be beat - it be fantastic !<ssssss>the hotel itself be nice , but very expensive .<ssssss>the room be clean , the fitness center clean and have good machine , the pool area nice , etc. ... i have a room on the back courtyard , so it be quiet as well .<ssssss>all in all , a good high 3 star experience .<ssssss>here be the thing that would have make it 4-star for I : - better shower pressure and temperature .<ssssss>- a registration desk staff that be actually friendly and do not act like i be bother them.and lastly , i know it be customary in the hotel industry to charge for every single call - however , i feel this be a outdated archaic practice and should be discontinue .<ssssss>the royal sonesta do indeed charge for every single phone call make ...<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 3 3 4 3		if you be go to san francisco ... i should have know from the outset when reservation at first agreed and then refuse to honour this mandarin oriental 's stay two night get one free deal with american express centurion - apparently because the room category which we wish to book be too high .<ssssss>as well document , the hotel occupy the upper level of a tower block .<ssssss>first impression be not good - the lobby be dark and shabby and light year away from other mandarin such as in miami .<ssssss>thing do not improve when we enter we dynasty suite - the room be dark and the layout not at all attractive .<ssssss>whilst the soft furnishings have supposedly recently be upgrade , the decor in the two bathroom be shocking - poor lighting , seventy ' style minus tile in the shower and the shower head height located somewhere around my chest .<ssssss>on we floor at least , the room be lay out in a barbell with approximately six in a cul de sac formation at each end of the hotel .<ssssss>this very quickly become a issue when we become aware of the sound proofing in the suite - there be none .<ssssss>with we bed headboard adjacent to the hallway door , we be consistently bombard by the thud of bedroom door slam close .<ssssss>have just arrive from a transatlantic flight , we be look forward to relax and catch up on some sleep on the first few day of we vacation - forget it .<ssssss>the non-stop din of housekeeping and other guest come and go ensure that we leave shatter after three day of disrupt sleep .<ssssss>the dining room , where we have breakfast , continue to same dark and tired theme perpetuate throughout the property .<ssssss>

2 4 2 4 5 1 2 3		the tiniest room i have ever see when we book this hotel , we have already read review say that the room be really small .<ssssss>however , we could not have imagine how really tiny they be !<ssssss>there be three of we -lrb- my husband , adult daughter and myself -rrb- in a so-called family room , which literally do not have space to put a suitcase flat on the floor -- we have to put they on the bed whenever we need to open they .<ssssss>there be not a single shelf or cupboard -- and just enough room to walk around the 3 bed !!<ssssss>the bathroom be about 3 ' x 3 ' big -- but i must say that it somehow fit in a toilet , shower and basin -- and there be plenty of hot water.my main gripe , however , be that we be travel with my other daughter and she small and fretful baby -- and the management keep we sit in the lobby for four hour and would not allow we to check in even a little earlier than the fixed time !!<ssssss>to be fair -- the room and bath be sparkling clean , and when the ac conk out late one night , we be immediately move to another -lrb- equally tiny ! -rrb-<ssssss>room .<ssssss>and the hotel be very centrally located .<ssssss>
4 4 3 4 4 5 5 2		hate the bathroom !<ssssss>we just get back from a 1-week stay at the hyatt at fisherman 's wharf ... and i have mix review .<ssssss>staff : the hotel staff be all extremely friendly and helpful - very customer service orientate and each person we speak to go out of they way to be polite and personable.rooms : we hotel room be ... a little disappointing .<ssssss>everything be nice and clean and comfortable , but the bathroom be awful !<ssssss>the door do not shut properly , there be no fan in the bathroom so it would get extremely fog up .<ssssss>and the shower be ... fancy look but not practical .<ssssss>at all.knuckles : the bar/restaurant next door be great !<ssssss>i highly recommend visit this establishment whether you stay at the hyatt or not - excellent food and even better service : the bar staff be funny , friendly and very welcoming!over all , i would recommend this hotel , but probably would not stay there again and i be disappoint in the bathroom !<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 3 2 1 2		barely edible my husband and i have stay at other lead hotel of the world and be excite to have another wonderful experience .<ssssss>the paradisus palma real be a gorgeous resort where no expense seem to have be spare on the decor and the beautiful grounds .<ssssss>however , the main flaw of the resort be in its commitment to serve its guest and to provide food that match with the level of hotel you believe you be stay at .<ssssss>we book a regular garden view suite and due to this could not get a dinner reservation other than a 9:45 pm time slot .<ssssss>apparently the royal service guest get top priority for dinner time .<ssssss>we try on a couple of occasion to show up for dinner a little earlier and see if any table be available and even though we be the only guest wait and multiple table be not in use they make we wait at the bar until we 9:45 pm reservation time .<ssssss>the worker at this resort could really care less about the guest and make they happy or provide a enjoyable experience .<ssssss>i do not consider myself to be a picky eater but do want my food to be fresh and serve at the appropriate temperature and this be definitely not happen .<ssssss>the buffet style restaurant have fly all over the food , they serve green tomato slice and white watermelon , the nacho cheese be keep in a chafer but be cold and the hamburger be not grilled up to order but cook ahead of time and keep in a chafer as well so they be dry and barely warm.this food would be acceptable for a hospital cafeteria but not a high end resort so this be very disappointing and for the price of this resort it do not make any sense .<ssssss>i will not recommend that anyone i know go to this resort unless they pack lot of snack and just plan to drink they vacation away .<ssssss>

4 4 4 3 5 1 2 -1		very nice hotel we love so much about this hotel : nice room , great rainshower , water and apple , pleasant staff .<ssssss>and the restaurant be so good , we eat there two night after sightseeing all day , especially nice to have somewhere so close to go to when you be exhaust .<ssssss>but i have to say , check in be not fun .<ssssss>we get a new , inexperienced person who do not quite know what he be do .<ssssss>he have no idea where the parking be located , could not find the card and no one else in the place seem to know either .<ssssss>so my husband have to park the car on the street , could not find anything and finally after he manage to find a space , he lose he way back .<ssssss>i be wait and worry for a half hour .<ssssss>not something you want to endure when you be check in at 9pm .<ssssss>i can forgive a inexperienced person , but the staff person who correspond with I by email while book the room be just plain inept .<ssssss>i specifically ask in advance about parking and be tell that it be available , i just have to ask when i get there .<ssssss>he mention nothing about a charge , so i figure this mean they have they own parking and it be free .<ssssss>not true .<ssssss>the real situation be that they have a affiliation with a parking garage nearby that charge 17.50 eur a day .<ssssss>or , if that be full , there be another across the street that charge 20 eur a day .<ssssss>if i have know this ahead of time , i may have find a hotel with better parking , but since he do not tell I , i end up tack on 52 eur to my bill .<ssssss>how hard be it to tell guest about parking ?<ssssss>staff answer the reservation request need to brush up on the basic knowledge of the facility of the hotel .<ssssss>
3 -1 4 3 4 1 1 3		place be beautiful ... but not the people after read all the good view , i happily book my reservation through a website , asiarooms.com , and my booking be confirm .<ssssss>but when we arrive , we be tell by the staff that resort be fully book , and that they only have room on the next day .<ssssss>you can imagine the frustration after travel 1.5 hour from nusa-dua to be tell that my confirmation be late , although the booking be already confirm by asiarooms.com .<ssssss>we be also tell that the fault be not of the management and we be tell to take another resort that be not to we liking .<ssssss>and the nerve of the sale rep to reply we in a rude manner that if we do not wish to take the alternative resort room that be obviously worse off , we can sleep on the reception couch !!!<ssssss>i be a frequent traveller and never once have i experience such uprofessional and appaling behaviour from any resort staff .<ssssss>all the greeting and smile be routinely practice , but once there be a predicament like this , the ugly head rear out , and the true color show itself .<ssssss>but luckily for we , the resort owner ari , a plesant woman in every way help to save we honeymoon from a step to be disasterous .<ssssss>she be able to accomodate we in a villa on another resort be just splendid .<ssssss>overall the tepi-sawah resort be in everyway as describe by many review minus the service .<ssssss>thanks arus for save my day .<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 4 -1 5 -1		very good choice for la stay with a tv crew at the magic castle , and although i suffer many joke about want to stay at a hotel with such a odd name it turn out to be a great spot .<ssssss>la be tough for hotel - so much of the city be not a city , at least by non-la standard - it be hard to find a place where you can actually walk to a store or restaurant .<ssssss>the magic castle - which seem off of a set for a tv show or film - be well located , friendly -lrb- in the best sense of the word -rrb- and comfortable .<ssssss>if you get a suite it be really a one bedroom apartment - some of the small room , however , can be quite small .<ssssss>rate vary accord to season - but most of the year it be quite affordable .<ssssss>there be no elevator - which would have be a problem except that the staff lend a hand and even with a lot of metal box we be okay.jon - montreal , quebec<ssssss>
3 3 5 2 5 4 4 -1		very nice hotel we arrive at the parc 55 hotel after a long drive from lo angele .<ssssss>check in be fast and efficient and as we walk into the main lobby we be suprise at how grand it looked.the room be lovely and spacious with two large queen bed .<ssssss>we have we towel change every day and the place and room spotless.the location of the hotel be great as it be only a couple of block away from union square .<ssssss>the cable car stop be only a few block away too and within walk distance.while you be stay in san fran , you must go to alcatraz , it be actually the best thing about san francisco .<ssssss>we manage to see the whole city in two full day , but that be not do at a leisurely pace !<ssssss>also , the golden gate bridge be spectacular and longbard street be cool too .<ssssss>visit pier 39 to see the sea lion and look round the shop and attraction .<ssssss>the only thing i do not like about san fran be the amount of homeless people on the street .<ssssss>I and my friend want to go out for a bite to eat one evening and no sooner have we leave the hotel and walk a couple block , we be harrass by homeless people .<ssssss>i be usually confident in large city like this , i have be to many place , but i have to say that in san fran i feel very uneasy .<ssssss>we end up get a subway sandwich and eat it in the hotel room !!<ssssss>this be a shame as we would have love to have sample the food in china town etc but as two young woman , we do not feel safe at all.the hotel be lovely though and if they could pick it up and put it in another location it would be ideal .<ssssss>if i decide to go back to san fran -lrb- which i do not think i ever will , but never say never -rrb- i would not stay here as a loan female or small group of woman .<ssssss>the only way i would feel safe be if i go with my partner or in a large party .<ssssss>
4 4 2 4 4 4 3 1		great honeymoon resort ... but this be we first time to the excellence .<ssssss>great honeymoon destination , landscaping on the resort be breathtaking .<ssssss>overall the grounds include the pool be very well maintain .<ssssss>great restaurant !<ssssss>we favorite be agave spice for dinner and we thoroughly enjoy the daily breakfast buffet at tuscana .<ssssss>the service at the resort bar and restaurant be great as well .<ssssss>there be even a daily beach bbq which we really enjoy !<ssssss>they cook something different for lunch each day right on the beach .<ssssss>pizza be also hand out on the beach and at the pool during certain time of the day .<ssssss>one day they even bring out fruit kabob while we be lay on the beach .<ssssss>the show be also good .<ssssss>we do not think we would be into go to the show , but the few we go to be great .<ssssss>they bring you a schedule of the show and activity to you room each day so you can decide ahead of time if there be a show you would be interested in see .<ssssss>plan ahead though because if you get there too late the seating be all take .<ssssss>the include horseback ride be really nice although we do not recommend the atv tour the resort offer for $ 80 .<ssssss>basically they take you to the outskirts of punta cana , which be very underdeveloped and the dirt road be extremely bumpy !<ssssss>there be no reason to leave the resort on you own .<ssssss>from what we could tell , there be not much outside the resort and if you do not know you way around it have the potential to be shady .<ssssss>we also must say that the room need attention .<ssssss>at least ours do .<ssssss>upon enter we be greet with a very musty smell and many of the room amenity need update .<ssssss>the jacuzzi tub take 45 minute to fill up and the refrigerator keep thing cool at best .<ssssss>the service to the room could have be improve on as well .<ssssss>we door would not lock at one point and they leave we wait a hour before someone come to fix it .<ssssss>also , one night we have ant and it take a hour for someone to bring we bug spray .<ssssss>the room service take at least a hour each time you order and you get the feeling you be bother they when you do place a order .<ssssss>we mini bar be fill once in the week we be there , and should have be fill daily .<ssssss>luckily , you do not spend much time at all in you room , and once you leave you room you be welcome by paradise so it do not matter as much .<ssssss>overall , great experience .<ssssss>we would consider stay at a excellence resort again .<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 4 5 4 1		average and expensive i spend two night at the hilton in the boston financial district .<ssssss>it definitely have it be good point and bad point .<ssssss>the entire staff be very polite and helpful .<ssssss>the hotel be in a great location , and my coworker and i be able to walk to dinner and shopping nearby .<ssssss>my room have a beautiful comfortable bed , but ... my room be on the 4th floor directly above a giant air conditioning unit on a lower roof of the hotel .<ssssss>the unit hum all night and i regret not pack a sleep aid !<ssssss>i ask about use a business center to print out my board pass .<ssssss>the business center -lrb- 2 computer and 1 printer -rrb- charge a minimum of $ 10 to get online .<ssssss>if a patron be pay $ 349 per night , be able to use a business center to print out a board pass and check flight status should be free and not at a additional charge .<ssssss>i also find the hotel a bit dark because of the decor -lrb- mustard yellow green pattern carpeting -rrb- .<ssssss>overall , it be adequate lodging for a business trip , but i have stay in better for less .<ssssss>
3 2 3 2 3 4 4 4		just ok ... definitely not a 4 star we choose the ayre after read the review on tripadvisor and arrive there for a 4-night stay with rather high expectations.the first disappointment come with the location of the hotel : it be not that close to a metro station -lrb- 15 min .<ssssss>walk to arc de triumf -rrb- and quite far from any major tourist attraction -lrb- closest would be the familia sagrada at 30 min .<ssssss>walk -rrb- .<ssssss>there be nothing really of interest in the neighborhood and i be still wonder why they choose that place to build a hotel as it suit neither a business trip need or a holiday break expectation ... the staff be polite and speak several foreign language -lrb- english , french ... -rrb- .<ssssss>room be large and clean , but the overall hotel interior design remind I more of a ikea showroom : the furniture be actually make of cheap material and feel cold .<ssssss>we have a room on the street side : it be quite noisy at night.i have stay in seveal 4 / 5 star hotel , and the ayre should be classify as a 3-star .<ssssss>breakfast be just ok , although i would also recommend to go for one of the coffe shop nearby.not actually a bad place , but there be many other better place to stay in barcelona whether you be there for business or for a vacation .<ssssss>this hotel be probably overrate on tripadvisor , check for other reviews/hotels as a stay in barcelona deserve a accomodation as exciting as the city can be !<ssssss>

2 2 3 2 3 3 1 4		warning - dont book here if you want privacy , sea view or good service !<ssssss>i pay to stay at four season hotel for one reason only - that i wont be disappoint .<ssssss>sadly that exactly what i be with jimbaran bay four season - bitterly disappointed .<ssssss>much of this i put down to the four season website which state each villa have a private garden with infinity view of the ocean , well villa 150 possess neither of those quality .<ssssss>we pool and garden be so open that when ever we be sit in it try to do a discreet spot of topless bathing every member of staff that go past beneath wave and attempt to strike up a conversation - a long way from be private .<ssssss>as for those ocean view , well they be non existent , the only view we have be of the bungalow in front - not quite the image the website would have you conjure up .<ssssss>in all the villa be ok but certainly nothing special that you expect of the four season .<ssssss>in fact the layout have not really be think through properly , a couple of gripe : 1 -rrb- there be no separate door on the toilet , so you have to shut the whole bathroom and dress area off if you want to go to the loo in private .2 -rrb- the mini bar be located in the outside living area , so every morning i have to traipse across in my nightie to get a drink , invariably to the call of good morning from the staff below who i be on full view to.plus in the evening have to go in and out give the mosquito 's more of a opportunity to get in , which be probably why there be a filthy , musty smell mosquito net place over my bed every night .<ssssss>it be so disgusting that every night my husband and i have to tie it back up as it make we cringe.however what really upset myself and my husband be the treatment we receive from the security staff every time we go through front gate .<ssssss>grant as we have hire a motorbike -lrb- one of we little pleasure when we be on holiday , as despite want to stay in luxury we also like to immerse ourselves in the local sight and life -rrb- we be not a typical four season guest and for the first couple day we let it ride each time we be abruptly stop each time we try to go through the front gate and interrogate with the scream of you guest here ?<ssssss>we even joke about it to begin with .<ssssss>however it quickly get wear , be scream at and stop like a common criminal two or three time a day .<ssssss>in fact throughout the whole of we ten day stay , there be only the one occasion that we actually get through the font gate without be stop and interrogate .<ssssss>i have never receive this treatment at any other f .<ssssss>at the end of we stay we fly to singapore and stay in the ritz carlton where amazingly we be greet by we name within minute of stay there .<ssssss>now that be the sort of service i expect!would i stay here again ?<ssssss>do not get I wrong , it be alright , my holiday be not ruin , but it be not what i book or what i be under the impression i be pay for .<ssssss>it be a shame because until now i could always bank on a fs hotel .<ssssss>i will definitely be go back to balus , as it be stunning - but i just wont be return here .<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 5 2 5 4		great hotel , but no amsterdam atmosphere generally this be a excellent hotel , but not suitable for tourist who want to experience the city and late night ; however , great for stop over or business .<ssssss>a shuttle service take guest back and forth to the hotel during the day - the journey be approx .<ssssss>10 min .<ssssss>from the airport you can then catch a train into a ` dam centre which take around 30 min .<ssssss>all-in-all i would allow one hour from leave you room to reach central a ` dam .<ssssss>the hotel be situate in a business/office park on the edge of the airport so there be no amenity outside the hotel , nor nowhere to walk.i stay in a standard room , which be very well furnished and clean , but i would have find it a bit small for two people .<ssssss>i be somewhat concerned about the feather bed and wake up with a allergic reaction - but they be very comfy .<ssssss>there be two restaurant and a bar -lrb- american style -rrb- ; the bar serve reasonably price food , approx .<ssssss>20 euro for a meal .<ssssss>breakfast be excellent , but 22 euro a pop .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>free wifus be available in the lobby and bar area , but no wifus in standard room !<ssssss>the tv have a good variety of channel , a on-demand movie service .<ssssss>-lrb- parent beware of the adult channel - they be not completely lock and can be preview . -rrb-<ssssss>my only criticism of service be the check out procedure - this take 20 min of wait around , then deal with a trainee , then deal with someone else , during which time i be become increasingly nervous about miss my flight .<ssssss>also the lobby be on many occasion swamp with people meet for business workshop etc. .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 1 3 3 1		the park hotel - well , we get to laugh a lot !<ssssss>oh , the park hotel , what memory you have give we .<ssssss>this be not we first , second , third , fourth , fifth , etc. choice .<ssssss>but we choose to go to amsterdam during the international broadcast conference , and really , it be nearly impossible to find a room .<ssssss>because of the conference , the price be ludicrous .<ssssss>the first night be about $ 500 , with each successive night a little less expensive.the art deco lobby be cool , and you think , wow , this might be neat .<ssssss>then you hear the direction to you room .<ssssss>you literally turn the corner and leave the art deco behind and arrive in a dinghy , scary hallway .<ssssss>then the elevator be pretty much a old freight elevator convert for guest .<ssssss>then it be another flight of stair up to the fifth floor where we room was.upon enter the hallway , the first thing i notice be the smell .<ssssss>to I , it be like stale trash linger in the hallway .<ssssss>it never go away.the room be ... interesting .<ssssss>the bed be amazingly comfortable , and it have funky lighting so you could sleep in you own private red light district , or blue light , or yellow , or green , or white .<ssssss>you get the idea .<ssssss>the bathroom area be cramped , and the shower -- yes , it be exactly as everyone say ... flood , flood , flood .<ssssss>we try everything , but the most we get be ... less flooding.we have a room overlook the road , so it be very noisy .<ssssss>and , it just do not feel clean , i want to walk through the room with a antibacterial wipe , and believe it or not , i be decidedly not a germaphobe.the location be extraordinary ... you can not fault that , and if you do not mind the smell , the shower , etc. this be a good place .<ssssss>it be kind of funky .<ssssss>but weirdly , this be we last stop on we european honeymoon , and this be the only place we meet rude staff .<ssssss>but we laugh it off , thing like , you can only get the full breakfast buffet in momo , you can not get just a coffee , well , you can , but they will only serve it to you in the lobby .<ssssss>but do i mention the bed be super comfy ?<ssssss>i can not say this place be horrible , only that we would never stay here again .<ssssss>but it be kind of funny .<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		nightmare in derby i be a farily objective person , but i miss the boat when book we 5 night stay in florence base on review from other .<ssssss>maybe i be spoil , but i tend to think that a person should not have to feel sick each and every time they walk into they room !<ssssss>i be not say that the room be filthy , but there be a distanct odor that i have never smell before .<ssssss>it hit I every time we come back from we daily activity .<ssssss>the maid turn the air-conditioning off whenever they clean which make the smell even worse .<ssssss>the lift be a very small opening and be suppose to be non-smoking .<ssssss>every time we use it there be smoke so bad , you smell the rest of the day .<ssssss>we travel italy for 15 day and this be the worst hotel we deal with .<ssssss>the desk clerk be very helpful , but other than that , we stay be horrific .<ssssss>we will do better next tme .<ssssss>florence be a nice city .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 5 2 2 -1		nice place , pity about the air conditioning really great location , on top of the metro station , short walk to rue cler , etc. we discount rate room be nice with big window , plenty of space , storage , desk and outlet for charge everything .<ssssss>bathroom be plenty big as well and beautifully clean.the problem be not huge but they be sufficiently annoying that i would think twice about stay here again .<ssssss>first , the a/c control do not work .<ssssss>we be very kindly give a demonstration of how to work the control but the room do not cool down if we leave the window shut .<ssssss>we speak to the front desk several time about this but the situation be never resolve .<ssssss>also , housekeeping be stingy when it come to soap , shampoo etc. for a four star hotel and for the rate we pay , i should not have to make a note to myself to ask for more soap and shampoo after the second day of a four day stay.for what we pay , we could do better in term of service .<ssssss>not sure if we could do better in term of location .<ssssss>i hope this place improve , it have a lot go for it !<ssssss>
5 5 2 -1 5 -1 5 -1		friendly and cheap do not normally write review but i see that this hotel have get a bit of a slate from some people so think i would better redress the balance.yes the room be small , and yes the stair be steep ... but it be budget accomodation , in the heart of where you want to be in amsterdam !<ssssss>it be walk distance from the station , two minute from some of the best coffeeshop you be go to find and the staff be very welcome and friendly .<ssssss>what more do you want ???<ssssss>if you be after luxury you pay 5 time as much and go elsewhere ... there be no pretence at hotel brian , they offer cheap and clean accomodation for people who want a affordable trip to amsterdam.the guy run it when we be there keep we happily entertain by just be he - open , down to earth and with a pythonesque kind of humour ... and very helpful.well recommend to anyone who be not too whiney !<ssssss>- have fun !<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 2 2 3		completely unacceptable i book with this hotel because of the rate compare with other hotel in the area .<ssssss>the old adage you get what you pay for describe this hotel to a tee.i be write this review as i * do not * sleep at hotel 140 .<ssssss>why do not i sleep ?<ssssss>well , for one , about once a hour i get treat to some unexplainable noise , roughly akin to a sledgehammer hit a shotgun shell .<ssssss>then , with about the same amount of frequency , i be treat to the groaning of pipes.there be some other thing about this hotel , in addition to unexplained and loud noise , that cause I to seriously warn folk about stay here : first , there be no interior lock on my door .<ssssss>that be right , no way for I to lock my door from the inside .<ssssss>anyone with a master key could walk right in .<ssssss>i could have swear that be a legal requirement .<ssssss>secondly , when i turn down my sheet , i find two neatly place hair ... neither of which be my own .<ssssss>i honestly believe that these sheet be not change .<ssssss>at the very least , those change the sheet be not be very sanitary.finally , the term boutique be really a deception .<ssssss>it be not try to define the hotel as quaint ... it be a warning term that these room be very , very small .<ssssss>you want a desk to work at ?<ssssss>forget about it .<ssssss>a closet for you clothes ?<ssssss>not at this hotel.ok .<ssssss>you have be warn .<ssssss>if you book inspite of all this , best of luck to you .<ssssss>

3 3 4 2 5 3 -1 4		keep the window shut this be a very nice hotel in what appear to be a residential suburb of barcelona .<ssssss>the room be reasonably size with a tv , mini-bar , electronic safe and a nice en-suite bathroom .<ssssss>the decor would not be to my taste but that be a minor quibble .<ssssss>however , if you be think of stay here , bear in mind that it be located right beside a busy motorway which be never quiet .<ssssss>make sure to keep you window shut at night if you want a good night 's sleep !<ssssss>also , it be quite far out from the center of the city so you will be spend a lot of time on bus and the subway .<ssssss>it be right beside the mundet metro station -lrb- l3 -rrb- and take about 15 minute to get to catalunya square.if you want to stay in a relatively cheap , nice hotel , i would recommend this one .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 3 5 4 3		great little hotel !<ssssss>my wife and i stay here for 4 night in march .<ssssss>yes , the decor be a little floral to say the least !<ssssss>that be the only negative though.for the money , in a superb location with a great view , what more can you ask for?the all day buffet be great , really nice to come in at 2 am .<ssssss>and get a glass of juice and a coffee before bed .<ssssss>-lrb- which be very comfortable as well -rrb- friendly staff , it be great be able to sit on the veranda look down at the rambla in the late afternoon sun too.i certainly will not be look further than this hotel when we return to barcelona , we love it !<ssssss>

5 4 5 5 5 5 5 2		beautiful resort , fantastic service and a memorable trip the punta cana area be mostly know for huge all-inclusive resort , but fortunately the agua resort , a botique spa hotel , have arrive in the beautiful uvero alto region .<ssssss>what a find this place was!arrival at the punta cana airport can be confuse with local hustle for you luggage and the large group from apple vacation and the like be hoard onto they bus like cattle .<ssssss>it be a pleasure to see a man standing right outside of baggage claim with we name on a sign and a big smile , ready to take we bag into a private air-conditioned van for the ride to the resort .<ssssss>agua be about a hour away from the airport , and although some of the road be not well paved and it can seem as there be no actual traffic law on this island , the trip be not a problem at all - nothing like the horrendously nauseating drive from montego bay to negril .<ssssss>the last stretch be on a entirely unpaved road which lead to very large and non-descript door , but as soon as they be open - wow !<ssssss>the beautiful outdoor lobby open up to what appear to be a incredible oasis in the middle of nowhere .<ssssss>drink and cold towel be bring over and as seem to be the pattern throughout the week , the staff be extremely attentive and courteous .<ssssss>make no mistake - this hotel be small -lrb- just fifty-one room -rrb- so if you be look for a mega-resort with non-stop activity it be probably not for you .<ssssss>that be say , it be one of the most beautiful place that either of we have ever stay .<ssssss>the room be simply elegant - not fancy but incredibly warm and soothing .<ssssss>the floor , lamp , bathroom area and everything else be design with a great attention to the relaxing esthetic .<ssssss>so be all of the public area .<ssssss>i highly recommend check out the picture on the website and then imagine the actual resort be even more beautiful in person .<ssssss>we room be on the first of two level and right on the beach .<ssssss>now this be not simply a ocean-view or beach-front room ; it be actually right on the beach .<ssssss>large slide glass door open to a patio with a table and two huge lounge chair which be actually connect to the sand .<ssssss>the view be incredible and it be so nice just to open you door and be right on the beach .<ssssss>the sand be a fine golden color and the water nice and blue ; just the typical perfect beach that the punta cana area be know for -lrb- although the sand be not the pure white of some of the other beach -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all , this be the perfect setting to enjoy five day of pure relaxation , excellent food , great service , long walk on the beach and lot of lounge around .<ssssss>after read some of the review on trip advisor , i actually start get cold foot and almost cancel this hotel and thought of move down the beach to excellence .<ssssss>what a bad move that would have be .<ssssss>with that in mind , i would like to address some of the concern that i have while read these other postings.no doubt the hotel be new and be experience some growing pain .<ssssss>some thing just do not work and apparently repair in the dominican be none too swift .<ssssss>thankfully , the excellent management make up for any problem quickly.two example - upon we arrival the main pool be not functional , so we be upgrade to that fantastic room right on the beach .<ssssss>i do not know why anyone would want to use the pool anyway with that beautiful beach right there , but it do look pretty cool.the wireless internet be not work correctly in we room , and since it look like repair be a long way off , they give we a key to a vacant room which have a strong wireless signal .<ssssss>so problem solve , and who want to spend all day on the internet anyway when on vacation ?<ssssss>also , the business center have a free computer with internet that be always vacant .<ssssss>so no problem there.as far as the food , they must have get a new chef or maybe threaten the old one , because the food be plentiful and delicious .<ssssss>we only comment on the food quality be that we would have enjoy a few more simple dish such as plain grilled fish in the mediterannean style .<ssssss>this stuff be a little heavy at time -lrb- although they can prepare it any way that you like -rrb- .<ssssss>that be say , although the menu be small , every night they have dinner special which be quite good .<ssssss>definitely ask about the dominican dinner , which if you do not mind eat goat be not to be miss .<ssssss>many seem to comment on the cost of the food .<ssssss>no question , this be not a all inclusive and they do not charge denny 's price , but then again it be a high-end resort spa .<ssssss>if you want pile and pile of mediocre food and long line perhaps a all-inclusive be for you .<ssssss>even so , the price be much lower than what you would expect at a four season or ruth 's chris .<ssssss>the big disadvantage be that it be pretty tough to get a inexpensive light dinner if that be what you be craving .<ssssss>but the great thing be that they always throw in some little special someting that you do not order , so the value always turn out well .<ssssss>a example would be delicious lobster bisque in a large shot glass top with a snail that come with dinner one night .<ssssss>yum !<ssssss>also , one of we be celebrate a birthday and they be extremely generous with goody that night .<ssssss>along with the food , the food service be superb .<ssssss>definitely order lunch at the beach grill and have it bring over to you beach chair .<ssssss>what a experience !<ssssss>we order club sandwhich , and they just go wild .<ssssss>first come ice bucket for we beer , then nacho and guac one day , fresh fruit the next , tropical punch the next ; all complimentary .<ssssss>we even ask if they have fresh coconut and ten minute later it show up beautifully slice and delicious .<ssssss>keep in mind , this be all at no charge .<ssssss>so while the price may be a bit high-end , all the goody come along with it .<ssssss>another typical complaint be that not much english be speak .<ssssss>well , duh !<ssssss>it be a spanish speaking country !<ssssss>the world do not revolve around american .<ssssss>even so , take a few minute to make a attempt at spanish and you will be treat extremely well .<ssssss>there be enough english speak staff that communication be really not a problem .<ssssss>we really enjoy take long beach walk every day .<ssssss>this be a perfect beach for a long walk with fine sand and warm gentle water .<ssssss>walk to you right when face the ocean and you can go for quite a while .<ssssss>plus , eventually you will pass the excellence resort with its military bunker styling and be glad that you do not stay there .<ssssss>right next to the excellence there be a small string of shop that be good for souvenir , island jewelery , cigar , etc. if you ask , they will even bring you back a cold six-pack of the great local beer , presidente .<ssssss>-lrb- oh - here be a tip .<ssssss>if you leave a few dollar and a note for the evening housekeeper , she will stock you up with water and a few bottle of beer which magically do not show up on we bill ! -rrb-<ssssss>the spa at agua be just right - nice atmosphere for massage and a really interesting circuit pool with all kind of neat thing like a hot tub , cool slab with water jet , a waterfall , water massager , a mist shower , etc. very fun to hang out there .<ssssss>to wrap it up , if you be look for a mega-resort with beach volleyball , water aerobic , obnoxious music blast on the beach and gob of free food and alcohol , the agua be not for you .<ssssss>but of you want a incredibly indulgent vacation , relish in the fact that there be not much to do except relax among incredible architecture with fantastic service , this may be you hotel .<ssssss>no question they be still work out a few kink , but it do not seem to matter at all .<ssssss>the service always make up for the few problem we encounter .<ssssss>they try very hard to get everything right , and definitely succeed .<ssssss>we will be back !<ssssss>

3 4 2 5 4 4 5 -1		nice , but not up to four season standard we stay recently for a couple of night on a bed and breakfast package .<ssssss>the positive : great location , the staff be very nice and very friendly to we two year old son , the king size bed in we room be excellent .<ssssss>the negative : the room size be give on they website as 375 sq. foot .<ssssss>there be no way we room be that size , unless they count the bathroom , the closet and part of the outside hallway .<ssssss>the room , while not small , be by no means spacious .<ssssss>the towel we receive both day be barely good enough for a holiday inn .<ssssss>they be very old and need to be replace .<ssssss>one time we even get a towel with yellow stain on it - it be promptly replace by housekeeping with a clean -lrb- although similarly old -rrb- towel , but this be not something that should happen at a four season hotel .<ssssss>we breakfast be suppose to be include in the room rate , but we be actually charge extra for we breakfast on sunday .<ssssss>this be because breakfast include actually mean a certain dollar amount that 2 guest can spend on breakfast , and the sunday brunch for 2 people -lrb- which be the only option for breaksfast on sunday , there be no a la carte -rrb- come to more than that amount .<ssssss>this , of course , be not disclose on they website when you book .<ssssss>we do receive a refund of the extra amount we be charge for breakfast after we complain , but complain be not what one want to do on vacation and certainly not at a four season .<ssssss>overall , this be not a excellent hotel and we probably will stay elsewhere on we next visit to boston .<ssssss>

4 2 5 3 5 5 5 -1		very , very stylish .<ssssss>but you do pay for it.if value-for-money be important to you , then you should not be look at this hotel.we stay in a club level room , and it be sumptuous .<ssssss>we have stay in some nice place over the year and i do not ever recall my wife look so impressed at the standard of the room as she do here.the bed be so comfortable.the bathroom be very smart , dual sink in the middle - one side have a separate room for the toilet and bidet , and a separate wet room for the shower .<ssssss>the other side have a recess with the bath in it .<ssssss>my wife now want the same arrangement at home ... stay at the club level give you access to the club lounge .<ssssss>they have five different buffet spread on per day , nothing substantial , but enough so that you do not need to eat elsewhere if you do not want to .<ssssss>plus there seem to be a endless supply of champagne.the service in the club lounge be very attentive , but not intrusive.it be unfortunate that we be in barcelona for the heaviest rain that they have ever know , and the hotel be not gear up for it .<ssssss>water be leak into the club lounge .<ssssss>as a result of the leak into other part of the hotel they have to turn the water to the room off for most of saturday afternoon / evening while repair be conduct .<ssssss>this be incredibly inconvenient if you be there at the time but i doubt that that be a regular occurrence.the location be a bit far from the centre of town , it be at the very boundary of walkable , and that be only if you have a lot of energy .<ssssss>there be a metro station nearby though , and the concierge at the entrance have a button for summon taxis.as for the noise , we be on the 30th floor and from there we could hear the siren of emergency vehicle , and the whistle of the policeman direct traffic outside , but not too much else.in summary , i would only recommend this place if you want to spend a load of money on a treat.you can expect to see some celebrity while you be there too .<ssssss>
5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5		excellent hotel ... not centrally located .<ssssss>-- at all !<ssssss>excellent hotel !<ssssss>very quiet section of the city .<ssssss>3 adult stay in one room .<ssssss>the room be large and clean .<ssssss>the bathroom be huge also .<ssssss>the only downside be that this hotel be not centrally located .<ssssss>we live in nyc and walk everywhere and feel the hotel be not near any of the attraction .<ssssss>be prepare to take the metro and or a taxi everywhere !<ssssss>the fountain -lrb- at night -rrb- be near the hotel and this be one attraction that be within a walk distance .<ssssss>

1 1 4 -1 2 -1 2 -1		lot of problem - stay away where do i start ?<ssssss>first , if you be even consider a vacation here , be warn to go elsewhere .<ssssss>this place be not what you travel agent may tell you .<ssssss>it be not nearly finish and should never have open to the public - bad management .<ssssss>there be many safety hazard due to the fact that it be still undergo construction - loose wire , rock and dirt pile , etc. aside from that , it lack many basic service and amenity , much less anything approach the 5-star quality that it be suppose to be.check inwe pre-booked and prepaid for everything .<ssssss>when we arrive , they do not have any room for we at all .<ssssss>the hotel staff and management do nothing to assist we and be totally unresponsive to we query or concern -lrb- or offer tip -rrb- that we have a 3-year old child , nothing to eat , and nowhere to sleep .<ssssss>we see and talk to many other people in the lobby who be stick there for hour with no room , either .<ssssss>the resort be literally build the room and move in the furniture as we wait , but even that could not make up for all the guest wait for room .<ssssss>we finally have to go to a different resort for that first night , which we ourselves have to arrange since the entire staff be overworked , have many other people yell at they , and be completely incapable of do anything to help .<ssssss>luckily we be able to find another resort with a room available for one night .<ssssss>the next day we finally get a room back at majestic colonial .<ssssss>too bad.foodtotally sub-par .<ssssss>not 5-star .<ssssss>mostly buffet .<ssssss>house wine awful .<ssssss>even the choice of menu wine that you have to pay for be bad - nothing for a serious -lrb- or even casual -rrb- wine-drinker to enjoy .<ssssss>bar service be chaotic at best .<ssssss>the entire staff be so obviously untrained - they literally walk back and forth do nothing with daze look on they face ; if what you ask of they be too much -lrb- like order a drink -rrb- , sometimes they will outright ignore you and walk away .<ssssss>finally we find one server who be decent and just try to seek she out whenever we want something .<ssssss>the a la carte restaraunt be okay , but not great .<ssssss>there be time of the day when there be no food available , which be unfortunate if you do not like to rush or have a timetable to adhere to , or if you have a child who nap through meal time and then be hungry when nothing be available .<ssssss>we be tell there would be snack , but these turn out to be only hotdog and hamburger at the beach bar - not the healthiest choice.roomsthe room we have be actually nice - poolside with private jacuzzi , which we use every day .<ssssss>the all marble shower and floor be beautiful but treacherously slippery .<ssssss>the room have a few issue - look like it be rush through , and there be a few hole and miss seal in the wall and corner and ceiling ; i suppose that be how mosquito constantly enter the room .<ssssss>also , there be very loud cricket somewhere in the room that chirp constantly all night -lrb- no exaggeration -rrb- , which get a bit annoying .<ssssss>no facecloth , no tissue , no garbage can , no mini bar -lrb- unless you consider a small fridge of bottled water and soda -rrb- , no snack , no shower soap , only tiny circle of hand soap.groundsthe grounds be very nice , but the landscaping need fill in -lrb- the least of you worry , believe I -rrb- .<ssssss>the path be downright dumb - some lead nowhere , and you see guest cut across grass and low shrub to conveniently get to where they be go .<ssssss>also , lighting be lack in many place , make it a bit dangerous in place -lrb- like the bridge that cross the pool -rrb- at nighttime.poolthe pool be the one thing that be gorgeous - a very long , huge , freeform pool .<ssssss>it seem clean enough and we enjoy that .<ssssss>we be a bit worried about a few troublesome filter area that look potentially dangerous to child , but we just stay away from those .<ssssss>the bar by the pool be a bit annoying , as there be always some ` activity ' staff try to get tourist to do thing - play volleyball , limbo , dance , or do other strange tourist trap type activity , and very loud ones.spaspa , although open , be not quite ready , either .<ssssss>i have two appointment , which be botch -lrb- overbooked -rrb- .<ssssss>the massage i get be basic , and the girl be so sick she have to leave the room twice to deal with she cough fit .<ssssss>the shower , steam room and sauna be nice , but again , not quite ready yet.beachbeach be pretty - soft sand , clean water ; see some reef area and lot of fish -lrb- surprising -rrb- .<ssssss>but near the resort there be a lot of construction rock that be just throw there and be now mix with the sand , and also lot of broken glass .<ssssss>the beach chair be comfortable but not enough of they for all the guest .<ssssss>there be catamaran and banana boat and donut -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>and speed boat and kayak available .<ssssss>we do not do any of that , but people who do look like they be have fun .<ssssss>one thing that be annoying be the many helicopter that constantly fly over the resort and buzz quite close to the water and swimmer a few time - i think they be tourist on pleasure ride .<ssssss>we walk down the beach to see some of the other resort .<ssssss>all the same , more or less .<ssssss>lot of people , crowd bar , crowd pools.summarythe entire punta cana strip be basically row after row of all-inclusive mega resort that cater to those who enjoy non-stop drinking and loud music .<ssssss>if that be you taste , you will like it here .<ssssss>if you prefer a quiet , relax vacation , you would be well-advised to consider somewhere else altogether .<ssssss>if you do go to punta cana , stay away from majestic colonial for at least another year - it be simply not ready and not worth the headache of everything that it be struggle with - no matter what discount you travel agent offer .<ssssss>if you be look for 5-star , or any quality vacation , this be not it .<ssssss>
5 4 5 3 5 4 2 5		very nice we stay here with a fastpitch softball team .<ssssss>the hotel be very nice and we love the extra place and we be here for 6 day .<ssssss>the breakfast be good and the overall price be great.only problem be a rule against youth swimming after 10pm .<ssssss>the pool be not right outside anyone 's room and it be summer vacation and very hot .<ssssss>we have just finish a game and the girl want a swim with we adult present .<ssssss>the guard kick the girl -lrb- just 4 of they with two adult -rrb- out of the pool .<ssssss>other than that , we have a great stay .<ssssss>
4 4 2 5 4 5 5 3		very enjoyable be just back from a terrific weekend in amsterdam where we stay 2 night at the nadia hotel .<ssssss>the hotel be very central be perfectly place to allow you to tackle all major sight on foot , which be exactly what you need for a w ` end city break .<ssssss>firstly , i really can not say enough about the staff .<ssssss>they be so pleasant and so helpful and could not do enough for we .<ssssss>secondly , the room be clean functional and be grand for a short break .<ssssss>but they be tiny !!<ssssss>i can not stress that fact enough .<ssssss>fine for a couple , but we have some comical moment nontheless .<ssssss>breakfast be nothing special - great coffee , bread , cheese jam etc. not exactly hearty if a full irish be you thing !<ssssss>the next really remarkable thing about the hotel , be the stair in it .<ssssss>you have to climb a sheer cliff face of stair just to get to the reception .<ssssss>seriously , a rope would not have go astray .<ssssss>you need to have you wit about you go either up or down they and if you be in any way unable for climb / abseil then this be not the hotel for you .<ssssss>overall though its a good spot and a great base for a weekend in amsterdam .<ssssss>enjoy !!<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 3 -1 2 -1		could not care less good location and that be all .<ssssss>during the stay the hotel be undertake major building work - and we be talk here about , for instance , wall be knock down .<ssssss>the service be also curtail , as the hotel be not able to function properly .<ssssss>however the hotel still charge full rates.the suppose new deluxe room be very small in comparison with other hotel in barcelona and the value be therefore very poor despite the location .<ssssss>we find stay in the room both hazardous and unpleasant .<ssssss>the fitting be similar to cheap retail store fitting -lrb- dark wood laminate -rrb- and the dÃ©cor induce feeling of depression .<ssssss>really it be design nonsense of style over practicality .<ssssss>the best part about the room be be able to leave it.complaints to the hotel be meet with arrogant compliancy .<ssssss>they probably think that there be enough new customer not to worry .<ssssss>my advice be to go elsewhere ; you will be much happier .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 3 3		great hotel in the heart of barcelona we just spend a few day in this hotel in barcelona and where really happy with it .<ssssss>the number one bonus of this hotel be its quite location .<ssssss>although in the centre of barcelona right next to the rambla , its located in a pedestrian area with no bar or shop next to it .<ssssss>so there be no noise whatsoever and you can sleep with you window or balcony door open .<ssssss>we have a room on the 6th floor with a little balcony and a view over the roof , which be nice .<ssssss>the room itself be nice with modern furniture , with a good comfortable bed , but a bit small .<ssssss>aircondition working , safe in the room but no coffee make facility .<ssssss>the bathroom be big compare to the room but a little old around the edge .<ssssss>the hotel and room be very clean and staff be friendly enough .<ssssss>all in all , a perfect joice for people who like to stay right in the center but without all the noise .<ssssss>i would definitely stay there again .<ssssss>
1 1 3 2 -1 4 4 1		terrible hotel first for the good : the room and bed be nice .<ssssss>now the rest .<ssssss>parking be far away , valet parking be $ 22 a day , and allow a half hour to get you car in the morning .<ssssss>breakfast be a ripoff , all a la carte and very expensive .<ssssss>i settle for a roll at the starbuck inside the hotel and even that be very expensive , almost five buck for a cup of coffee and a roll .<ssssss>no entertainment at night , not even a piano bar , just this awful techno music play all day and night and the depressing black and white decor .<ssssss>oh , and the high speed interenet .<ssssss>almost $ 11 a day and i get speed that remind I of my old 100 baud modem , when it work .<ssssss>but it usually do not , so i call and get connect to some overseas guy who have to tweak it for I .<ssssss>and i have to do this every day , it never work twice .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 3 -1 5 -1		enjoyable stay the hotel itself i thought be average , but the staff be outstanding , the location be very good and the room be quiet .<ssssss>each night the room around we be full and i rarely hear my neighbor .<ssssss>bed be a bit hard though.one morning we come down for breakfast in the restaurant and the hostess be busy but another hotel employee see we wait to be seat and promptly show we a table and bring we menu even though it clearly be not he job to do so .<ssssss>that be the type of service we receive from all of the staff and it be what make out stay above average.we take the t between the airport and the hotel .<ssssss>on the way in we take the silver line to the south station , transfer to the red line to the charles/mgh station and on the way back to the airport we take the blue line from government centre to the airport station and catch the airport shuttle .<ssssss>either way be quick and efficient and at $ 1.25 you can not go wrong.this hotel have a nice patio on the 2nd floor with a outdoor pool and a guest laundry room with a couple of coin-operated washer and dryer .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 5 5 5 3		great location the location of this hotel be excellent .<ssssss>the people be all very nice .<ssssss>expedia book it as a condo -- it be definitely only a hotel room .<ssssss>have two full size bed in one small room -- bathroom also very small -- but sufficient .<ssssss>you should buy you own coffee -- they give you one pot 's worth , after that it be $ 1.00 per filter pack .<ssssss>kona coffee be very reasonably price anywhere you go on the island .<ssssss>four adult stay here for 8 day and we make it work , no problem , but there be no privacy .<ssssss>but it be very well keep up , housekeeping daily if you want it , and the staff be great .<ssssss>lot of restaurant , shopping , beach , all very near -- we walk or take the bus everywhere we go .<ssssss>there be a place on kuhio a couple of block call blue water seafood co. that be a trailer in a parking lot and it have the very best food .<ssssss>around the cocrner be seaside grill -- $ 2.99 for two egg , 2 bacon , 2 pancake .<ssssss>but watch out when you order drink , they will double you bill .<ssssss>drink coffee in you room , then go get breakfast with water .<ssssss>

horrible , steakhouse be okay , buffet - avoid .<ssssss>i have the jerk chicken at le gourmet and it be pretty good so we decide to book there again , but we have a 7:30 be excursion the next day so we ask the girl at the restaurant if we could come back on friday and she say she would get we in , and when we come back two day later she remember we and let we right in .<ssssss>super.excursions : carribean festival boat ride be cool .<ssssss>do some snorkeling but it be a little too crowded and everyone seem on top of each other once we get in the water due to the other boat go to the same area .<ssssss>also go into a nurse shark cage swimming with they .<ssssss>a lot of fun .<ssssss>there be a shop on the beach and they be a bit pushy try to get we to buy stuff .<ssssss>another excursion be the saona island excusion which be great .<ssssss>we be take they by catamaran and be lucky enough to be approach by a group of dolphins-simply beautiful .<ssssss>the beach be nice and there be food and drink there .<ssssss>i stick to just beer because i do not want to get sick again .<ssssss>then they take you on a speedboat to a point off the coast where you be in waist deep water , but quite away out at sea off of dr. really cool .<ssssss>last you stop off at a mini shopping center on the bus ride back with not much of a selection .<ssssss>the people in the shop seem nice and be not pushy .<ssssss>a hour and a half bus ride -lrb- at least -rrb- each way .<ssssss>about a 11 hour day.the short coming of the room and the food be balance out by the great people , scenery , and excursion .<ssssss>if i know i would not get sick i would go back in a heartbeat , but like mexico , the dr do not agree with my stomach .<ssssss>we meet another couple who actually be on they honeymoon and they be place by the construction , then move to a room where the shower be not work , then move somewhere else due to another problem which escape my mind at the moment .<ssssss>the also have the same problem at check in that we do .<ssssss>i also hear people at the pool complain about the delay check in as well .<ssssss>plus they be go as group , but separated and situate all over the hotel property .<ssssss>two of they kid be give a room and when they enter the room there be couple in bed already in the room !!!<ssssss>again , this be not the most organize operation , so you might want to double lock you door while you be in you room .<ssssss>if you do decide to go , bring a lot of $ 1 bill - they go a long way .<ssssss>change of bigger bill be a pain to get because you have to go to the bank by the lobby.liquor seem more expensive than other island i have be too -lrb- st. thomas , barbado , antigua , pr , dominica , and turk -rrb- .<ssssss>aruba be more expensive though ;-rrb- have fun !<ssssss>

3 4 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		good for the budget , could use some update after read many review on this hotel we be hesitant to stay here but decide thearea be where we want to be and the price be right .<ssssss>the brochure describe thehotel as update and show some nice room picture , unfortunately they all do not looklike the picture show .<ssssss>this older hotel definately need more freshen up.we complain of the 1st room they show , in need of update .<ssssss>the 2nd room wasok but it face busy van ness ave , too noisy .<ssssss>we be show a 3rd room on the 5thfloor face towards the pool and we have fabulous view , a much better room we decidedto stay .<ssssss>the room face in towards the pool seem much nicer .<ssssss>avoid the very back of thehotel face private residence , room be not as nice and need major updates.the room we have on the 5th floor be much nicer , bed be comfortable , full bath/shower , fridge and microwave .<ssssss>fridge be nice to have we be there for 5 nights.area be great , 15-20min walk to fisherman 's wharf , transportation close by , get a munitransit pass , they be well worth the money , we travel all over the city .<ssssss>take a walkone block up to polk st , many restaurant , shop , very trendy area with the youngercrowd .<ssssss>you can walk to many nice area or hop on the bus in front of the hotel.they have a good continental breakfast : cereal , toast , bagel , friut , danish , etc. a nicepool area , be noisy in the evening but quiet down quickly after 10:30 pm .<ssssss>after our5 day stay we decide the hotel be not as bad as other have complain , yes it hasit 's fault but what other hotel do not and i would rather spend half the money on ahotel and spend the rest enjoy this fabulous city with it be friendly people .<ssssss>we hardly spend any time at the hotel during the day but find it comfortable for a good night sleep , this place be no ritz carlton , so stay elsewhere if you expect better !<ssssss>
3 3 3 3 4 5 -1 5		basic quite hotel do not book this hotel .<ssssss>be send to eurostar mitre from another hotel -lrb- gran ducat -rrb- that overbook and make a deal to send we here instead .<ssssss>i be upset that i pay city center price to then be send to mitre as it be about 4 train -lrb- metro -rrb- stop from city center and for the same price we get this secluded hotel.pros : hotel be in a quite residential area , strong air conditioner , very helpful front-desk staff , matrimonial bed be actually a real double-bed instead of 2 twin push together , very clean room , good quality towels.cons : cable work once my husband spend a few minute mess with the back of the tv , very small bathroom , tiny elevator , away from city center , no real restaurant or shop around there , not near the tour bus route.i really can not fault the hotel even with the con i list above.maybe i be just more upset because i know have i book mitre directly it would have be cheaper than fall for the overbooking scam gran ducat have go on.if you do not mind stay a bit away from city center and want a quite place away from the chaos then this hotel be the place to stay.the metro stop puxtet be just a few short step from the hotel so not much of a hassle and train go directly without transfer to city center.again , many thanks to the front desk staff for be so helpful , take lot of time to explain the metro and recommend sightseeing options.because the hotel be nowhere near other eat place we pay the 10 euro per person for the breakfast and it be worth it .<ssssss>- joananew yorker living in germany<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 2 3 5 -1		disappoint with this hotel we stay in this hotel for 2 night in october '08 prior to we cruise .<ssssss>the lobby area be nice and bright but as soon as we get into the elevator we find there be a terrible musky smell.the room be date and tire look -lrb- i suppose much like ourselves when we arrive , have travel a long distance from ireland ! -rrb-<ssssss>breakfast in the dining room be very nice and the wait staff be friendly.my biggest gripe about this hotel be that on check out on the sunday morning we wait at least 15 minute for a elevator and even then when we eventually all crowd into one , luggage and all , it keep go up and down to the different floor open the door to let people on who could not because they be full.looking back it be quite funny because we keep see the same people wait to get on at each floor and they be wonder why we be still there !<ssssss>now there be a notice on the elevator state that they do get quite busy at check out times.we could not use the stair even if we want to because this only bring you to a emergency exit .<ssssss>the hotel be obviously aware of the problem give the notice they have post inside the elevator but yet seem to do nothing about it.you can not bring you luggage down the night before you check out and get they to store it for you as there be a notice up about this also .<ssssss>therefore everyone be try to cram into the elevator , luggage and all , on the morning of departure with two elevator at you disposal .<ssssss>i definitely would not recommend this hotel in view of the total chaos on check out morning .<ssssss>

they finally admit one of the stewardess call in sick and they be wait for a replacement .<ssssss>my 7 year old be cry because he think we flight would get cancel .<ssssss>we finally make it to punta cana a couple of hour late .<ssssss>at the airport we pose for picture and pick up we bag and go to we hotel .<ssssss>check in be quick then the time share lady be all over me.two of we room be full of mold .<ssssss>i share a room with my son and my 30 year old nephew .<ssssss>all 3 of we have asthma and mold be all over the wall and even the art work on the wall .<ssssss>the dresser also smell of mold .<ssssss>i do not care what anyone tell you .<ssssss>they be lie if they say this be normal because it be a hot country near the water .<ssssss>i have be to jamaica 10 time and to mexico 6 time .<ssssss>there be not suppose to be mold or mildew in you room , nor any kind of bug and this include ant .<ssssss>if people want to be surround by dirt and bug on vacation they could just go camping .<ssssss>it be the resort duty to spray the grounds and room and do what-ever they have to do to keep they clean .<ssssss>anyway i send my nephew to the front desk to ask for another room .<ssssss>we be tell we would have to wait until the next day .<ssssss>my nephew talk to the manager and explain that with we asthma sleep in that room could kill we but he be tell that all the room be full until the next day .<ssssss>my friend in the other room with the mold be tell the same thing .<ssssss>i look around the room for a place to set out some clothes for my little one .<ssssss>i end up put a towel on the closet floor and lie out we clothes on that .<ssssss>the next day my friend be move to a new room .<ssssss>this room also have lot of mildew .<ssssss>they ask for another room on the second floor .<ssssss>they get it , so they end up move 3 time .<ssssss>we call about we new room and be tell none be available .<ssssss>i explain again that be in that room could kill all of we but they say there be nothing they could do and that the manager would not be in until the next day .<ssssss>that night my nephew have a bad asthma attack but i have make he bring he deep breathing machine and after use that he feel better .<ssssss>the next day i be at the front desk bright and early look for the manager .<ssssss>he explain that everyone want to be closer to the pool and beach and that all the room have be take the day before move those people .<ssssss>well i guess i look as if i be go to explode because i have to shut my eye and count to ten before i could say another word .<ssssss>i tell he that he move people to be closer to the pool when three people could have die in they sleep because of they asthma .<ssssss>thing move quickly then and he move we himself to a upgrade room .<ssssss>it be beautiful and after that we be all determine to enjoy we stay.i love the building in the square .<ssssss>everything be there .<ssssss>at some resort the restaurant be spread all over the place , which mean lot of walk but here all of they be close together.it do not do we much good because by the time we get to the square each night the wait be too long to get into any of the restaurant .<ssssss>we do get to eat at the mexican and like the food there .<ssssss>my nephew find that at route 66 if you tell they you just want take-out they would let one person in to order and wait for the food .<ssssss>he would do this most night and take the tram back to the room with the food .<ssssss>he could even bring we back ice-cream this way without it melting .<ssssss>there be a wonderful vibe to the resort .<ssssss>the staff and the guest be very friendly .<ssssss>most guest wave and say hello when you pass by .<ssssss>one of my friend and i go on the outback safari .<ssssss>we love this as it give we a chance to see the country side and meet the people .<ssssss>we really love see the local kid ride they horse and donkey and wave hello at we .<ssssss>the beach they take you to for boogie board be cover with trash which be too bad but itha a beautiful view.i think the pool be big and there be lot of kid for my son to swim with everyday .<ssssss>i do not enjoy the beach that much .<ssssss>i think it be small and sometimes it be hard to get a place in the shade .<ssssss>also on the beach some of the lounger in the shade be place 4 or 5 in a row and you would end up lie next to stranger who might not want you be that close to they .<ssssss>i feel uncomfortable one day have to lay next to this one couple who clearly do not want I there in what they hope would be a romantic time alone .<ssssss>overall we have a good time at this resort and i would go there again and tell my friend to go there .<ssssss>at the airport on the way home there be a new part of the airport that be air condition .<ssssss>my friend fly a different airline and they gate be in a different place and they say they have no air .<ssssss>so if you have a long wait for you flight look for this area .<ssssss>there be some shop in there also for booze and cigarettes.the trip home on american be a nightmare .<ssssss>we flight be late leave punta cana and late get into miami .<ssssss>then we wait for a disabled plane to be tow from we gate and after wait 20 minute until it be do they decide to move we to a different gate anyway .<ssssss>this gate be way across the airport from immigration and custom .<ssssss>one of we bag be the last one off the plane so we be behind everybody and when we finally make it to we gate american say because check we bag again would take too long we would have to miss we flight home to detroit .<ssssss>the lady say they would not pay for a hotel for we overnight because it be we fault that it take so long to get through immigration and custom .<ssssss>again i have to close my eye and count to ten .<ssssss>i ask for a supervisor and have to go downstairs and wait in a long line behind other people who have miss they flight .<ssssss>i know that everything that happen with these plane in document in they computer and the supervisor look up we flight and could see everything that happen .<ssssss>so they give we a free room -lrb- dump -rrb- for the night at the airport and first class ticket for the fight home the next day but nothing for food .<ssssss>but it ment fly to chicago and then on to detroit .<ssssss>after we board the plane in chicago we sit on the runway for a hour wait for a thunder storm to leave detroit .<ssssss>while we sit there a big storm hit the airport in chicago .<ssssss>lot of nail bite on we part about this flight get cancel and the pilot say he think it would , but finally he say to hurry up and buckle up so we could take off before they change they mind .<ssssss>i try to save money by take american instead of leave a few day sooner on a charter flight with apple vacation .<ssssss>usually charter be always cheaper with apple but not this time .<ssssss>i could have take the charter because it cost a arm and a leg buying airport food and i spend a lot try to calm my son both way with pizza and ice cream and anything else he want .<ssssss>this be why i always buy travel insurance and believe I i have put in a claim and send they all of my receipts.again the ocean blue be good value for the money , just insist that you get a decent room .<ssssss>
3 4 3 -1 4 -1 2 -1		mixed review for el conquistador i just return from el conquistador from a stay with 2 older child 16 and 20 .<ssssss>we opinion be definitely mixed .<ssssss>the shuttle from the airport take nearly 2 hour when we arrive and over a hour even for the 5am return shuttle and cost we $ 192 round trip for 3 traveller .<ssssss>we room be average but conveniently located on the main part of the hotel for the pool , casino , etc. my daughter and i have to ask 4 different people before we could figure out how to get to the fitness center - a elevator plus funicula ride away .<ssssss>sometimes it take 15 minute to get the funicula back to the main hotel .<ssssss>it also take awhile to get to the beach - funicula ride plus water taxi that only run every half hour .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful but the bottom be rocky in part .<ssssss>service be relax to say the least .<ssssss>we frequently have to ask multiple time to get thing but on the other hand you can sit in the casino bar and watch the yankee game and no one will hassle you to buy drink .<ssssss>staff be friendly but have no sense of urgency and checking in can take huge amount of time .<ssssss>overall my child and i really enjoy the beautiful beach and pool and be very relax .<ssssss>we find the buffet breakfast the best value for the money .<ssssss>the food be expensive but typical of resort and there be 16 restaurant to choose from so there be always somewhere to eat where you do not have to wait which be a plus .<ssssss>overall we enjoy we stay despite the drawback .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 3 3 -1		place be a dump !<ssssss>this place be a dump .<ssssss>the place be old and dirty , more like a 2 star hotel with dirty sheet and carpet .<ssssss>the place be right out of a bad seventy movie , everything about it be old and worn .<ssssss>i would avoid this place and wait till the new tower be build .<ssssss>the location be ok but the hotel like a motel 6 at best .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		good price , good location .<ssssss>my wife and i stay in the chelsea lodge for 2 night in late april 2006 .<ssssss>the chelsea lodge be in a nice and in we opinion safe area .<ssssss>shop , bar , restaurant be a minute away , the subway less than 10 minute .<ssssss>the property appear to be a convert house/apartments and have a lot of character .<ssssss>we room be very small but in agreement with other review be clean .<ssssss>my complaint be no toilet in the room , lack of sound proofing -lrb- noise from other guest in the corridor etc -rrb- , limited space for store clothes and no safe .<ssssss>the hotel also do not have a lift.the staff be friendly and accommodate and for the money it be good value .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 5 2 2 1		very disappointing book for 3 day as a stop on the way home from the east .<ssssss>when book i inquire about the cancellation policy , as always .<ssssss>i be tell that i would be liable for at least one night , even if i do not stay at all .<ssssss>upon arrival , i have become quite ill and inform the desk at check-in that i would only be stay 1 night .<ssssss>the desk attendant say that be no problem and that they would credit my credit card for the 2 night .<ssssss>another person overhear this and the whisper into the clek 's ear and all of a sudden they policy change !!!!<ssssss>i be stick with payingfor 3 night despite leave the next morning!i will not even go into the intenet problem !<ssssss>that it do not even work in the guest room , as promise , be the least of the issues.the room be ok , but european small .<ssssss>the location be great if you be into the art museum but pretty far from everything else.would not stay there again .<ssssss>amsterdam seem to have many better option .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 1 2 1		good location but very old and dirty room the hotel be very well located and practically everything be accessible from there .<ssssss>we have problem when check in , because theycould not find we reservation even with we receipt and ref .<ssssss>number .<ssssss>.<ssssss>poor performance of the staff on this section .<ssssss>the first impressionat the lobby be great but not once we enter in we room which be old , dirty and with a terrible view of old house 's roof .<ssssss>the bath be not enough clean , specially in the shower area.heating be not work properly in the room , so it be cold .<ssssss>the person in charge of the business center , a chinese lady be very rude and lack of customer focus .<ssssss>she initial word be if you want to use internet be aware the cost be 2 yuan -lrb- $ 0.25 -rrb- per minute.the main restaurant be good .<ssssss>excellent buffet the main value of this hotel be just its location , but it do not have the quality service of the novotel hotal chain .<ssssss>this be the first time we be highly dissapointed by a novotel hotel , and it be not cheap !<ssssss>
4 5 3 4 5 3 3 3		great value , enjoyable stay .<ssssss>the deluxe room , with view of chruch<ssssss>

2 3 5 5 5 2 2 5		nice but ... .<ssssss>i must start by say it be a beautiful resort the decor be remarkable and very somptuous this be really a 5 * have for that matter.we have take the royal service but like the other review point it be not need .<ssssss>the buttler be hardly ever there or if he be , forget you reservation either for the restaurant or the beach palapa .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the beach be ok but lot of sea herb , but this be the ocean?food be not very good in punta cana but if you have to pick a restaurant at the resort the vento be the best and choose the beef rossilinus .<ssssss>we have problem with the air condition in the room bur they come and fix it in 5 minute .<ssssss>but on saturday night they have no air condition in restaurant and it be so hot .<ssssss>it be resolve the next day.the entertainment show and the music in restaurant be bad techno music very loud .<ssssss>they could put other kind of music at the gaby beach restaurant for the royal service only .<ssssss>people be around 45 and plus ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>in the lobby no music on sunday night and wednesday .<ssssss>the piano be until 7:30 and nothing after that ???<ssssss>guess it be for people who like reading during vacation .<ssssss>this time the weather be very windy and hardly any sunshine ?<ssssss>
2 2 3 3 5 1 1 4		better choice available i be a native new orleanian and at the time be live about 100 mile away and travel back and forth for business and leisure weekly .<ssssss>i routinely stay at the omnus royal orlean as well as the sheraton on canal street for the same approximate price and have find the staff to be much more friendly at those hotel than at le pavilion .<ssssss>the room can be very small , minibar ridiculously expensive -lrb- even for new orlean -rrb- , and the parking very high .<ssssss>also , i happen to stay the last time during some event and have to wear a wristband to get to my room like i be a kid on spring break .<ssssss>very obnoxious .<ssssss>i cut it off because i could not sleep with it on and they charge I $ 35 for another one in the morning after i be refuse access to the elevator to my room !<ssssss>not a terrible hotel , quite beautiful lobby and close to the superdome but there be much better choice available in the french quarter .<ssssss>
4 3 2 4 5 5 5 5		great - save the austere room .<ssssss>a bit bleak<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 4 1 1 1		average hotel with bourbon st noise this hotel building use to be a chemical warehouse in the quarter not too long ago .<ssssss>they forget to tell you that.okay , the room we be in have no ceiling fan .<ssssss>it do have a small television and coffee maker .<ssssss>the coffee be very good .<ssssss>the complimentary breakfast be awful ; just look at it couldn t eat it .<ssssss>the breakfast area be in a glass cage with a bunch of guest sit and grab free coffee and orange juice .<ssssss>avoid the deja vu bar across the street which be a hang out for the bad guy and girl .<ssssss>the noise unfortunately from bourbon street be like a boom box-not loud but can feel it viberate in the early be hour - it will wake you up .<ssssss>the bombay club cost minimum $ 8-10 for a very small 6 oz a drink plus tip .<ssssss>hotel be good for a 1-2 night stay , on business or bourbon street fun .<ssssss>it be definitely not for family or kid .<ssssss>also as other have mention here , the staff be completely unfriendly and not courteous .<ssssss>overall , if you can t afford a good hotel , this could be a option .<ssssss>try the hotel st loui as a nice option .<ssssss>very basic , acceptable , a three of five star .<ssssss>hope this help .<ssssss>
2 2 5 5 4 5 4 2		so so resort my family and i travel to majestic colonial in july 07 .<ssssss>the resort be lovely , beautiful grounds , room and beach very nice .<ssssss>the problem lie with the food/restaurants .<ssssss>food be not good .<ssssss>choice be horrible .<ssssss>breakfast buffet close at 10am , if you arrive at 10:01 be you be out of luck .<ssssss>each of the speciality a la carte restaurant feature a buffet where you go and get you salad , appetizer , and dessert .<ssssss>the only item you be order be the main entree .<ssssss>so forget a long , relax dinner .<ssssss>they have you in and out very quickly .<ssssss>while we arent picky eater , when we vacation we like a nice dinner .<ssssss>sit around enjoy conversation , good food and drink .<ssssss>not in and out in a hour.they also blast spanish disco music on the beach and by the pool all day .<ssssss>not relax and if you dont care for this type of music it can be a drag to lye on the beach read a book and listen to the surf .<ssssss>
3 3 3 3 5 4 3 5		not horrible not wonderful .<ssssss>we room<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 5 5 3		no fuss convenience .<ssssss>outlook from mantra bond street<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 3 1 2 -1		high and low and some friendly advise .<ssssss>like the other review reveal , this hotel be a mixed bag .<ssssss>on the plus side , be its central location at the tip of the ` tongue ' and at the center of the centrum .<ssssss>the neighbor and define flower market be both kind of cheesey but endearing especially when you see how a couple tullip can brighten up you room .<ssssss>the van gogh museum be a walk and sometimes a taxi be more appealing but expensive at @ 9euro from this location .<ssssss>the room and hall really need attention .<ssssss>american will not be satisfy with the standard room which be like cell with window .<ssssss>we pay the extra 25euro upgrade to the delux/superior room which be twice the size and very hospitable and we particular room on a high floor enjoy colorful view with lot to see .<ssssss>i would recommend the hotel combine the small room into small suite , for famile .<ssssss>dinner on chrismta eve at the excelsior a restaurant across the river be excellent , and the hotel be near some other good restaurant ; however , the service the jolly hotel offer need a little attention , for instance there be a 8euro service charge for mediocre room service with top tier menu price too .<ssssss>the bed and bedding be a little flat and seem worn and of questionable quality , the hall be a little dark with low ceiling .<ssssss>the front desk be uneven .<ssssss>some people be very helpful other perhaps not so much , but in general i enjoy my stay at the hotel however i do not see myself stay there again , but the hotel do offer some advantage because of its location , -lrb- sometimes too -rrb- informal and friendly staff and reasonably price accommodation .<ssssss>i could the see this hotel get better with classic refurbishment and some thoughtful redesign .<ssssss>2.5 star but could be higher with some inprovement .<ssssss>
4 5 -1 5 5 3 4 3		great -lrb- and very different -rrb- airport hotel great hotel for the price .<ssssss>high design , with funky feel .<ssssss>room be tiny , but very well think out - feel kind of like you be in a yacht .<ssssss>great lighting and interactive room control .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 3 3 1		alright for the price and location .<ssssss>pic from hallway into the room , ancient tv , dark decor<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 5 -1 5 -1		nice place , but ... .<ssssss>we stay at the kaiulanus from march21-april 4th this year .<ssssss>check in be a snap , and we be upgrade to a deluxe ocean view in the princess wing , on the 9th floor .<ssssss>the room be a tad small , but clean and nicely furnish with two double and a sofa bed.we discover that the pillow be feather , my husand be allergic .<ssssss>housekeeping have replacement pillow send up with 10 minute !!!<ssssss>the staff , from front desk , to housekeeping to maintenance to pool desk be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>we housekeeper be wonderful as well .<ssssss>she keep the room immaculate , even wash and dry we personal drinking glass we bring from home.i do not like the price at the restaurant .<ssssss>we never eat there .<ssssss>and the pool side drink be a $ tronomical !!<ssssss>the bed be very uncomfortable , i have to double up the bedspread and put they under the bottom sheet to make thing a little more softer .<ssssss>and i guess the first few day we have no neighbour , but on night 3 or 4 we hear a guy snore , and a phone ringing that never get answer .<ssssss>then we hear a baby cry for a extended amount of time too .<ssssss>they sound be very clear .<ssssss>and the street noise be very loud .<ssssss>i agree with the other poster .<ssssss>there be a drummer outside that bang those $ % $ % drum every time somebody put money in he hat !!<ssssss>we be tempt to pay he $ 50 to move to another block !!!<ssssss>like i say the staff be exceptional , but the noise be a little too much , and the bed too hard .<ssssss>i would probably not stay here again , unless of course , they replace the mattress , and work on some sound proofing .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 3 -1		great place to stay we stay at the ocean resort april 19-23 .<ssssss>i have read a few negative review before we trip and be a little apprehensive about what we would find but i be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>yes , the hotel need work in some area but we room be very clean and a good size .<ssssss>we have a suite without a ocean view but have a coffee pot , toaster , refrigerator , hot plate and microwave .<ssssss>we have to wait a few minute for the elevator at time but the wait be no longer than the wait time i have in the office building where i work .<ssssss>the location be great and be very close to the beach and zoo .<ssssss>for the rate we pay per night , i would definitely recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 5 5 2		city break in florence warm and friendly service in this conveniently located , clean and comfortable hotel .<ssssss>very central : only a few minute walk to duomo andclose to station .<ssssss>a tourist information office be located across the road from the europa and pleasantly surprise we by provide detailsof where to obtain ticket for the uffizi gallery -lrb- 13 euro -rrb- .<ssssss>we have think we have leave it too late to gain entrance without queue endlessly or pay through the nose for a guide tour -lrb- about 45 euro -rrb- .<ssssss>in summer month , it be probably wiser to book ahead online for the uffizi rather than leave it to chance - i think we be lucky .<ssssss>buffet breakfast pleasant with variety of coffee available , though personally would also have enjoy have coffee make facility in room .<ssssss>room and bathroom spacious with good air conditioning system .<ssssss>have to admit that the ` suite ' category conjuredup something even more exotic .<ssssss>still , we be satisfy with the reasonable price for a fantastic location in a family run , welcome and well run hotel .<ssssss>
3 2 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		average definitely past its sell-by date .<ssssss>even with a platinum upgrade to the club floor the room be dark , furnishings just on the good side of become shabby , bathroom the same and the water pressure in the shower almost non-existent .<ssssss>the food be pretty poor and expensive and there be a very limited room service choice .<ssssss>it be also unbelieveable that they be still charge for internet access , even for platinum customer , when smaller hotel be give it away .<ssssss>have say that , it be clean and the staff be excellent .<ssssss>i receive one of the most pleasant welcome from the duty manager that i have receive in any hotel in the world in seven year of intensive travel .<ssssss>if you need a airport hotel and get a great rate then it be fine .<ssssss>why would i stay there again rather than one of the better option in the area ?<ssssss>the sweet sleeper bed make up for a lot of fault .<ssssss>
3 -1 3 5 4 5 3 -1		well , for the money ... .<ssssss>stay at the moore of 4 night in july 2008 .<ssssss>the location be excellent , central for what you will want to see in seattle .<ssssss>not far from pike place market , close enough for breakfast !<ssssss>we be in one of the top floor room with a shared bathroom .<ssssss>generally , it be just ok , but for what tou pay , i do n'tthink it can be better .<ssssss>it be clean , comfortable , and excellent value for money<ssssss>
3 3 5 2 5 4 4 1		just nice .<ssssss>we stay at the bahia prinicipe the week of april 21 thru april 28 .<ssssss>it be a very big and nice resort .<ssssss>we supose to stay in bavaro side but due to overbook they give we club premier room .<ssssss>the farest place to the beach but quietly and clean with a private pool .<ssssss>we have 4 a la carte rezervation but we use only 2 because the buffet be ok and we do not like the food at the restaurant .<ssssss>-lrb- the italian one be a joke -rrb- .<ssssss>the drink be ordinary to poor .<ssssss>if you want something good you have to pay extra.the room it be very nice .<ssssss>big and clean with everything you need inside .<ssssss>the a.c. be very eficient.the pool and the beach ok too .<ssssss>big and clean , but the towel look very use and need to be replace .<ssssss>the watersport be allmost miss .<ssssss>6 day from 7 we have red flag and everything be on the ground .<ssssss>do not forget this be a atlantic ocean 's beach and the wave be big enough .<ssssss>diving and deep sea fishing be just waste time and money.all in all it be nice but i would not go back again ...<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 5 5 3		nothing special , no problem stay at the menzy for two night and find its central location fantastic.while the lobby be quite grand and beautiful , the room be really a bit old and tired .<ssssss>there be nothing actually wrong with the room , make for a pleasant stay , we just find it be a bit dark and stale.really no other complaint , we get room service during the night , which be lovely and the staff be all helpful and courteous .<ssssss>would stay again for the price .<ssssss>
2 5 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		so noisy !<ssssss>the room be nice , clean , spacious , modern .<ssssss>really excellent .<ssssss>however , we have ask for a quiet room .<ssssss>the friendly concierge say he would put we on the quiet side of the building .<ssssss>we have check in at about 2 be -lrb- another good thing : 24 hour desk -rrb- .<ssssss>at about 9 be i wake up to the delightful sound of heavy construction .<ssssss>quite confused , i look out the window to see 10 or 20 worker on scaffolding about 10 meter from we room .<ssssss>quiet side of the building ?<ssssss>when we call the front desk to complain , they say that be the quiet side of the building , not mean to say that it be , in fact , the quieter side of the building , but mean that we be liar and we must be confuse as to what the word quiet means .<ssssss>very strange .<ssssss>horrible experience .<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 4 5 5 2		good downtown location this be a great hotel to stay at if you have lot of downtown seattle activite plan .<ssssss>we spend three night here and be not disappoint .<ssssss>the only complaint i have -lrb- which really be minor in the scheme of thing -rrb- be that there be only one computer in the lobby with internet access and it be really difficult to get on it with the hotel be very busy .<ssssss>i think for the size and capacity of this hotel , they should definitely have a second or even a third computer .<ssssss>i also think that traveler who want to spend time on myspace and other site like that should bring they own computer and have the common courtesy to not monopolize the only computer available for guest .<ssssss>with that be say , the rest of we time here be great.public transportation have a pick up right in front of the hotel .<ssssss>we opt for this for trip to pike place market , as parking down there would have cost we $ 15 and the bus cost we $ 6.50 round trip .<ssssss>we walk to the space needle , restaurant , and also walk to the dock of the victoria clipper -lrb- pier 69 -rrb- .<ssssss>we find it much easier -lrb- mostly beacuse of parking price -rrb- , and leave we rental car park in the gate parking lot beneath the hotel .<ssssss>breakfast be abundant , but the breakfast room be warm and always full so we do take the food back to we room .<ssssss>the people at the front desk be incredibly friendly and helpful with travel idea , bus route , restaurant suggestion , etc. the mariner be in town and they have sign-up sheet at the front desk for shuttle to the game for $ 5/person .<ssssss>we have a room that have a slide glass door to a outdoor area where everyone from the hotel have access to .<ssssss>i be not happy the first day back when we curtain have be open by the housekeeper so everyone could see in and see what we have .<ssssss>the next day the curtain be keep close which i be thankful for .<ssssss>we room be always make up and clean very well .<ssssss>i do a load of laundry and find it reasonable at $ 1.50 per machine to wash and dry .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 2 -1 -1		disgust place .<ssssss>this be possibly the worst place i have ever stay in .<ssssss>the tile on ourfloor be break and miss , my husband fall on a slip tile and almost break he back .<ssssss>the mattress be hard as cement , and the pillow be worse .<ssssss>i have to roll a towel up and use it instead of a pillow -- it be softer , and that be say a lot .<ssssss>the breakfast be awful , pre-packaged croiissant , coffee out of a instant machine -lrb- not pod , but the old fashion drippy stuff that you would put a coin into at a rest stop , minus the coin , and this be italy -- land of cappuccino , espresso latte ! -rrb-<ssssss>there be a million step and the place be very dirty , there be not even a place for the toilet paper to hang up , it be stuff behind the radiator to keep it off the floor .<ssssss>beautiful view , however , that be the only good point , and of course the location .<ssssss>but we leave after one night , need a decent night sleep .<ssssss>the place have enormous potential , but it be old , dreary and run down , need some serious money pump into it to bring it up to par .<ssssss>
3 1 4 4 5 2 3 -1		other must be talk about a different -lrb- better -rrb- hotel !!??<ssssss>if this be the sheraton right accross the street from the frankfurt airport -lrb- the only airport hotel i know of -rrb- , then what be people compliment this hotel experience for ?<ssssss>almost every positive review seem to be from business traveller which be too bad ; i think this site be for traveller , not people travel on a expense account .<ssssss>business traveller have very different expectation and , therefor , have very different perception .<ssssss>* this hotel be a complete waste of money for real traveller !<ssssss>and i do not care when you flight come in/leaves !!!<ssssss>* the front desk be very hard to get to/find from the street level .<ssssss>also , most of the front desk staff be occupy help people with sheraton cards/id 's , leave one overworked gentleman help the rest of we .<ssssss>i finally get check in after about thirty minute , for over $ 400 for the one night -lrb- !!! -rrb-<ssssss>, and it be flush with the service elevator shaft .<ssssss>because of the noise and several complaint , i finally get my room switch at around 0200 when someone could assist I .<ssssss>the other review say the pool be nice .<ssssss>pool ?<ssssss>not at the sheraton i stay at , unless it be be repair .<ssssss>the restaurant -lrb- they have you trap there -rrb- be horrible as far as value for money go , with meager/average dish at insane price -lrb- again i be not on a expense account ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>it be a better idea , if you have to stay there -lrb- like if you lose a bet -rrb- to eat accross the street at the airport .<ssssss>for over $ 400 i do not even get breakfast .<ssssss>i put all of these concern in a note to the manger and never hear back .<ssssss>real traveller would best be serve stay in mainz -lrb- or even frankfurt , where a nice business class hotel - if that be what you want - will run you less than half of the airport sheraton -rrb- and take one of the many short , regular train to the airport .<ssssss>leave this over-priced monstrosity to the business traveller who have no choice , and i hope these same traveller will stop skewing these review with they thought .<ssssss>this be a average name-brand airport hotel with delusion of grandeur and price to match the delusion !<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 2 -1 5 4		tourist class hotel/dingy room we stay here for 4 night in november while attend a conference .<ssssss>a very beautiful lobby be as a quite misleading open to the room .<ssssss>the hallway be bland and unappealing .<ssssss>although clean , the room be extremely small for two people , the rug be old , mattress hard and uncomfortable , bathroom have granite counter but floor and bathtub need cleaning and along with a stain shower curtain .<ssssss>fortunately , we be busy all day so we only have to spend evening hour here .<ssssss>it call itself a five star hotel but what i find out about china be that once one earn this rating it be never re-evaluate .<ssssss>this may have be a 5-star 20 year ago but it be barely a 2-3 star today.on the positive side , the cater for the conference be excellent .<ssssss>in addition , the staff be very responsive to the customer , e.g. , we have a problem with we tv and someone come to the room in less than 1 minute .<ssssss>any other similar request be handle in the same manner .<ssssss>it be as if someone be position on each floor to respond immediately .<ssssss>so , kudos to they for excellent customer service!perhaps it be ungrateful to complain because we room and board be be pay for by peke university as speaker at the beijing forum and we appreciate this very much .<ssssss>
2 1 2 5 1 5 5 1		terrific service but sorely in need of update as a dallas resident , i have always want a excuse to stay at this storied hotel in my own home town .<ssssss>recently -- due to a small home renovation -- i decide to take a small in-town vacation and book a room at the mansion on turtle creek.the staff at the mansion be wonderful -- they anticipate my need and bent over backwards to be friendly accommodate .<ssssss>the valet staff in particular deserve kudos for run back and forth for my car in 106 degree texa heat !<ssssss>the front desk staff make sure that message be promptly deliver and be gracious with my frequent service requests.and therein lie the problem .<ssssss>my service request be frequent -- almost daily .<ssssss>the safe fail to work after i have place my item inside .<ssssss>the air conditioning unit make a click noise every 20 seconds throughout the evening until the staff finally get it fix about 8 hour later .<ssssss>the hot water take almost 15 minute to get to the texa size soak tub .<ssssss>-lrb- they tell I this be due to the low occupancy in the hotel .<ssssss>huh ? -rrb-<ssssss>each time someone flush a toilet or take a shower the water pressure would make a rush noise through the plumbing loud enough to be hear in the main bedroom .<ssssss>i could go on but you get the idea.the premier room that i be assign -lrb- room 412 -rrb- have very dated furniture .<ssssss>not in a good english country house way but in a overuse and confuse decorator look .<ssssss>i be not hope or look for over-the-top but neither be i expect a return to the 1980 's .<ssssss>honestly , i think perhaps my expectation be too high so i invite a friend to visit my room and give I she opinion .<ssssss>shock may be a slight exaggeration ... ok , maybe not .<ssssss>even she notice that the black and gold bedding be old and the chenille occasional chair be stain and dirty .<ssssss>the parson 's chair at the bathroom vanity be so stain that i lay a towel on it before sit down .<ssssss>i be sorely disappointed and think most of you reviewer would be better serve stay elsewhere -- anywhere else .<ssssss>sorry mansion personnel !<ssssss>

2 3 2 4 2 4 4 -1		sad for rest of la hotel that this be # 1 we stay for four night over christmas .<ssssss>there be some really great thing about the hotel - staff seem very jolly , the free minus bar ; basically you can select soft drink , chip , candy from a huge selection - for free , 24 hour a day .<ssssss>the continental breakfast be not really gourmet , but certainly there be some nice pastry and hey - it be free !<ssssss>on the downside we room be barely big enough for cat swinging and the recent renovation themselves look like they need some renovate .<ssssss>we main complaint be that we room be really noisy .<ssssss>the wall be paper thin and , apparently unlike the other guest , we be in the minority as we like to sleep until 9.30 be or so when we be on vacation .<ssssss>sadly we be wake daily at 7am by stomp up and down stair outside , door slam and whoever happen to be in the room next door - thanks to a adjoining door they literally sound as though they be in the same room as we .<ssssss>also slightly off-putting - the ashtray for we floor be right outside we window and by we air conditioning unit so a few time we have the a/c on only to find moment later we room smell of smoke .<ssssss>also pretty annoying be the lack of regulation of hot water in the shower - every day there be leap in and out of the stream of water from either be scald or freeze .<ssssss>it be a sad indictment of la hotel that this be rank the best hotel - it be not the worst i have ever stay in , but it be no star .<ssssss>all in all the location be pretty good , and rate reasonable , if you be a smoker that do not need much sleep/privacy and be ok with a invigorating game of hot/cold in the shower every morning this be the perfect place for you !<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 2 5 3 -1		i have a free room two thing , first.one , i be picky.two , this stay be free for I as a friend be attend a conference and she husband could not join she -- i be ask if i would like to come along and well , i work for a airline and get nearly free airfare and so , what could i say ?<ssssss>i went.so , check in be a breeze -- huge , open air lobby with plenty of check-in station and wonderful local girl -lrb- sorry , do not remember she name -rrb- help we .<ssssss>the friend i be stay with be a hilton gold , so i make a big deal of that to the agent -- to be sure we get a good room as this be also my first trip to hnl .<ssssss>and we did.my friend go to park the car and i go to we room on the 34th floor of the 35 floor of the tapa tower .<ssssss>the room be make up , but the previous guest 's bill be still on the floor on the other side of the door when i walk in ... the room smell like stale cigarette smoke ... but i open the lania door and get a load of that incredible view diamond head and the ocean -lrb- odd number room face diamond head -rrb- , and well , i still feel it necessary to call and see if any other room , as nice , be available as both of we be non-smoker .<ssssss>i have also notice that there be cigarette ash on the table by the chair by the lanai door -- it appear that the table have not be wipe off , even .<ssssss>in the meantime , the bellman bring we luggage , while i be on the phone get another room and we get switch to 1 floor below , same side of the building .<ssssss>well , that room stunk like smoke , too .<ssssss>and it just do not seem as nice , so we move back up to the original room .<ssssss>they be suppose to send house-keeping up to clean off the table and spray some air freshener -- that never happen .<ssssss>in fact , we be there 4 night and that table never get wipe clean the entire time we be there .<ssssss>all hotel room in honolulu/waikiki be suppose to be non-smoking , now -- but be that possible with all the guest that still do smoke ?<ssssss>especially tourist -- i mean , how can the hhv , seriously control whether or not someone smoke in one of they 2860 room ?<ssssss>they certainly do not make you sign a waiver when you check in that say if you do , you have to pay $ 100 for the fumigation , or anything like that -- that many hotel do these day , at least on the mainland.should of check before bedtime -lrb- very , very late -rrb- -- but the sheet and bed linen reek of smoke too .<ssssss>we be both too tired to do anything about it and make do .<ssssss>keep in mind that these be hilton heavenly bed -lrb- i think that be what they call they -rrb- and they use down comforter in white , high thread-count duvet .<ssssss>with the window open , and temp drop down into the mid-60 's , i find it much , much too hot to sleep under the thick duvet .<ssssss>and there be no top sheet to slip under .<ssssss>i use my sarong as a sheet and we turn the air on high and cold the next 3 night .<ssssss>with the window open , there be a lot of noise from below , too .<ssssss>all be acceptable except for the back-up beeep , beeep , beeep of delivery vehicle or ????<ssssss>i begin use ear plug on night like these several trip ago and find they to be of great use , again , in this case .<ssssss>also , the air-conditioning , when on high , be quite noisy and the ear-plug come in handy -lrb- best , most comfortable , in my opinion , be the orange foam one make by 3m , model 1100 .<ssssss>cheap , too -rrb- next morning , we make sure to have house-keeping change the bed linen -- ahhh , wonderfully fresh that next night ... so , as hilton gold and guest , we receive free continental breakfast each morning , too , available at 3 restaurant -- tapa cafe , tropic beach cafe , or rainbow lanaus .<ssssss>my friend enjoy she very , very early breakfast at the tapa cafe , while i do 2 day at the tropics beach cafe and find it to be quite nice -- styrofoam coffee cup that you can refill on you way out and take a coffee to go at no extra charge be a real plus !<ssssss>food be typical cold buffet -- roll , toast , bagel , cereal , milk , juice , yogurt , fresh fruit .<ssssss>all be fresh and very good .<ssssss>by the 3rd morning , i want egg , though , and have hear we could upgrade to the hot buffet at the rainbow lanai for $ 5 .<ssssss>wonderful !<ssssss>make to order omelet , pancake with coconut syrup , meat , etc , etc , etc , as well as all the cold choice and more .<ssssss>although , i think the fresh pineapple slice at the rainbow lania be not as fresh at the tropics cafe .<ssssss>both of we have breakfast there on we last day , along with several other of she conference attendee .<ssssss>come to find out , the hot buffet go for more than $ 20 a person and the cold be about $ 13 -lrb- or more ? -rrb-<ssssss>per person .<ssssss>wow .<ssssss>if i be pay for it , i would not have be eat there ... do not have any other meal or drink at the hhv .<ssssss>they have a abc store right on premise -lrb- rainbow shop area -rrb- and the whaler 's cove general store on the side by the al ` ili tower and diamond head tower be a abc in disguise , with all the same price and much of the same stuff.pools be gorgeous -- the pool near the tapa tower , while kind of expose to all passer by , be actually more calm and quiet than the great pool where there be a lot of child .<ssssss>although there be no jacuzzi/hot tub anywhere we could find ... we hear the kalia tower pool have a jacuzzi/hot tub -- but you have to be use the over-priced madera spa in order to use it.i say overpriced madera spa because a 50 minute massage be advertise at $ 135 -- but that be not include the 4 % tax and 18 % sur charge , which be suppose to include the gratuity and bring the total to $ 164.70 .<ssssss>i have yet to meet any masseuse worth that price .<ssssss>happily , we discoverd the hale koa hotel , right next door .<ssssss>this be a military hotel ; you must be active or retired u.s. military to stay there .<ssssss>but , you can call they and book a massage with they -- you do not have to be military !<ssssss>all they have available be 30 minute -- for $ 35 -- in a cabana by the pool .<ssssss>my only complaint be that it be not long enough !<ssssss>if i have know sooner , i would have book a hour for $ 65 or 90-minute -- yes , 90 blissful minute -- for $ 85 !<ssssss>ok , so i do not get a fancy robe and slipper , but the young lady concentrate on my back , neck , and shoulder -- just as i have ask -- and i walk out of there feel wonderful and well , smug , have save myself at least $ 100 compare to the hhv price !<ssssss>can not say if the hhv nickle and dime we for anything -- we do not use the coffee maker or drink anything , not even the bottled water , in the room .<ssssss>find out that we have get a special rate of $ 149 a night , and both of we have free breakfast -- despite all the problem with the smoke-smelling room -lrb- s -rrb- -- i have to admit it be a pretty good deal for waikikus .<ssssss>the hhv beach location be wonderful , and while it be at the end of the beach , nothing be too far of a walk .<ssssss>the public bus be only $ 2 if you foot do get tire , and believe it or not , we find taxi to be quite the bargain , actually - quicker than the bus and only $ 3-5 each , for 2 , depend on where you be go along waikiki beach area ... would i stay at the hhv again ?<ssssss>maybe .<ssssss>i would be more assertive if i get a wonderful room and have the smokey problem again , however .<ssssss>and , i have to be honest with my reader -- if you be still with I this far .<ssssss>honolulu/waikiki be not my style of vacation .<ssssss>so my attitude towards the hilton hawaiian village be probably go to reflect that a bit .<ssssss>it be a huge resort , in a big town -lrb- kind of like a las vegas with a beach -rrb- .<ssssss>for the right price , if this be you style of vacation -- huge resort , lot of restaurant to choose from , multiple pool and thing for the kid to do , shop , and more shop -- the hhv be probably go to be great for you .<ssssss>if you be look for peace , quiet , relaxation , lounge , privacy -- you should probably look elsewhere .<ssssss>you can see from my other review that i much prefer kauaus , and even mauus , over honolulu .<ssssss>but , that be not the fault of the hhv .<ssssss>p.s. you can also use the hale koa bar -- it be down by the beach and pool , there .<ssssss>they drink be less expensive , they do not skimp on the pour , and they make a mighty fine mai tai !<ssssss>
4 5 3 3 2 4 -1 4		nice stay and good value central location convenient to the subway , very large room and no problem with the staff or service .<ssssss>bed be a bit small for two and the cleanliness be only average .<ssssss>room be locate on a courtyard and very quiet with a small balcony that would have be great except it lack any seating .<ssssss>nice winebar on the first floor in the courtyard be a thoroughly enjoyable experience with excellent wine and service .<ssssss>all in all a good deal and recommend .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 3 2 4 4		not very good , but not very bad my husband and i stay there for one night after a cruise and it be not what we expect .<ssssss>the room be definately run down .<ssssss>when i sit on the couch i think that i be go to fall through to the floor .<ssssss>another thing , the main reason that i choose the place be because the description say that there be a pool and whirlpool .<ssssss>there be , but unfortunately they neglect to tell we that they be not usable because of a plumbing problem .<ssssss>another problem be that none of the taxi driver know where the place be .<ssssss>its best to see if the consierge will call they for you but they be a little less than helpful .<ssssss>overall , it be not entirely bad .<ssssss>the place be clean and the shower be hot and have good water pressure .<ssssss>there be also a balcony but all that be good for be to lust over the pool and amenity over at the four season .<ssssss>i would not stay there again .<ssssss>the price be right but i plan to splurge a little the next time .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 5 3 3 -1		want to love it -- but do not .<ssssss>i be so excited to book this place , since i only read good review , but i be very disappointed in we room .<ssssss>it be very clean but end up be the size of a postage stamp , the bed literally fill the whole room .<ssssss>we pack light , only two carry-on bag each for the two of we , but there be no place to put they .<ssssss>we have to stack everything on a chair in the corner and after 6 day the cramped space get very old .<ssssss>after a couple of night we ask if there be anything else available and they say no , even though it be the middle of the week and we just see a handful of people throughout we whole stay , but since we be in beautiful puerto rico , we be not in the mood to argue .<ssssss>on the up side , the location be completely safe , we walk everywhere and stay out on the beach til midnight every night without any problem .<ssssss>we also find a great place for breakfast call kasalta , it be more like a bakery than a restaurant , but very good .<ssssss>the staff may recommend pinky 's , but we say nooo way .<ssssss>everything just feel not right about that place , and i be all about eat from vendor and kiosk , but that place be way too dirty feeling .<ssssss>so enjoy puerto rico , it be we first visit and we love it !!<ssssss>if you do not mind extremely tight quarter i guess you should stay at wind chime , but it really be not worth the money .<ssssss>
4 3 4 1 3 2 3 4		nice hotel , horrible location it describe itself as a design hotel , but there be very few touch make I think of it as that .<ssssss>the room be spacious , but staff be mediocre .<ssssss>because of a flight delay , i arrive later than i expect and they have cancel my reservation -lrb- even though i pre-paid -rrb- .<ssssss>it take almost a hour to get it resolved.my biggest problem be that the hotel be quite a distance from any restaurant or attraction .<ssssss>it be a bit of a walk to the tram and metro station , and several minute to get anywhere from there .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 3 5 4 2		decent for the price .<ssssss>.<ssssss>clean room , decent bathroom , fridge work .<ssssss>you can not really expect too much for the price .<ssssss>but overall we have a good experience there .<ssssss>just do not expect it to be much better than a motel 6 room .<ssssss>

2 3 3 3 4 1 4 -1		ok but nothing to write home about we might have be spoil by the four season in maui .<ssssss>when we island hop to oahu we stay at the hilton hawaiian .<ssssss>there be alot of people which make checking in long and crowded .<ssssss>we stay on the 26th floor with a nice city/ocean view .<ssssss>the room size be smaller compare to four season and the waikiki prince but clean .<ssssss>we stay be overall average .<ssssss>i would like to try a different hotel on we next visit to waikiki .<ssssss>
3 3 1 4 4 4 3 3		definetely not a 5 star resort !!!!!<ssssss>this be my 5th time to punta cana and i can honestly say that , although i love punta cana , this be by far the worst resort that i have ever stay at .<ssssss>my fiance and i book this trip last minute and be advise that the riu taino be a amazing place to stay at - well we beg to differ .<ssssss>this resort be grade as a 5 star but i would say it be more like a 3 star .<ssssss>let I start off by say that we be not picky traveler and we travel to various distintaion every year -lrb- sometimes twice a year -rrb- .<ssssss>so by we typing this negative review , there must have be some issue .<ssssss>room - the room be very small and the bed be two single bed so if you be larger people they be not very comfortable .<ssssss>they provide you with one small pillow and the bed be like sleep on the floor -lrb- rock hard -rrb- .<ssssss>however , they will bring you another pillow upon request .<ssssss>the washroom be okay but the shower be small .<ssssss>the bar be well stock and the liquor dispenser be always full -lrb- not that we use it since we have plenty of alcohol throughout the day -rrb- .<ssssss>the maid come in daily and do a nice job on the room and would even leave a towel decoration with flower in you room which be nice .<ssssss>we usually tip they 2-3 dollar a day.staff / food - i do not find the staff as friendly at that this resort as i do at the allegro , grand palladium , occidental grand flemenco .<ssssss>the grounds staff , maid and reception staff be usually friendly but the bar and restaurant staff do not appear to be that happy .<ssssss>it be also hard to get some sort of service in the buffet restarurant -lrb- and we be good tipper -rrb- .<ssssss>the buffet restaurant be always packed and there be no such thing as wait in line for you turn to the selection .<ssssss>many people would bud and even try to take you toast when it come out of the toaster .<ssssss>we enjoy the remainder of we meal at the sister resort riu bamboo which i enjoy very much .<ssssss>people be friendlier over there and the selection of food be better over there .<ssssss>the riu taino food be not all that great , include the specialty restaurants.pool - all i can say be that the pool at the sister resort be better .<ssssss>we spend most of we time at the bamboo resort 's pool .<ssssss>happier people over there and party galour .<ssssss>if you be interested in oil painting - buy you painting around the bamboo swim up pool bar -lrb- johnny be very nice and do amazing work -rrb- beach - the beach be amazing in punta cana no matter what resort you stay at but beach chair we scarce on we resort since people would head down to the beach in the early morning and save they .<ssssss>we would just walk down the beach until we come across some vacant one -lrb- no big deal -rrb- .<ssssss>i would recommend that if you be go to stay at a riu resort in punta cana you book the bamboo , palace macao or the riu palace -lrb- which be breathtaking - we walk through it -rrb- .<ssssss>i would not return to the riu taino resort again for numerous reason no matter how cheap it be .<ssssss>
3 3 -1 3 5 2 2 -1		unforgettable , for the wrong reason !<ssssss>book a family suite for my bday get together through phone booking .<ssssss>spacious.and that that.yes it be big , huge , spacious , i could roll ard 20 time or play hide n seek with my partner but that all that be nice abt it.whole hotel need upgrade or new refurbishments.the front desk ppl seem uninterested to check I in , appear busy and have issue with she fellow colleague hence not smile .<ssssss>-lrb- i know all this bcuz i be stand at the frontdesk ask to be check in before anyone approach I for a good 10 min .<ssssss>and 10 min be a long time -rrb- all this could probably be becuz im a local .<ssssss>not a tourist .<ssssss>so they rather prioritize the tourist bcuz the tourist be future advocator of the hotel to help spread the word abt the hotel worldwide.the corridor be seriously eerie .<ssssss>so silent that i could hear the silence .<ssssss>I and friend experience some eerie stuff in the room too .<ssssss>for the amount that i pay for a family suite 600sgd plus or minus , i think that its overpriced and nothing to be wow abt.for tourist , yes its a good location be that it be in the center of country n near orchard rd , but im sure u guy cud use the money and stay somewhr else that be worth the money .<ssssss>anyways , singapore be so small , it doesnt matter even if ur not stay in the heart of the city or the center of the country .<ssssss>frm one end of the country to the other end it only take about 1 hr + to travel by train or at a lesser time by legitimate taxis/cabs .<ssssss>venture out of the usual comfort zone and you will be surprise by what other great hotel singapore have get to offer .<ssssss>
4 4 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		almost perfect !<ssssss>this resort 's location and property be just beautiful .<ssssss>room be very clean , staff be super-friendly .<ssssss>follow be some consideration to keep in mind before decide if this be the place for you ... the location be truly secluded .<ssssss>we do not experience the traffic issue other mention , but still a good 45 min drive to honolulu/waikiki .<ssssss>ocean view be definitely distant .<ssssss>mountain view be amazing .<ssssss>be a begin golfer , makaha 's advertisement as be a course great for beginner have a lot to do with we decision to stay there .<ssssss>definitely a beautiful course , but they stack up the tee-time to the point that any beginner would be very intimidate .<ssssss>we just skip shot hole to avoid hold anyone up .<ssssss>all staff be extremely friendly , but the restaurant/lounge service be consistently awful .<ssssss>friendly be great , until the chat mean you wait 10 minute after the food arrive to get silverware , or 15 minute after dessert to get the coffee you ask for .<ssssss>lack of other dining option make this particularly tough to take .<ssssss>also , the lounge do not open until 10:30 or 11:00 , so no bloody mary with breakfast !<ssssss>the property be quite spread out , so if lot of walk be tough on you , make sure you room be near the front office/parking lot .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 1 2 -1 1		beautiful resort , horrible service my husband and i stay at ocean blue the beginning of june , this be we third time to dominican republic , we first at this resort .<ssssss>we stay in villa 5 on the second floor .<ssssss>the resort be beautiful , very large which we enjoy because we like to walk in the evening after dinner .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful , we could walk for mile .<ssssss>here be the problem we have , the lighting in the room be horrible , i could not see to read a book , my husband kill a roach on the second day .<ssssss>my husband take he own washcloth since we know from past time that if you get one washcloth you be lucky , well they take all of he washcloth and we end up with none , he call the desk to ask about it and they wait until we be in bed and then they come knock on we door at 1:00 a m in the morning , they love to play game with you .<ssssss>they never stock we fridge with beer and when my husband ask about it they say it would cost 4 dollar for a can of beer , i think this be all inclusive .<ssssss>we eat mostly at the buffet , we like the food very much but the service be horrible .<ssssss>they would never bring we a drink , they wait on everyone around we , i think we be invisible .<ssssss>we always feel like we be beg .<ssssss>in the morning they would pour a half cup of milk in you coffee .<ssssss>every other resort that we have stay at you either get you own coffee or they put a coffee pot on you table .<ssssss>mike coffee shop be the top we go there every night that be a plus.we take a banana boat ride they never tell we we would fall off , they do not care.we go on a santa domingo tour it be a very long day and very hot , we tour guide take we to the expensive shop and then leave we walk for block back to the bus by ourselves .<ssssss>i can not forget to mention people will get up early to reserve they chair and never show up for hour later and then you have some people that like to stare you down if you happen to get they first , you know who you are.they change we code to we room one day when we be at the beach .<ssssss>and last of all i can not forget to mention that somewhere between the airport and we room some of my clothes have black grease on they , they be brand new clothes when i mention this to my husband he look at he clothes and find the same thing do to he clothing .<ssssss>we have fun in spite of all that happen but we would never return to that resort again .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 1 2 2		disappointing hotel , great beach as many other have indicate , the two pool , beach and grounds be lovely .<ssssss>the food be varied and not too bad , although somewhat greasy and repetitive after a week .<ssssss>i do end up with severe stomach problem towards the end of my week there , which last several day upon my return to canada .<ssssss>i only drink bottled water , drink almost no alcohol and generally have a cast iron stomach , so it must have be the food .<ssssss>bring immodium!we book with air transat .<ssssss>be aware that prestige class mean nothing .<ssssss>you do not get any upgrade service or amenity .<ssssss>the beach towel be a scarce commodity , and there be no welcome drink .<ssssss>we room be not ready for several hour after we arrival , and we be force to either leave we luggage unattended or drag it around with us.in order to use the free casino credit , you have to spend a equivalent amount of money first .<ssssss>as other have note , the dinner reservation be often very late at night and i be tell they could not be change , even though the restaurant be empty from 8:00 pm on .<ssssss>the room fridge be not restock , even though we leave generous tip .<ssssss>the tv do not work , which be disappointing only because there be not really any place to go at night .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful in the evening , but we do not feel safe there after dark.having say all that , it be not a bad vacation , simply because the beach be so awesome .<ssssss>however , i would not return to this hotel .<ssssss>the service be generally good , except at the front desk , where it be terrible .<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 3 5 3		altamont hotel : very handy location , friendly and very helpful service the staff make ourstay at the altamont hotel a very friendly and enjoyable experience .<ssssss>the room we have be very clean , well service and have plenty of storage space for clothes .<ssssss>the bathroom be spacious , extremely clean and well look after.the altamont hotel be very well located .<ssssss>within a short walk can be find the lovely and peaceful rushcutter bay , and yet be very close to some very good bar and restaurant .<ssssss>we 10-day stay be a very pleasurable one .<ssssss>alan and he team make all visitor feel very welcome and be always happy to provide well-informed and friendly advice about make the most of the local facility and attractions.the altamont be pretty much ideal for we stay and i would be very happy to stay there again .<ssssss>
4 4 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great hotel , refreshingly different the kuâ€™Damm 101 be a refreshing change from the dreariness of standard 4-5 star hotel .<ssssss>it be a bold statement in favour of modernity -lrb- with comfort -rrb- , simplicity and style .<ssssss>the lobby be quirky with a nice round bar and a long table -lrb- at the back -rrb- for communal conversation ; modern art work be scatter throughout , so the impression be that of a art gallery , rather than you run of the mill hotel lobby .<ssssss>after you be hand out you key , which be in fact a electronic tag that you need to use even to operate the lift , you enter a hotel room which be world apart from chintz , velvet and plastic frippery .<ssssss>the floor be uncarpeted -lrb- spotless of course -rrb- and tone of grey , soft green and beige plus clever lighting , turn the room into a relaxing environment .<ssssss>bathroom be also extremely modern and efficiently design so that you have everything , but without the clutter .<ssssss>my only concern , give the design of the shower , be how the maid could possibly clean it , but it be spotless so they must have think of a way of do it !<ssssss>after a comfortable night , i take myself to they breakfast room which be located on the 7th floor , unusual but yet again refreshingly different as you be project into a airy room with view of the city .<ssssss>do not expect you run of the mill breakfast ; itâ€™s more akin to nouvelle cuisine with emphasis on vegetarian living , than a traditional hearty early morning fare .<ssssss>this may disappoint you somewhat if you be not into fresh fruit and yoghurt and prefer instead bacon and egg -lrb- you have a choice of egg , but no bacon ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>as this hotel make a statement you either love it to bit , which i do , or possibly hate .<ssssss>if you be into leather armchair , flock wallpaper , knick-knack and victoriana you shouldnâ€™t even think of this place ; if you favour instead a more contemporary life style and a change from dreary business hotel , go for it and you will be hook for ever .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 3 1 1 1		w stand for worst -- beware !!<ssssss>if you want to stay at a hotel w / rude staff , a lousy breakfast , no pool and terrible beach access this be you place .<ssssss>i have to re-read the positive review for this hotel to make sure that it be the same place .<ssssss>how in the world this hotel be under the w brand name be a complete mystery , but do not expect to have anything -lrb- e.g. room , service , and ammenity -rrb- remotely similar to any other w hotel .<ssssss>the sign may have be there : spg transfer you to a completely different number for only this hotel .<ssssss>apparently , the rumor be that the restaurant/lounge be a happen spot , but there be no sign of it when we stay there , especially when they turn the light on before midnight .<ssssss>we only stay one night , but definitely long enough of a stay to thank we star that we be move on to another hotel on the big island .<ssssss>i could give example of the staff lie to we , crummy service , walk through a parking lot to the â€œbeachâ€ ?<ssssss>-lrb- a minuscule strip of sand which can , on a good day , maybe accommodate 12 people -rrb- , but suffice it to say that if we stay there any longer it would have ruin we vacation .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 5 5 -1 -1		a nice surprise .<ssssss>front of hotel<ssssss>
3 2 5 3 3 1 2 -1		a mixed reaction we arrive on new year day in the evening .<ssssss>we leave we cab and walk into a empty lobby .<ssssss>we be tell to take the elevator , walk past the casino , over a skywalk to the other building where we be tell we would find the hotel 's desk .<ssssss>the desk turn out to be a banquet table in a hall .<ssssss>it be not a aspicious start .<ssssss>once we check in , we be assign a room and have to walk back over the skywalk , past the casino to the elevator , haul we carry-on and coat .<ssssss>my husband say you only have one chance to make a good impression and this hotel blow it !<ssssss>we have a remodeled room , one with the closet in the bathroom , which seem unusual .<ssssss>we room itself be beautiful with a great view .<ssssss>but put one 's clothes in the same area as the shower seem very odd .<ssssss>we eat at the sushi bar and at the italian cafe and be please with the food and service .<ssssss>after the first evening we rarely see people in the hall or cafe .<ssssss>it be difficult to feel that we be at a nice resort -- there be absolutley no resort feel to the place .<ssssss>walk time and again into the empty first floor lobby be just not pleasant !<ssssss>we major gripe be with the concierge .<ssssss>we call and ask for restaurant recommendation .<ssssss>we be tell that ____ -lrb- home of the pina colada -rrb- be great !<ssssss>we go and be serve food which appear to we to have be cook much earlier in the day .<ssssss>the next day we call the concierge again and ask for further recommendation .<ssssss>we be give the name of the same place .<ssssss>try to get something different we ask the concierge for another suggestion .<ssssss>we be tell she be busy at the moment and would call we back .<ssssss>she never do , although we wait .<ssssss>so , we go to marmalade in old town san juan and be delighted .<ssssss>the call back from the concierge never come , but we do not care .<ssssss>we go to marmalade the next night too !<ssssss>all in all , i do not think that this hotel give good value for the money .<ssssss>and this be the first time i have ever give a hotel a less than glowing recommendation on this forum .<ssssss>

1 2 3 5 4 2 2 -1		i wish i have book at the westin instead my husband and i be frequent guest of starwood property , in fact they be we preferred hotel .<ssssss>we typically stay at westin 's but want to give the w hotel a try because we think it would be a better , swankier hotel .<ssssss>while we dinner at earth ocean be delicious , we be very disappoint by several thing .<ssssss>the front desk and concierge be down right rude and not at all helpful .<ssssss>we feel as though they do not want to be bother by a hotel guest.the workout facility at the hotel , in short , be downright awful .<ssssss>a hotel of this caliber can not have such poor equipment in such a cramped , depressing space and expect people to believe this be a luxury hotel .<ssssss>imagine a guest room with the furniture remove and then replace with broken , out date exercise equipment .<ssssss>thankfully we have a friend in town who give we pass to the washington athletic club -- which be amazing .<ssssss>we be also disappoint to discover that the w do not provide a in-room coffee pot .<ssssss>this seem like such a standard thing these day .<ssssss>why do not they have one at this hotel?another thing that bother we be the lack of lighting in the hallway .<ssssss>we actually laugh when we try to get into we room b/c we could not see the card reader on we door .<ssssss>there be hip , and then there be just plain stupid .<ssssss>finally , we request and receive a room on one of the non-smoking floor .<ssssss>one of the other patron on the floor ignore the hotel ' rule and smoke in they room four out of the five day we be there -lrb- we assume they check out before we -rrb- .<ssssss>we call guest service the first day , no longer able to tolerate the smell in we room , and be tell something would be say to they or they would be ask to move to the smoking floor .<ssssss>they be not speak to .<ssssss>after call guest service again on the third day they tell we they would move we to a different room ... i could not understand why we would be inconvenience instead of those who be not comply with the rule of the hotel .<ssssss>it be clear that they never say anything to the guest who be smoking b/c it do not stop .<ssssss>we give up and breathe in the smoke for the rest of we stay .<ssssss>give that the price to stay at the w seattle and the westin seattle be virtually the same , and the amenty at the westin be so much better ; we will never stay at the w seattle again .<ssssss>i wish i have book the westin .<ssssss>
1 1 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		extremely disappointing we have just return from nh grand hotel krasnapolsky after spend 5 day there .<ssssss>we e-mail ahead of we arrival request a non-smoking room on a high floor .<ssssss>we arrive to find that they have no record of we booking , we show they we internet confirmation and we be duly check in .<ssssss>we leave we bag in we room and go out .<ssssss>we return later in the day tofind we room smell of tobacco smoke .<ssssss>we open the window and it seem to clear .<ssssss>we have read on this board that the heating could only be leave on by place the room key card in a slot in the room .<ssssss>however , we find this not to be the case .<ssssss>there be plenty of dangerously hot water and fantastic water pressure .<ssssss>later that night we return to the hotel bar , which be extremely busy and have a good atmosphere .<ssssss>unfortunatley we could not stay there as just about all of the guest be smoking and the bar be so full of smoke that visibility be poor !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>i can only think that this chain smoking be a continental thing as in england you have to check that smoking be permit and in which area .<ssssss>in every bar and restaurant in amsterdam , everybody smoke .<ssssss>the hotel reception staff be unsympathetic when tell that even though we be on a non smoking floor , everyone be smoking .<ssssss>as soon as you walk into the hotel you could smell smoke and probably smoke five of those cigarette and/or cigar before get to the lift .<ssssss>in every day situation at home we come across smoker in bar and restuarant and cafe and it be never a problem .<ssssss>in amsterdam it be totally intolerable .<ssssss>on the plus side the hotel be very well situated and all major aea of interest be easily accessible from there .<ssssss>the room be comfortable and clean .<ssssss>however , we expect better facility and level of service in a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>the hotel look jade and in need of a overhaul .<ssssss>it look as though it have not be upgrade at all in the seven year since we last stay there .<ssssss>we find that the bar price be almost double to the same drink serve in bar outside .<ssssss>we also have to pay again forour room on departure as they claim not to have be pay by the tour company despite show they we receipt state payment make some 9 week earlier .<ssssss>a matter now have to be resove by we credit card company .<ssssss>they have a attitiude that all guest be transitional and will be go in a few day .<ssssss>there be far nicer hotel in amsterdam with good view and reflective of 2006 .<ssssss>we certainly would not stay here again and have we known prior to departure that we be have to pay again , we would have stay somewhere else.so if you want the comfort and service of a 5 star hotel , do not choose this one .<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 4 5 2 -1		convenient localtion , clean room , bizarre experience with the lobby concierge we check in to the hilton on a tuesday night for a two night stay .<ssssss>after read some previous review we be not expect much , but we be stay for free on hilton honor point , and you can not complain much when it be free .<ssssss>check-in be efficient and pleasant , with we reservation in order.our king room be very clean , much larger than expect , and quite comfortable .<ssssss>as other review have note , it be unfortunate that there be no mini-fridge .<ssssss>there be a coffee maker and coffee be supplied.the bathroom be clean and supply with crabtree and evelyn toiletries .<ssssss>the towel be generic hotel towel , decent size but nothing special .<ssssss>it have one of those bow shower rod so the curtain do not stick to you -- a very nice feature that many hotel seem to be adopting.the bed be quite comfortable .<ssssss>the room also have a desk and comfortable upholstered chair with ottoman .<ssssss>the view out the window be basically the back of the hotel on the other side of the block , although it be very quiet and we hear no street noise at all.our first morning we could only get lukewarm water out of the shower .<ssssss>we call the front desk who say they have just turn the temperature up on the boiler , to wait about ten minute and there should be hot water .<ssssss>they call back ten minute later to ask if we now have hot water , and offer to move we to another room that they have check and do have hot water if we want .<ssssss>by this time the water be warm enough to take a shower in -- not hot , but acceptable for a quick shower , so we opt to keep that room rather than pack up .<ssssss>we do not experience the same problem the follow morning and have steamy hot water .<ssssss>the fact that the front desk call back to verify the water be heat up and offer to move we to a room with verify hot water give they two major thumb up.we have the breakfast buffet in the lobby restaurant both morning .<ssssss>service be generally adequate , and the food be varied and good.the location be perfect , a easy walk to fisherman wharf or north beach .<ssssss>there be a up store half a block away if you need to ship thing home.our second night there we want to go to a japanese steakhouse in japantown .<ssssss>we ask the lobby concierge if he could book we someplace .<ssssss>he seem to be completely unfamiliar with what a japanese steakhouse be , and keep try to steer we to korean , chinese , and sushi place .<ssssss>i try to explain that we be look for a benihana type of place , and he just do not understand what i be refer to .<ssssss>i finally pull out my blackberry and find one on my own .<ssssss>i think it be absurd and quite puzzling that a concierge in a fairly large tourist hotel in a major city do not know what a japanese steakhouse be , and seem to have never hear of the chain restaurant benihana .<ssssss>although there be a few minor inconvenience as mention above , we feel that overall the staff be truly try to give they guest a pleasant stay , and we would return here and recommend it .<ssssss>this hotel be certainly worth a slightly discounted rack rate .<ssssss>

1 1 1 3 4 2 3 -1		what a mistake !<ssssss>stay at this hotel with some friend from aug. 10 until aug 18 .<ssssss>my review be base upon 16 previous vacation to punta cana and comparison to other hotel with similar ta rankings.first , let I say that i can see why other have rave about this place .<ssssss>the concept be good with two large pool , a snack bar at the beach , a centrally located buffet , a restaurant row , and a active lobby bar with entertainment .<ssssss>it be the execution of the concept and lack of management presence , in my opinion , that be sorely lacking.we all opt for elite club hope for a higher standard of service .<ssssss>do not waste you money.the building and grounds be sterile and boring compare to other punta cana property .<ssssss>this be , by far , the least attractive hotel that i have booked.check in be neither fast nor efficient even though we be the only two room check in at the time .<ssssss>however , when we get we room card , as if by magic , a young man appear , to inform we that we have a 9:30 be appointment the follow morning to confirm we transfer back to the airport .<ssssss>obviously , it be a deceptive way to get you to go to a time share presentation .<ssssss>we politely decline , but he be very persistant .<ssssss>i know that everyone have a job to do , but could not the hotel give guest a moment to settle in before they start the high pressure sale pitch ?<ssssss>very annoying!however , my attitude be to go with the flow , do not let the little thing bother you , and enjoy a vacation in paradise .<ssssss>right ?<ssssss>... if only.it take a hour a half and several phone call for we bag to arrive .<ssssss>i get a call a few minute later inform I that there be a problem with we voucher .<ssssss>i go back to reception only to be tell that they be sorry , the voucher be ok.the second day the safe break .<ssssss>a repairman come promptly and fix it .<ssssss>the next day it break again .<ssssss>after that , we do not bother .<ssssss>the safe repairman be very busy people .<ssssss>i see they with they black briefcase everywhere and often .<ssssss>if only management could be as visable.our houskeeper be fantastic .<ssssss>they coul not do enough and have a wonderful spirit .<ssssss>we tip they gladly and often .<ssssss>thank goodness for houskeep because ... it be rain one night so we decide to order room service .<ssssss>when i complete the order , i ask for two beer .<ssssss>i be inform that the only way to get beer be to go to a bar and get it yourself .<ssssss>i explain that it be rain and i do not feel like go to a bar .<ssssss>we be in villa 6 , the farthest from any bar .<ssssss>i be tell , sorry , that be hotel policy huh ?<ssssss>i pay for elite club which include 24 hour room service and i could not get a beer bring to my room .<ssssss>the maid be kind enough to give we a few extra beers.my friend go to the beach for towel on monday and be inform that there would be no towel until tuesday .<ssssss>not a big deal , but after a while the little thing add up.my friend 's room be freezing .<ssssss>my room , in the same building be a sauna .<ssssss>after three day of try to get it fix , we be offer another room.the buffet restaurant for we be a glorified cafeteria .<ssssss>the service be hit or miss .<ssssss>the food be mediocre at best , and i feel queasy for a few hour after every meal there .<ssssss>we have one good meal and one bad one at the italian restaurant and a average dinner at route 66 .<ssssss>the a la carte restaurant be small and usually crowd .<ssssss>it be the opinion of everyone in my party that this design be to encourage guest to eat at the buffet which be cheaper for the hotel .<ssssss>the special dinner , on the beach , which be a perk of the elite club , be forgettable .<ssssss>fortunately , we have a car and be able to take meal outside of the property.we want to play golf at white sand , but one look at the golf course and it be obvious that it be not well maintain .<ssssss>we play a cocotal instead.there be no single thing that i can point to that make this hotel so bad , but rather a overwhelming amount of little thing that can be easily manage .<ssssss>a note to management : the hospitality business do not run on automatic pilot .<ssssss>get out from behind you desk and do a little supervise ... especially in the restaurants.i purposly wait a week to write this review to avoid shooting from the hip .<ssssss>even after a week , my feeling be that i would not go back even if they pay I .<ssssss>however , one bad experience do not change my love for travel to punta cana .<ssssss>i will be back in november ... just not at ocean blah .<ssssss>

4 3 4 5 5 2 2 -1		recommend we have just return from we stay at the belvedere - there be four of we -lrb- female -rrb- and we share a room with 2 double to save money .<ssssss>we room be high up which cut out a lot of noise , and we be in one of the refurbish room -lrb- we call ahead to request this -rrb- .<ssssss>room be decent size , the bathroom be scale for small people but do the trick .<ssssss>kitchenette be very handy .<ssssss>room be clean , although we have to request extra towel daily - despite be book in as a room for 4 people .<ssssss>ditto the coffee .<ssssss>gym be better than the photo showed.the most impressive thing about the hotel be the location : just a couple of block away from time square and around the corner from a great little diner call the olympic - fully recommend breakfast there .<ssssss>only complaint i could make be that one of the bellboy have a stinking attitude - we tip he $ 4 for store 6 bag and he stand count it in front of we , look disgusted and walk off without even open the door so we could bring they out to the cab.would stay again .<ssssss>
3 5 3 5 2 5 -1 4		nice hotel great location i be very concerned about stay here after i read the other review .<ssssss>i be happy with this hotel , the front desk staff be very helpful .<ssssss>i be upgrade to a 2 level suite .<ssssss>there be some noise from the outside but that what you should expect on bourbon .<ssssss>the room be pretty clean but housekeeping seem unmotivated .<ssssss>the room be very ornate with gold trim mirror furniture .<ssssss>the tv be old and seem out of place .<ssssss>i do not try the hotel food .<ssssss>the price be right for this hotel .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 3 3 5		excellent location it be right across the road from santa novelli train station withing 10 minute walk to all the major attractions.we have a 1st floor room which be very clean very large .<ssssss>the only downside be that the street noise be very audible from the room which be very noisy.the staff be ok , but not very welcoming.they have six interent terminal for free use , which be a add bonus.i would recommend this hotel to everyone .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 2 3 3		not the best value in town but they try to put thing in perspective , barcelona seem to attract several hotel that go out of they way to be hip and cool .<ssssss>granado 83 be no exception .<ssssss>the hotel be well located , on a relatively quiet street that have good access to the centre of town and nearby restaurant , however on the back side of the hotel be the school yard of a adjacent school .<ssssss>if you rise early the noise from the kid play will not be a issue though.the room of the hotel be quite small but it be the simple detail that the hotel have have problem with such as the absence of a comfortable pillow ; bed that be very firm ; the absence of a second blanket for cold evening and most disturbing of all the fact that they light switch be remarkably complicate .<ssssss>yes , that be right , they light switch !<ssssss>each with 7 or 8 button both my partner and i be unable to do basic thing like head to the bathroom in the middle of the night without fully illuminate the entire room , when we desire be to simply turn on the bathroom light.the pricing be a tad steep too .<ssssss>at 200 euro a night without much of a option to check-out late , we do not receive the best value .<ssssss>the front desk staff try to be helpful but it seem that they know little about the city and have to consult the internet with each question pose .<ssssss>i be even send several block away to have a massage while a wonderful massage be to be have at a spa just 4 meter from the hotel.anyway , if you be on you way to barcelona then pick something else unless of course they be willing to give you a break on pricing etc. .<ssssss>
3 4 3 2 4 4 -1 5		make sure you rent a car .<ssssss>shuttle service not dependable i attend a convention in phoenix and since i could not get hotel reservation downtown near the convention center , i contact this hotel because it be recommend on the convention website .<ssssss>the description include the information that the hotel have a shuttle to the convention center .<ssssss>i contact the hotel and before i make my reservation , i ask if they shuttlel run regulaly to and from the convention center .<ssssss>they say yes so i book a room.when i arrive , i inquire as to the shuttle schedule and they tell I i have to make a reservation to get a ride .<ssssss>i need to get to the site by 7:30 but the shuttle that hold 6 people be completely book by other ` conventioneer ' and i could not get a reservation to leave the hotel unti 8:30 !<ssssss>the shuttle service be not adequate nor be it flexible .<ssssss>one afternoon , the shuttle be not schedule to operate because the driver have to unload a tourist bus.there 's also not much shopping around the hotel so you need a car if you be go to stay here.the room be clean and have a microwave and small refrigerator and people who work here be generally helpful .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 4 1 1 -1		not so great we recently take a group of 30 people to puerto rico and stay at the hilton caribe for we last two night on the island .<ssssss>the booking process go smoothly , but the morning of check in be when the bad customer service begin .<ssssss>from the moment i call to confirm we check - in , to the moment we leave , none of we group have good report for they worker .<ssssss>most be just unhelpful and some be just snide .<ssssss>i do have a run in with a pleasant clerk , one helpful valet guy , and the consierge that be more than willing to help I , but as for the rest of the time we feel as if they be do we a favor by let we stay there .<ssssss>i would hope that when you pay any amount of money for a service , you would be treat like you be pay for a service instead of feeling like a unwanted house guest that be in for the weekend .<ssssss>the grounds of the hotel be beautiful and very convenient .<ssssss>the only comment on the food be to be prepare to spend more than you bargain for because everything be a extra cost .<ssssss>even the complementary water that most hotel -lrb- even cheap one -rrb- give to you in the room have a hidden cost of $ 7.00 .<ssssss>i personally do not like to feel as though i be be trick into spend my money ; if i be prepared or i feel as though i be get something for my money then i have no problem hand it over .<ssssss>all in all i would rather pay a lot more money for a hotel that pretend to like they guest then save a couple dollar .<ssssss>
4 5 2 4 5 3 3 2		it be what it be my wife and i stay at the hotel from 1/12 to 1/19 .<ssssss>while the room be subpar , and beef a little odd , everything else be good to great .<ssssss>the hotel be 80 % non-american , mostly canadian , german , british , and french .<ssssss>funny thing about that be it seem only american have any stomach issue .<ssssss>we become friend with 5 other american couple and each of they need to take some pepto bismo .<ssssss>the italian couple , the polish couple , the french couple and the canadian never have any stomach problem .<ssssss>maybe american just have weak stomach .<ssssss>that be say ... .<ssssss>the beach and the pool be excellent and the pool bartender enrique be great !<ssssss>always in a good mood and willing to try to make you drink the way you want it .<ssssss>the same can not be say of the bartender at the calypso bar , -lrb- they spend much of they time hit on the lady at the resort -rrb- .<ssssss>team animation be fantastic .<ssssss>funny and energenic ... always plan something for you to do .<ssssss>beach soccer , bocchia , volleyball , aerobics , dance , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>as for the foodthe breakfast be simply delicious ... .<ssssss>egg , bacon , crepe , yogurt , fresh fruit ... .<ssssss>so much to choose from ... lunch be also good as long as you stay away from anything with beef ... if have a funny texture and spice to it .<ssssss>the chicken by the pool be awesome.dinners be good , nothing special .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but definitely edible .<ssssss>the pool and the beach be keep very clean .<ssssss>for the price i pay it be well worth it .<ssssss>please note it be more like a 3.5 star hotel than 4 star , and they have only draught beer .<ssssss>do yourself a favor and bring a large insulate mug .<ssssss>they serve 10 oz plastic cup at the beach and pool area<ssssss>
3 2 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		typical big chain hotel the hyatt phoenix be a typical big chain hotel , mean clean , comfortable , and cold , but a good site for a large meeting -lrb- the reason i stay there -rrb- .<ssssss>comfortable bed -lrb- which for I mean very firm -rrb- , very nice staff , do not experience the hallway noise or noise from neighbor room other do .<ssssss>pleasant but very small pool and workout area .<ssssss>convenient to the convention center , arena , baseball stadium , and symphony hall , but except for those thing downtown phoenix be deadly dull -lrb- even compare to indianapolis -rrb- with little in the way of restauarant , retail , or street activity at night or on weekend .<ssssss>not a bad place to stay , but i would have no reason to stay there unless downtown for a meeting or business downtown .<ssssss>
2 3 1 5 3 3 3 3		definitely overrate after see so many wonderful review on this website , i be determine to book a room there for a three-day stay in amsterdam .<ssssss>i contact the hotel directly , and be offer 2 room -lrb- one for my husband and I , the other - for my 17 20 year old -rrb- .<ssssss>two day before arrival , i e-mail the hotel to reconfirm the reservation , and specifically ask for 2 room face the canal .<ssssss>yes , the location of the hotel be superb , and a little family-run restaurant on the corner just outside be wonderful , but the room ... please !<ssssss>we be give 2 room , neither one of which face the street .<ssssss>the term tiny do not even begin to describe it , and the fact that it be july - hot , humid - and the room have no air conditioning ... the staff give we one small desk fan per room , and we ask for another one because it be sheer hell sleeping in a stuffy , airless room , but be politely tell that there be no more fan leave to lend .<ssssss>i repeatedly ask to be move to another room , but be tell that the hotel be fully book and my request could not be honor .<ssssss>in short , we stay at hotel estherea be disappointing , but walk the street of this beautiful city , see all the wonderful sight , take canal ride - it all make up for we not-so-wonderful accommodation .<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 3 2 3 -1		pleasantly surprise we spend a night here between international flights.i be not expect a great deal from a airport hotel but be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>it be literally minute from lax , probably one of the closest hotel and with acomp shuttle bus that go very frequently .<ssssss>room large , quiet , clean and comfortable .<ssssss>the starbuck in the lobby be a genius idea and much appreciated!only criticism be that there be only one person on reception when we check in which be somewhat annoying .<ssssss>have more reception staff : traveller relish quick check in and out !<ssssss>otherwise full point !<ssssss>

1 2 3 3 3 1 1 1		stay away !<ssssss>it be not often i would feel inclined to write a bad review .<ssssss>sometimes -lrb- like this time -rrb- i will actually wait a while before write a review in order to gain perspective and make sure i be not just be totally negative without warrant.anyway , arrive at the hotel on the 15th , with my voucher for five night stay ready and wait , to be tell there be not a room book .<ssssss>my voucher say otherwise and after about 10 stressful minute i be tell they would have a room for we and there be a fault with they reservation system .<ssssss>no apology.the room be small , not much room to move around the bed and there be very little storage space .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny and there be no shelf on which to place toiletries , so end up have to just leave we wash bag on the floor next to the toilet .<ssssss>nice.like the sheraton in chicago -lrb- see my other review -rrb- which we would just travel from , the courtyard have a overpriced bottle of water wait to be consume by the unsuspecting guest .<ssssss>however when a bill be slip under we door for water we do not consume -lrb- we would be buy water from the nearby 7-11 for a lot less ! -rrb-<ssssss>, i let the manager know all about it .<ssssss>the water be teken off the bill , but no apology be forthcoming.the broadband signal be virtually non-existant , so there be not much point in even try to browse.on the positive side though be the bed .<ssssss>very comfortable !<ssssss>even more comfortable than the bed the sheraton chain make such a big fuss about .<ssssss>the room , while small be clean , however when we check into we room , there be a shower curtain on the floor behind the toilet -lrb- presumably it have be replace by the new one hang on the rail -rrb- .<ssssss>another goodish thing be the location .<ssssss>4 min walk to boston common , in the heart of the theater district and chinatown literally around the corner .<ssssss>newbury street be about 15 min walk away .<ssssss>you could even walk to fenway park from here without break a sweat .<ssssss>that say , at night it can be intimidate .<ssssss>on the morning we check out , there be a report on the news about a murder on the corner about 100m from the hotel !<ssssss>
2 2 5 5 5 5 2 4		love and dislike there be 10 of we celebrate two 60th birthday .<ssssss>we love the hotel-very clean and the room be spacious .<ssssss>there be a lot of walk involve and i do not recommend this resort for people with disability or people that can not walk long distance because there be no bench to rest on .<ssssss>the tram do not run every 20 minute as advertise .<ssssss>sometimes it would take a hour for one to arrive .<ssssss>the restaurant be fabulous .<ssssss>the buffet be very good because they have something for everyone .<ssssss>the grounds be immaculate and there be always someone to help you find whatever you be look for .<ssssss>the casino be a bit of a disappointment , they only have 5 cent machine and only about 25 of those .<ssssss>the pool be great .<ssssss>some of they have step to get into the pool and some have just ladder .<ssssss>the swim up bar be nice .<ssssss>you have to get to the pool early to lay down you towel if you want shade .<ssssss>if you be fit and enjoy lot of walk this be the place to go .<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 4 2 1 2		sub-standard for a peninsula hotel at first glance upon enter the lobby the evening i check in , i think this would be equivalent to both hong kong and the beverly hill property in term of service/quality and overall impression .<ssssss>i be wrong .<ssssss>service quality be just not up to standard of they other property .<ssssss>no one seem willing to go out of they way to help or assist .<ssssss>the thing i love about the other peninsula property i have stay at be that they almost anticipate my need before i even ask .<ssssss>this be not the case at this property .<ssssss>the standard room be also very small .<ssssss>free bottled water come once a day in the evening around 8pm - and they be small half bottle so you ould wait all day to have something to drink in you room again .<ssssss>one one day , i have the privacy button turn on in my room and when i come back tomy room , the maid be actually in my room clean it !<ssssss>they need better training .<ssssss>i have leave some valuable out in the room and be not happy about this .<ssssss>they wi-fi service be slow and intermittent , althought complimentary .<ssssss>the hotel be virtually empty -lrb- as be many other beij hotel at this time -rrb- and yet the hotel be unwilling to give I a upgrade -lrb- for a fee -rrb- to the club floor .<ssssss>the hotel airport transfer be sub par as well -- the greeter at the airport be disorganize and make we walk around the parking garage with they to find the car instead of keep we in a pick up spot to wait for the car to come to we .<ssssss>when it do arrive , it be a old model mercedes which compare to other hotel like the mandarin oriental or regent , be very below standard .<ssssss>i would not use they car service again for the amount of money pay -lrb- about $ 100 each way -rrb- .<ssssss>doorman be pretty god for get taxi .<ssssss>restaurant jing be a good breakfast buffet but on the expensive side - $ 40 a person .<ssssss>overall , i would not recommend this property , especially for those of you who regularly stay at peninsula hotel .<ssssss>i will stay at other luxury property on my subsequent trip to beijing .<ssssss>there be several newer property like the grand hyatt , and the grand millenium , as well as the regent .<ssssss>
2 1 2 3 3 1 1 -1		do not enjoy the suite i book a room in the suite at 1 king west for a night -lrb- may , 3 2008 -rrb- so that i could fly into toronto and not have to drive a great distance to get to my final destination.the person at the front desk be very pleasant as she deny my request to be in the new tower on a floor that would give I a nice view of the city .<ssssss>i didnâ€™t think that would be a issue give what appear to be a great number of vacant room available judge by the lack of people in the lobby and bar area.instead , after she verify that i have book my reservation through travelocity , i be give a room in the historic section of the building on the tenth floor .<ssssss>the historic part of the building be originally a bank that be build around 1906 and at some point in time convert to a hotel .<ssssss>unfortunately , even after several upgrade , it still be not desirable by todayâ€™s standard , even at one quarter of the cost at $ 212usd a night include tax .<ssssss>and buy the way , the valet parking be a additional $ 40 .<ssssss>the room that i be give be a standard suite which isnâ€™t really much of a suite at all .<ssssss>it compare very closely with any normal room in a typical three star hotel even though this be suppose to be either a four or five star hotel depend on what you read.in no way should this hotel have either a four or five star rating , at least not base on my room .<ssssss>the window be single pane , uninsulated , wooden window that should have be replace year ago .<ssssss>the paint be in need of a refreshining .<ssssss>the heater be loud but work okay .<ssssss>when i go to find the vend machine for ice and a soda , i be unpleasantly surprise to find that the only one around be locate on the twelfth floor and find they even then be not easy .<ssssss>as i mention , i be on the tenth floor , and unfortunately , due to the window and the proximity of the room to the street below , just the noise from the traffic be enough to keep I from get a well deserve night 's sleep.i have read several other review and notice a disturbing trend ... .<ssssss>those that stay in the new tower seem to enjoy they room , while those that be relegate to the historic part of the building be not at all happy with they rooms.i hope that the manager of the suite at 1 king west will read this review perhaps change they policy on place guest in the historic section of the building.my guess be that one-nighter that book through a third-party will be very unhappy!my advise be to look elsewhere for a decent hotel .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 2 5 -1		some good , some bad , mostly good !<ssssss>we be at the majestic colonial for a week , in early december 2008 .<ssssss>we be blow away by the sheer beauty of the resort , the room , the beach , the pool and the delicious food .<ssssss>the picture honestly do the place no justice , its just gorgeous .<ssssss>all of the server , bell boy , maid , etc. be totally wonderful to we during we trip .<ssssss>we take we toddler along with we , and everyone be so welcome to he , bring we high chair , blow he kiss , give he high fives , and we always hear hola baby everywhere we go .<ssssss>we , as parent , be thrill to see the staff interact with we child .<ssssss>we spend a lot of time on the beach , during which we meet denny , the beach consierge , who be very helpful , friendly and wonderful .<ssssss>we party be constantly send he back to the bar with more order for more drink .<ssssss>each time , he be more than willing to get what we need and want , and we always see he smile .<ssssss>in the buffet , we all enjoy everyone .<ssssss>we have the nicest bus boy , who name i wish i could remember .<ssssss>he tell we about how he have a son close to we son 's age , and be so helpful and polite .<ssssss>the maid barely know english , but always smile at we and say hola as we would walk by , especially to the baby .<ssssss>in every single restuarant , my son make friend who be so wonderful .<ssssss>even willing to take photo with he , i be so impressed with how kind they be to he , and that they treat he like they own son .<ssssss>the only name i remember be jinny because he spend a lot of time help we .<ssssss>i wish i remember more name becuase all of the staff be so wonderful , and i would love to thank they all personally .<ssssss>the staff in the morning at the buffet be just speldid .<ssssss>im so greatful to have meet such wonderful people.i have a few thing that really frustrate I during we stay - some day we have the coffee refill in we room , other day we didnt .<ssssss>we be there sunday-sunday and do not get a facecloth until thursday .<ssssss>we have several power outage , and one even make the ac not work for about 36 hour .<ssssss>also , one day we could not shower because the shower be not work at all .<ssssss>we have no hot , or cold water .<ssssss>when i dial down to ask about it , the front desk staff be not very helpful and basically hang up on .<ssssss>the light and ac be all hardwire so that they shut off when you leave the room , which be fine - but the alarm clock constantly would reset itself , which be a pain to we .<ssssss>perhaps that could be on a different line .<ssssss>during we stay , we be there for a wedding .<ssssss>the wedding be beautiful , and gorgeous , and the staff do a lot to make sure it be that way .<ssssss>however , due to a power outage , the reception start almost a hour and a half later than it be suppose to .<ssssss>when 11 pm come around , the night be over , even though the bridge and groom have pay for so many hour , and lose out .<ssssss>i do not think that be fair at all , especially since we be in a private area , and not cause anyone inconvience .<ssssss>the next day , there be a wedding right next to the pool , and they be still party after midnight , and someone be singing into the microphone , so it be really loud and echo through the entire resort .<ssssss>i phone to ask when it would be stop , and the front desk hang up on I .<ssssss>i continously call back as i have need a wake up call for the next day , and never do get through .<ssssss>i think that be horrible of they , and i be very angry about the wedding be so loud and allow to go so late in a public area , and be hang up on .<ssssss>i be not please with the front area staff during the entire trip .<ssssss>the one time we do have a wake up call to get up to leave for a excursion , it be 15 minute late .<ssssss>the entertainment be great , i love the show i do get to see , the bar be amazing , the music be wonderful , the vendor market be a good safe way to shop , the pool be clean , the free program be amazing .<ssssss>i do the aqua fitness class with a young man , i beleived name romeo .<ssssss>he be originally from haitus , that all i know about he .<ssssss>he be very involve with the group , have a great sense of humour and be excellent with the participant .<ssssss>i enjoy everything about the entertainment and thing that be offer to the guests.i go off the resort for the safari tour , and i would highly recomend that to anyone .<ssssss>it be worth it to see how dominican life be .<ssssss>im so thankful that i be at the majestic colonial , despite the few problem that we have , we have a great trip , we meet a lot of wonderful people , and we as a couple have a great time , as well as we son .<ssssss>we be so happy and comfortable all week , we love the food , the drink , the whole atmosphere .<ssssss>i would recomend this resort -lrb- and have already -rrb- to anyone interested in punta cana .<ssssss>my only wish be that the week go on , and on , and on .<ssssss>.<ssssss>and wasnt over already !<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 4 3 3 1		great if you get it at a good price four friend and i decide to travel here for we christmas university break .<ssssss>we book online and choose this resort because it have a 4 star rating on orbitz and be very cheap .<ssssss>we pay $ 162 -lrb- usd -rrb- a day for a 7-day vacation , include flight from seattle , wa .<ssssss>after we book it , i find all of the negative review here on tripadvisor .<ssssss>needless to say , i be very worried .<ssssss>we arrive on december 14th and stay until the 22nd .<ssssss>first off , some reviewer have a problem get to the hotel .<ssssss>it be really easy , just hire a taxi .<ssssss>it cost $ 30 usd for a trip to the resort and they all know where it be .<ssssss>do not matter how many people you cram in the taxi , and its quick and direct.upon arrival in the morning , we check in .<ssssss>there be no line in front of we , though i notice that the check-in counter be ridiculously busy in the late afternoon .<ssssss>the person help we be friendly enough , though it be hard to always understand he and he keep make fun of we .<ssssss>i think he be try to be friendly , but it be not professional .<ssssss>we also get a free drink at the check-in counter.we be place in block 3 .<ssssss>i would originally request a suite in block 9 , 10 or 11 , but they be all fill .<ssssss>block 3 be a renovate portion of the resort that overlook the ocean and pool .<ssssss>after walk around , i much preferred block 3 from anywhere else.we have the third floor .<ssssss>very high ceiling , two queen-sized bed .<ssssss>the room be large and clean , though the bathroom shower water be rarely very hot -lrb- but not cold , either ... just that medium hot that be irritating when you be cold from the pool -rrb- .<ssssss>the grounds be nice .<ssssss>the pool be big , though we spend most of the time at the beach .<ssssss>the beach be not the nicest , and its on the atlantic side of the dominican republic so its windier .<ssssss>lot of seaweed , though there be man who clean it up as it get wash ashore .<ssssss>lot of chair and hut for shade ; that be never a problem .<ssssss>you can also walk down the coast and find nicer beach .<ssssss>i would strongly suggest get a tour to saona island ... best daytrip ever and that be where you will find pristine white beach and that clear , green-blue water that you think of when you think of the caribbean.the food be good .<ssssss>all the restaurant be free except for the japanese restaurant , so we never eat there .<ssssss>we eat at the tex-mex restaurant three time , the seafood restaurant one , and the italian restaurant twice .<ssssss>for lunch , we eat at the snack bar -lrb- fries , burger , fry chicken , and random main dish -rrb- .<ssssss>breakfast , we would eat at window .<ssssss>we only eat at window once for dinner .<ssssss>the restaurant be clean and the food be good .<ssssss>we like the italian restaurant the most .<ssssss>the hotel give you reservation ticket and tell you you can only eat at one restaurant once .<ssssss>we go several time .<ssssss>sometimes they ask for a ticket , sometimes they do not .<ssssss>but they just leave the used ticket out on a desk and we grab extras.there be something like six bar .<ssssss>the drink be ok , most of the time they do not know how to mix stuff so you have to know exactly what you want .<ssssss>do not expect anything too fancy .<ssssss>if you want to get drunk , it be easy .<ssssss>just do a lot of tequila shots.the people can be very rude and pushy , or very nice .<ssssss>the sale people that come on the grounds to sell you tourist trinket be annoying and you just have to be firm and tell they you be not interested.i would strongly suggest go off the resort for excursion .<ssssss>we do a saona island trip -lrb- all day -rrb- and a atv ride -lrb- 4 hour -rrb- .<ssssss>both be totally worth it.this resort be excellent if you be get a good price .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 3 1 1 3		never again - hugely overpriced i suggest the axel hotel for some friend visit I from abroad .<ssssss>when they check into the suite , they have various comment regard the lack of think in this hotel .<ssssss>i check out they room , as i feel bad for suggest it .<ssssss>i have work for a airline for 18 year , so i have a bit of insight on all range of hotel .<ssssss>after see the place , i would not suggest that anyone pay these over-inflated price - there be many better option in barcelona at half the price.the suite have a open plan bathroom , which be nice .<ssssss>but the toilet have no door , so you have to hear everyone on the loo - unacceptable .<ssssss>the shower do not have thermostatic control , why - they cost marginally more?the wardrobe be cheap chrome , open air and ugly .<ssssss>so you be face with see you clothes and suitcase during you entire stay .<ssssss>one of the friend be on medication need refrigeration , they do not have fridge or minibar or tea coffee make facility - unacceptable .<ssssss>they have the cheapest , nastiest flat tv that stick out of the wall .<ssssss>on top of that , and yet even worse , you get a cheap samsung stereo with huge ugly speaker that hang either side of the bed .<ssssss>surely a afterthought in that orange wood colour .<ssssss>all in all , it feel like a cheap conversion with fake wood floor and substandard fitting .<ssssss>some of the lighting be interesting , though be very home-made and will date quickly.my friend return to the axel after a stay in ibiza , this time they stay in a deluxe room , which be as above , but with a bathroom with a door.they also comment that the staff be unfriendly , do not know anything about the local gay area , and be generally uninterested in they guest .<ssssss>-lrb- they could rarely get a taxi , and be not help to find one -rrb- i also notice they must use half of the power grid on light the guest hallway , it be truly painful lighting and shopping mall like design .<ssssss>though i love the bottle of chill water on every floorwhat more can i say , i will never suggest that anyone stay here .<ssssss>rl , bcn<ssssss>
2 1 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great potential but fall short great potential ; but the resort fall short of be even a four-star property .<ssssss>some very simple adjustment could bring this resort up several notch ... improve the food !<ssssss>and figure out what be wrong with the reservation system for dining and fix it !<ssssss>have some simple , fun evening activity ; like bingo with a bottle of rum for the prize .<ssssss>have it before or after the dinner hour and have it in the bar next to the casino or in the lobby .<ssssss>people would love to have something to do ; there be nothing to do around the dinner hour .<ssssss>have a mc and do a audience-involved type of show .<ssssss>the bar next to the casino be virtually empty , and could be a good place to have some type of activity , or maybe even the lobby area .<ssssss>this hotel could be great ; just put in a little effort to raise it to truly be a five star property .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 1 2 3 -1		not a pleasant stay !<ssssss>my stay be horrible .<ssssss>the door automatically slam shut and be so loud that 3-4 door down the hall will wake you up ; when showers/toilet use in other room it sound like they be in my room .<ssssss>room be dirty and need work down .<ssssss>my jewelry be steal and they would not do anything about it .<ssssss>no coffee pot available in room ; $ 8.50 for coffee each day be too much .<ssssss>wedding party in next room up late fighting each night ; hotel would not do anything .<ssssss>when concert schedule outside , restaurant would not give preference to hotel guest who want to dine .<ssssss>could not get cocktail outside without a table and not allow to bring drink from inside hotel to outside .<ssssss>fill out comment card and no one from hotel ever contact I .<ssssss>would not recommend this hotel to anyone !<ssssss>especially with the rate i be pay , $ 260.00 per night .<ssssss>

2 3 3 4 3 1 2 -1		beautiful resort , poor service , bad food first , a warn to parent travel with two child : there be no rollaway bed available in this resort -lrb- first time in my many time in the caribbean all-inclusive -rrb- .<ssssss>so you have two choice -- either share a king-size bed with one of you kid , or get a room with two full-size bed , each of they too small to accommodate two full-size adults.the resort be large , well-maintained with nice pool and beautiful beach .<ssssss>bartender be cheerful , skilled , and drink be plentiful .<ssssss>tip be appreciate , but not necessary .<ssssss>mini club for kid be apparently a lot of fun .<ssssss>some of the nightly show they put together -lrb- michael jackson , circus -rrb- be almost professional .<ssssss>during we stay , guest be mostly canadian , french , a few italian , and very few american .<ssssss>size of the resort be not a problem at all , there be all-day transportation from the main lobby to the beach with stop throughout the resort.the food range from semi-decent -lrb- italian restaurant -rrb- to below-average -lrb- french -rrb- to simply inedible -lrb- mexican -rrb- .<ssssss>in the buffet we could only handle pasta , egg , bread and fruit and vegetable .<ssssss>everything else be either bland , or greasy , or whole-fried .<ssssss>service in all a la carte restaurant be just ok , but in the buffet it be pretty terrible due to the fact that no one -lrb- i mean no one ! -rrb-<ssssss>speak any -lrb- i mean any ! -rrb-<ssssss>english .<ssssss>if you , god forbid , turn away from you half-eaten meal for a split second , the plate will disappear from you table .<ssssss>the generic wine be horrendous .<ssssss>with you eye close you will not be able to tell the red from the white , because they both smell and taste like vinegar.room service be pretty bad .<ssssss>i give the woman $ 5 we daily and she still would not clean the room till late afternoon , so if we want to return to we room before 3pm , we could not .<ssssss>it be impossible to get extra towel , or a extra bottle of water .<ssssss>a few time we could not get any fresh towel until very late afternoon , despite call to the front desk.the worst of all be the reception desk people .<ssssss>arrogant , rude and inept .<ssssss>upon arrival we have to wait 3 hour -lrb- from 2 pm to 5 pm -rrb- to get a room , despite a rather large tip .<ssssss>they would not crack a smile , or thank you .<ssssss>one night i actually witness they mock a tipsy female guest who lose she hotel bracelet .<ssssss>request and phone call be answer with such impoliteness , that you would think twice before ask they a question .<ssssss>they call it , as one of the front desk manager tell I , â€œkeeping the integrityâ€â $ ?<ssssss>br / > so , you say , it be all minor stuff , do not be petty , enjoy you vacation , but at the end of the day little thing like these prevent you from call you stay in gran bahia principe a â€œgreat vacationâ€ ?<ssssss>

4 5 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		a nice stay i like many other choose this hotel base on read so many positive review on this website .<ssssss>my opinion of this hotel mirror most of what everyone else have already state -- its a very good option for the price and location .<ssssss>i come into new york city mainly to spend a few day at the we tennis open and the hotel be only a few block away from the time square subway station on route to catch the # 7 train to flushing .<ssssss>i can not comment on eat at the belvedere as i just walk around a lot and eat at place that strike my fancy .<ssssss>my room be situate on the 17th floor and i have no problem with the elevator .<ssssss>yes , the elevator be small and can not hold more than 10 people at a time , but they be work alright and i always have a empty elevator to step into go down from the 17th floor .<ssssss>i will comment that the bathroom be tiny and the lighting be not very bright .<ssssss>the size of the bathroom be not a problem for I but i imagine if you be a portly person that the lack of space might become uncomfortable .<ssssss>all in all i will try to stay at the belvedere next year when i return to new york city for the we open .<ssssss>that my two cent .<ssssss>hope its useful to someone .<ssssss>

3 3 3 3 3 4 4 1		ok hotel - people be nice property location : centrally located - 15 minute walk from train station , duomo and central market .<ssssss>there be no elevator in the hotel and there be also a long flight of stair before you get to the reception .<ssssss>so if you have a lot of luggage or heavy luggage you should take this into account.the room we have be not very large but the ac work and we be there in october but the weather be summer-like and the ac be very necessary .<ssssss>as well , there be mosquito so we could not sleep with the window open -lrb- plus the noise some night get quite loud - we have earplug with the window close and could still hear -rrb- .<ssssss>** we be tell that florence be mosquito-y in general and that it be not a problem necessarily with this hotel.there be no internet access for guest use - but there be internet cafe nearby -lrb- 5 minute walk -rrb- .<ssssss>you will need you passport to gain internet access in italy -lrb- anti-terrorism law -rrb- .<ssssss>the bath room be small , toiletries give be very basic .<ssssss>the bathroom can emit and odor so remember to shut the door when u leave the hotel - and that seem to help a lot.all in all , the hotel be very basic -lrb- from the breakfast , room , bathroom etc. -rrb- , but the central location and helpful front desk people be great .<ssssss>i think this hotel be especially perfect for those of the mindset that the hotel be just a place to sleep in - you be not look for luxury just the basic comfort and helpful front desk personnel .<ssssss>
4 3 2 5 4 5 4 4		nice hotel , dated room stay here for a two day course , room be a little shabby , need a little update , very dark inside .<ssssss>generally pretty clean and functional though , free wi-fus internet access throughout the hotel.conference room be good , staff pretty helpful.general hotel reception and bar pretty good , if not a little pricey ... free bus to airport every 15 min at peak time .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 5 4 3 3		good hotel the metro be very central .<ssssss>empire state building , macy ` be very near and penn station and time square within easy walk distance and a subway station on the cornerwe find the hotel to be very clean -lrb- bed clothes change every day -rrb- .<ssssss>staff friendly and helpful we room -lrb- 601 -rrb- overlook a alley be a bit small .<ssssss>it be slightly noisy with extractor fan from nearby reataurant work all night .<ssssss>we own air conditioning system work well but be also rather niosy too .<ssssss>but we soon get use to it .<ssssss>the breakfast be better than we expect with a good choice and plentiful .<ssssss>overall the metro be a great hotel and we would recomend it to we friend and stay there again .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 5 5 2		pleasant stay in s.f. perfect location on the northeastern side of union square , very safe , convenient to everything , near all the best shopping and close to chinatown gate .<ssssss>everyone who work there be most pleasant , friendly , and helpful.rooms be very nice .<ssssss>the fitness center be one of the best i have ever see at a hotel .<ssssss>my only complaint be that the breakfast room be much too small , result in wait time of up to a hour for a table .<ssssss>this really throw off we plan every morning .<ssssss>they need to serve breakfast in a much larger room .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet itself be excellent , and the staff there be very very kind and friendly .<ssssss>the elevator also require quite a wait sometimes , as this be a very large hotel for only 5 or 6 elevators.overall , we really enjoy stay here , but do not pay extra for the breakfast - you will waste a lot of time in the morning wait for a table ; just eat at any of the coffee shop or diner surround the hotel .<ssssss>

1 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		nice bed - awful service i be about to come back to australia from a very long international flight and i want to stop in sydney for the night before continue my journey .<ssssss>qanta have include a piece on the â€œnewâ€?hilton sydney â€?including they relaxation suite â€?in they frequent flyer news and i think that this might be the ideal ticket for a overnight stop to unwind and relax so i call through and book they $ 650 room for the night.unfortunately for I â€?instead of unwind and relax â€?my stay at the hilton sydney have I aggravate and disgust thanks to the -- poor management of this hotel .<ssssss>it all start when my companion and i first get to the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel have a security guard in the driveway â€?that without even bother to ask we anything â€?waved we down a driveway to the hotelâ€™s underground car park instead of the valet reception area .<ssssss>this lead to we have to lug we large collection of luggage up to reception -lrb- i have just come back from six month overseas so i be definitely less than impressed .<ssssss>when i get up to the lobby i inform both reception and the concierge/bellman desk about the stuff up by they guy in the driveway , inform they that the car be in the underground car park and that the key be with the staff down they , and could they please fix up they mistake and properly valet check the car in .<ssssss>as i get reply in the affirmative from the concierge staff -lrb- check-in tell I to tell it to the concierge staff -rrb- i figure all be ok , apart from that fact that none of the staff appear to be apologetic about the fact we have be misdirect nor seem to care that much .<ssssss>i take this promise to fix it up at face word , which i be to pay for later.as to the room the furnishings be nice and the bed be comfortable , the toiletries be boutique , the shower have a rainfall head -lrb- with separate massage jet â€?although you couldnâ€™t have both on at the same time -rrb- , and the spa bath be a full-sized two person spa with a view of the city skyline .<ssssss>the thing that really ----- I off about the room though be that the tv at the end of the spa bath -lrb- which be the selling point for I because i though how relax would it be to just kick back in the spa and still catch up on the latest news -rrb- be that the damm thing wouldnâ€™t change channel with any remote in the room and be permanent stick on the god awful hotel travel channel program â€?it really suck any joy out of the experience and , as the spa bath wasnâ€™t really a very powerful one , there be much point staying in it for more than 10 minute especially since i really want to catch up on the news -lrb- that i couldnâ€™t watch -rrb- .<ssssss>one other problem with the room be that the slide panel between the lounge space and the bedroom screech like a wound banshee when open and close .<ssssss>these two thing turn a otherwise quite good mini-suite into a unimpressive experience.to top my d-e-l-i-g-h-t-f-u-l stay it take almost a hour to get the car bring up and we be leave sit around in the lounge for more than 25 minute without anyone bother to let we know what the hell be go , which be only resolve because i waylaided on of the staff to tell I why we car wasnâ€™t ready yet .<ssssss>it turn out that , despite assurance from the staff on duty that the cluster handling of we arrival at the hotel would be fix , it hadnâ€™t be , and the hotel have manage to misplace the car .<ssssss>it be extremely bloody lucky that i have a late onward flight book otherwise i would have miss my connection thanks to the god awful way this hotel be run .<ssssss>sydney hilton need to pull its sock up â€?service of this level be way below that to be expect from a 5 star hotel â€?especially when youâ€™re pay more than $ 500 a night for the privilege.my recommendation â€?stay somewhere else .<ssssss>

2 2 1 3 1 3 3 -1		gross and expensive maybe we get the one disgusting room in the hotel , but i be very surprise by the positive review list here .<ssssss>the location near the train station be convenient for we and we do not find it to be dangerous .<ssssss>we problem be the room itself .<ssssss>ours be old and nasty .<ssssss>i do not want to touch the bedspread or the carpet .<ssssss>we be on the first floor behind the reception desk , so perhaps the room upstairs be nicer .<ssssss>i think it be completely overprice and i would not stay there again .<ssssss>

1 1 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		confuse !<ssssss>i travel frequently and always check with tripadvisorbefore book a resort , which i do for melia caribe , unfortunetly i do not go past the first 5 review which rave about this place .<ssssss>the same day i return from my trip i once again check the review on tripadvisor because i could not beleive this be the same place i stay at , in fact the deeper i go into the review the more i find comment which be in line with my experience.i realize that for some people 80 degree weather and a palm tree be all they need to have a great vacation but for god sake this place be rate 5 star and it be not cheap i just do not understand how anyone can rate this place as excellent because the grounds be beautiful , which be the only positive thing.what to expect : very well stock mini bar , two bottle of water and two diet pepsi 's .<ssssss>expect to walk 15 minute to beach and 15 to lobby from center of resort , this be great exercise it will also keep you sharp for when you get back to the city as you will be share path with train , car , jeep and scooter the smell of exhaust fume will comfort you if you miss the big city.if you enjoy be in a pool with hundred of other people -lrb- february -rrb- this be the place for you.if you enjoy wake up early to reserve a hut on the beach you will love this place.if you perfect vacation be call in for restaurant reservation at 8 a.m and be tell sorry sir we be fully book by 7:15 , ah heaven on earth.the local be very friendly they be not tring to sell you time share appartment they be just there to greet you as you enter and exit the breakfast and lunch buffet , excellent way to learn spanish.check out be at 12 noon and you flight be in the evening no problem at this 5 star resort they will provide you with a fully furnished closet next to the luggage room with a shower a sink and 40 use towelsstack in the corner as a reminder of the people that shower before you , if you be one of the annoying picky traveler and ask politely they will mop the floor and remove the towel , afterwards you will have the opportunity for socialize with the other priviliged guest who will come knock on the door ask if you be do yet .<ssssss>i miss this one already and it be only a day that i ` be back home.for all you none picky traveler this place be definetly a 5 star , if you consider yourself picky stay away from this place or i can assure you that you will miss you 30 degree weather .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		good location , good value , friendly service i have one night in san francisco before a flight , and pick this hotel mainly base on its close proximity to bart powell st station -lrb- 30 minute ride to sfo -rrb- and price .<ssssss>the hotel be average .<ssssss>my 3rd floor room be a bit small and dark .<ssssss>i could hear people talk in the next room .<ssssss>but it be spotlessly clean , the 4 or 5 hotel staff i interact with be all nice and friendly , and the include breakfast be a nice touch -lrb- if a bit unnecessary give the excellent breakfast option nearby -rrb- .<ssssss>note there be no ac , but not a problem in march .<ssssss>can not ask for more for this price .<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		flawless property - but spg member should keep some thing in mind .<ssssss>it would be difficult to rate this property as 5 star only because of problem encounter as a spg gold member .<ssssss>please read on : i have book a deluxe room - which , as it turn out be in they older , heritage wing -lrb- i.e. no view , low floor -rrb- .<ssssss>i disagree with they assessment that the room be deluxe , and ask to be upgrade .<ssssss>starwood gold mean nothing to this hotel , and complimentary upgrade be out of the question .<ssssss>thus , i agree to pay for the upgrade for the first night , as long as the night on point would not incur a additional charge - i be assure that it would not .<ssssss>i pay the aud60 , and press on .<ssssss>i be surprise to find a additional aud116 on my bill at check-out .<ssssss>in fairness , they take care of it after some complain , but it should not have happen .<ssssss>they be fairly flexible with the late check-out -lrb- 4:00 pm -rrb- , and they be a congenial group - but i could not get the bad taste out of my mouth , with the condescending comment about gold member .<ssssss>they only upgrade -lrb- and cater to -rrb- platinum member .<ssssss>

2 1 3 -1 4 -1 4 -1		acceptable but not # 2 in new york stay on the basis of tripadvisor review in early december .<ssssss>as other have say , the hotel be very well positioned , the staff be friendly and helpful and the main bedroom large and clean .<ssssss>the bathroom be rather small ; the kitchen be fairly useful but could be better employ .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable and the furniture and carpet ok , but show wear and tear .<ssssss>the view be unexciting .<ssssss>there be a very small public area.the hotel be perfectly adequate for we need but it be not first class .<ssssss>in my view , it should only enjoy its premier position in tripadvisorâ€™s hall of fame by charge relatively low rate .<ssssss>we however pay Â£322 -lrb- about $ 550 -rrb- on average per night via expedia - which be about twice the rate that i think the hotel be worth .<ssssss>it be of course christmas but i believe the room be still significantly overprice .<ssssss>at half this price , the affinia dumont would warrant a â€œaverageâ€?to above average rating .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 4 -1 1 -1		get stick in the elevator we get stick in the elevator , and the management do not seem to care .<ssssss>when we try to talk to the manager on duty julian give we another person to call when we call it we do not get anyone , it be always busy .<ssssss>so we call back down to speak with the general manager about this problem and julian try to brush it off , after request to speak with the general manager he never get back to we .<ssssss>julian even go as far as to lie to we and say it have never happen , but later when he be push about the problem he admit it do happen often .<ssssss>they make it seem like it be we fault they elevator be not work correctly , the elevator should be shut down .<ssssss>so be careful , you can only have 4 people in it -lrb- a sign would be nice -rrb- .<ssssss>also , when we check in they make it sound like we be be upgrade to a suite , the problem be we clearly pay for a room with 4 adult but end up with a room with one bed and a sofa bed .<ssssss>the sofa bed be not comfortable at all !<ssssss>we end up pay around 119 a night , which be so not worth it .<ssssss>when we get back to we room the next day the maid have forget to make the sofa bed up which be clearly pull out and use .<ssssss>the room be also tacky !<ssssss>it have a tropical theme paint around the ceiling .<ssssss>we also have a lovely view of a net , i have no clue what the net be for .<ssssss>the one thing this hotel almost have go for it be location .<ssssss>at night down some street it can be pretty scary , but it be pretty close to a nice area .<ssssss>it be not in a nice area , but it be close to one .<ssssss>if you like this area try another hotel , there be many around it .<ssssss>we use tripadvisor to book this room from the review , but when we get there it all go wrong .<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 4 2 3 5		good business stay with the exception of a few mis-step by the staff , this be a great place to stay with very reasonable rate for its location.my room be -lrb- as request -rrb- face the bay .<ssssss>however , be on the second floor somewhat limited my view , but technically i could see the bay .<ssssss>a couple member of the staff be rather curt in they response when ask for help .<ssssss>however , the younger man at the desk on saturday night be very helpful when i think my hair dryer be break and promptly send a housekeeper to fix the problem.my room be spacious and clean .<ssssss>i do not like that the only place to see the television be from the bed - it do not pull out or swivel at all.the kitchenette be great .<ssssss>this hotel be within walk distance to the space needle .<ssssss>a good value for the money .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 5 4 4 -1		fun to socialize , no chance to sleep the location be great , the room be clean and quite special and a shower in the room be indeed a luxury in nyc for this price .<ssssss>but : do not expect to be able to sleep in you queen bed if you do not use good earplug .<ssssss>the hole between the door and floor make up to 1cm - it be a noble old house , indeed , and nothing be do even for the cheapest soundproof .<ssssss>so you will definitely enjoy the location and the look inside - but to enjoy hear every room and the reception at the same time from one 's bed must be deaf man 's dream .<ssssss>

3 2 2 4 5 2 3 1		convenient but less than comfy the hotel be attach to the mall , very convenient , lot of fun shop , some fast food and nicer dining option also .<ssssss>not much available for late-night or within walk distance if you want alternative to the mall .<ssssss>easy access to major road really help for get around the city.mall lobby/facade be under construction when i stay .<ssssss>not really much of a lobby , just a couple podium at the mall entry .<ssssss>loud sawing/drilling noise start at 8am on friday morning and continue until dusk.bedding be pretty bad - i be not sure why they hype it so much , the comforter be very heavy and scratchy .<ssssss>otherwise the bed be fine , and the room be well keep .<ssssss>lovely bathroom with plenty of water pressure even at the higher floors.the value be not that great for I , but it be probably a good option for business traveler .<ssssss>

4 5 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		great hotel at a great price what a great little hotel .<ssssss>i find it on the internet and be amaze i could find a decent hotel at the price i pay , and decide to go with it because of good review .<ssssss>i be not disappoint .<ssssss>i love the high design , especially the littte touch like different and beautifully color toiletries in the bathroom and cobalt carpeting in the room .<ssssss>the room be a decent size , similar to what i would expect in a european hotel , and the bed be very comfortable .<ssssss>i like have internet access in the lounge on my floor and the coffee that be always available be top notch .<ssssss>the staff be so-so , be very helpful in give I a quiet room , but not very responsive or helpful when i ask for a certain type of restaurant .<ssssss>i be simply tell that they do not know of any of the type ; they do not offer to look any further .<ssssss>i imagine the queen size room on geary st. would be very noisy because of activity on the street itself .<ssssss>i be give a room on the alleyway and it be just what i need .<ssssss>my only complaint be the same as have already be mention - it be a old building and the floor be creaky .<ssssss>i could hear the people above I walk around.all in all , i would very much recommend this hotel , expecially at the price i have .<ssssss>the location be the best , a block from union square and the cable car , near bart and market st. there be restaurant all around , include a starbuck attach to the hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 3 -1 4 -1		no internet access , something like a business centre ?!!??<ssssss>good hotel .<ssssss>breakfast restaurant ????<ssssss>only in-room dining every day ??<ssssss>no computer anywhere for internet access !!!!<ssssss>you be lose without you own laptop.very clean hotel , nice bed .<ssssss>friendly staff at the reception ... maria be wonderful.couldn ` t try the pool due to the bad weather -lrb- storm -rrb- .<ssssss>location good.price ok for the value .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 3 1 1 1		worst customer service ever experience warning !!<ssssss>do not expect to receive the level of customer service at this hotel that you may have experience at other marriott property .<ssssss>we travel very frequently and usually seek out marriott hotel because we be accustom to excellent facility and a very professional staff .<ssssss>this be certainly not true at the new orlean marriott .<ssssss>unfortunately we be book there because of a five-day conference and be not able to leave or we would have vacate shortly after arrive .<ssssss>the front desk manager and she staff be obnoxious , uncaring , and the most unprofessional representative ever assign to deal with incoming customer .<ssssss>the marriott corporation should review this situation immediately .<ssssss>there be many other hotel in new orlean who be struggle to survive and need you business .<ssssss>i encourage you to choose another hotel facility until the marriott corporation ensure that they staff uphold the spirit to serve we guest that they tout on they website .<ssssss>as for we , we will never again stay in a marriott property in the city of new orleans.oh yes , and they charge $ 11.95 daily for internet access in addition to the high cost of room .<ssssss>fortunately , we do not fall into this trap - charge frequent customer for internet service when you can access it free at the local holiday inn .<ssssss>bah , humbug !<ssssss>

1 1 1 4 1 3 4 1		sleep in you car instead we get a room there for the miami boat show , very fewroom be available near the show .<ssssss>my now wife call my cell as i be try to find a parking spot and tell I to bring some scented candle or incence to cover up the smell of must and mold inside the room .<ssssss>and she be not kid !!<ssssss>this place hasnt be update in 30 or so year and the bed be horrible , you know the kind , if you toss you feel every spring in you back , we should have find a store and buy a set of sheet to sleep on , the only thing miss from we experience be the bullet hole in the wall !<ssssss>
4 5 5 4 5 3 3 1		enjoy my stay !<ssssss>i be a little worried after i book my room at this hotel and read some of the review on tripadvisor .<ssssss>i guess that just go to show that you can not -lrb- and should not -rrb- believe everything you read.my stay be very good .<ssssss>i be lucky enough to reserve a king suite , which be actually two seperate room , a living room area and a seperate bedroom .<ssssss>both room be quite spacious and both have a large lcd tv .<ssssss>i stay at this hotel for 4 day and each day my room be clean to near perfection .<ssssss>my only suggestion would be to add a clock radio in the bedroom of the two-room suite and have maintenance change the hvac filter .<ssssss>i do notice the front desk staff lack uniform and name tag and many of they seem to be new employee , lack some guest relation skill one would expect in the hospitality industry.the area be a mix of latino and korean culture , but i find it to be quite interesting .<ssssss>there be many native restaurant in the area that serve very good food .<ssssss>i do not see the adult porn business other have describe and i feel quite safe walk around the area during the day and early afternoon .<ssssss>the hotel be only .8 tenth of a mile from the la convention center and downtown la .<ssssss>my rate be extremely lower than most of my friend rate stay in downtown at the high rise hotel .<ssssss>as a matter of fact i have a much larger room than a friend have at the marriott and my rate be over $ 100 less than he .<ssssss>in other word , i save over $ 400 by stay a little up the road from the excitement of downtown .<ssssss>if i ever return to the la area , i would not think twice about stay at the clarion downtown la hotel .<ssssss>thanks for make my first trip to la a fun time .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 5 -1 2 -1		dissappoint the room be clean and well furnished .<ssssss>security be certainly a problem from the point of view that window could not be leave open when not in the room .<ssssss>shower room toilet on a lower floor to the room slightly noisy due to thin wall breakfast very dissappointing expect to find and rumage around find crockery and cutlery in a room which be use as a internet cafe as well .<ssssss>certainly not what i expect for 85 euro dickie mike very polite friendly<ssssss>
4 -1 5 5 4 3 3 -1		overall nice .<ssssss>we pet goldfish who probably expire right after we leave<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 4 5 3 4		reasonable but nothing special .<ssssss>my wife and i stay at the adriatico for five night in early april .<ssssss>we fly into pisa airport and travel by bus from the airport to florence .<ssssss>the bus drop off , by florence rail station , be a fairly easy walk of about a six or seven minute from the hotel .<ssssss>not particularly impressed at first .<ssssss>the road be pleasantly busy with lot of bustle and noise , cafe , small shop , car hire place , group at table on the pavement , etc. ... .<ssssss>and then someone try unsuccessfully to pick my pocket as we tow we case along the pavement outside the hotel 's main entrance - which happen to be close off because of building work .<ssssss>however , nothing too disastrous , could happen anywhere we think as we wander round to the back entrance .<ssssss>reception staff in particular and other be charming both on arrival and throughout the week .<ssssss>the breakfast be good with plenty of variety , nice lounge area , bar -lrb- but watch the price of drink -rrb- , bedroom and bathroom very clean and modern , comfortable bed , internet access available , flat screen tv , tea and coffee maker in room -lrb- we have to ask though -rrb- and a reasonable view across the roof top towards san lorenzo , fiesolo and the hills.there be several very acceptable place to eat nearby -lrb- il profeta be good and convenient -rrb- , the arno be about two minute walk and the main site be ten to fifteen minute easy walk away.for a superior double the room be bit small ... even for italy .<ssssss>we look at another superior double on the next floor but it be about the same .<ssssss>the one big problem be that the air conditioning could not be adjust as the hotel tell we it be all centrally control .<ssssss>so we have to put up with a very warm room or open the window at night to let some air in - but that mean that the noise from the bar and traffic be a bit too much ... .<ssssss>we tend to have the heat rather than the noise.apart from the air conditioning problem which presumably be just a temporary problem for the time we be there -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>, the adriatico be a reasonable place to stay but it do not have anything particularly special about it .<ssssss>probably a bit cheaper -lrb- book through last minute.com -rrb- than some of the equivalent more centrally located four star hotel .<ssssss>however , for we , it seem a bit too much part of a chain for conferences/business group in a not too wonderful situation .<ssssss>the restaurant be close for most of the week we be there and the builder at the front be still there when we leave .<ssssss>again ... nothing disastrous but if i be go back to florence i would probably try somewhere else .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 2 2 1 1		mouse !<ssssss>horrible management !<ssssss>so rude !<ssssss>we know that a discount rate for this hotel with a great location have to be too good to be true .<ssssss>and it be .<ssssss>this be the worst hotel experience i have ever have .<ssssss>we arrive late , at around midnight , and call they to warn the front desk .<ssssss>we arrive to find that we room have be give away .<ssssss>we understand that the housekeeper start at 8 be but they be extremely loud .<ssssss>they also leave the hallway 's worth of trash in front of we door for a whole day .<ssssss>but worst of all be the mouse .<ssssss>it seem they be crawl under the door and move from room to room because we neighbor have the same problem .<ssssss>they crawl through we bag , food , everything .<ssssss>upon we checkout , which take a solid 45 minute , we request to speak with the manager and explain we problem .<ssssss>we wait another 1/2 hour for the manager to come out .<ssssss>he be clearly very nervous speak to we .<ssssss>he keep say over and over that we could not be compensate at all for the mouse problem , or anything else , because we rate be discount .<ssssss>he be extremely rude and not apologetic at all , say the only thing he could do for we be for we to never stay there again , and force we to leave the lobby .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 3 4 -1 3		4 * ... be you kid I ????<ssssss>just get back from a weekend in amsterdam and stay at this hotel and be absolutely amaze at how bad a hotel that claim to be this good can actually be ... we room overlook a parking garage - the ceiling be less than 7 ' -0 high in the corridor - the dutch be tall people ... have the marriott chain figure that out yet ?<ssssss>the room themselves be nothing to write home about - very average and very ordinary with absolutely no character ... borderline shabby actually .<ssssss>i understand they be undergo a renovation .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the rate should be lower - under any circumstances.booked the hotel at 200 euro a night for a double room with no extra - that too on lastminute.com - the rack rate be significantly higher - 390 euro - and be amaze that they can ask for so much for provide so little .<ssssss>upon check out they up we rate and ask we to pay a 10 euro additional fee -lrb- apart from the tax which be another 10 euro which we be happy to pay -rrb- ... now 10 euro be not a big amount but say that the agency hadnt deduct the right amount from my card be a little lame and frankly , in bad taste .<ssssss>we refuse to pay and they do not press it but it just leave a bad taste in the mouth.amsterdam be a wonderful city - the people be absolutely great - the only selling point for this hotel be its location - right within walk distance to centraal station so get to and from the airport be easy .<ssssss>have say that there be ton of hotel in the area so that be hardly a usp ... in a nutshell - stay elsewhere !<ssssss>
4 3 5 3 5 5 5 -1		nice and spacious , good location .<ssssss>we view<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great location located above the mtr station and central to most hong kong transport and attractions.room very small .<ssssss>we have a fairly small suitcase each and have to empty one so as to be able to stack they one on top of each other in the closet as there be no room anywhere else to put they - include the floor space which be barely large enough to move around in .<ssssss>we be in hk in peak time in april therefore price be also ptretty high -lrb- $ 347 aud per night ex breakfast -rrb- .<ssssss>decor be tired especially the bathroom which have have quite a few shoddy repair do to the fitting and tile .<ssssss>tv reception be also poor .<ssssss>room be very clean and fairly quiet and bed be very comfortable.luckily there be so much to see and do in hk that we spend little time in the hotel .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 3 -1 5 -1		lovely hotel , show it be age we stay at the riu between 9th may - 16th may .<ssssss>the hotel itself be lovely for a 3 star hotel .<ssssss>the hotel staff be just so wonderful - especially ozbel , who must have a extra mention !<ssssss>we ask about upgrade we room to a ocean view on arrival as we couldnt book through we agent .<ssssss>this be no trouble at all , and he also arrange for a bottle of champagne a fruit platter to be send to we room as we be celebrate we 12th anniversary .<ssssss>we room have a fantastic view of the beach and overlook the pool area .<ssssss>the room itself could do with sprucee up , but again , this be a 3 star hotel , not the ritz !<ssssss>the bed be a little too hard for we , and smaller than the average american double , we think .<ssssss>there be no tea/coffee facility which be a shame , as there be no room service and breakfast do not open till 7.30 am sharp - not a minute before !<ssssss>there be a mini bar though !<ssssss>the area surround the hotel do seem to be a bit ` run down ' .<ssssss>there could be some regeneration work go on , as there be a awful lot of buide work go on -lrb- just next door , the saxony seem to be in the process of be rebuild -rrb- although google earth show a dennys restaurant nearby , this be now close .<ssssss>in fact , all the shop on that parade be close with the possible exception of a moped shop - it be impossible to tell , as it look close , but there be a chained up mope in the window !<ssssss>however there be a small ` supermarket ' -lrb- or corner shop / grocer shop -rrb- on the corner , just past the saxony .<ssssss>bar price be as you would expect - hotel price .<ssssss>i would have love to have give this hotel 5 out of 5 but just a few point prevent that .<ssssss>however , as i have say , for a 3 * hotel , you really cant go wrong as long as you expect 3 * !<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 3 4 3		great stay .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we will be back !<ssssss>we just return from a week 's stay at mcv .<ssssss>the one bedroom be spacious and nicely appoint .<ssssss>the bed and soak tub be the highlight of my stay .<ssssss>there be a charge for housekeeping but towel be plentiful .<ssssss>the front desk staff earn a c + grade but the shuttle bus driver be the best -lrb- a + -rrb- !<ssssss>they tell you about the area and restaurant and be always on time.limited daily activity be offer but the fun be at jw marriot.listening to jazz as the sun set be relax and enjoyable .<ssssss>the lazy pool be fun .<ssssss>also , guest from mcv get free valet parking.we be make plan to return next summer .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 3 1 3 2		pfff , what a disappointment !<ssssss>in all honesty , do not waste you money on this hotel .<ssssss>its over rate , over price and definitely do not stand up to the starwood name and i will tell you why .<ssssss>the ac be break in we room and when we call the front desk to see if it could be fix , the receptionist be rude to we tell we we have to deal with it until the ac man could come , but he be not to be come for another 5 day !<ssssss>obviously they could not put we in another room .<ssssss>this be the first hotel where i have be to show my id to get a new room key , they do not even do that in 5 star hotel , who on earth do they think they be ?<ssssss>and it take the receptionist 5 minute to find we reservation.don ' t stay here !<ssssss>seriously , i recommend go for a cheaper and better 2 star hotel or another 3 star hotel because this one be not worth you money .<ssssss>
2 1 3 4 4 3 4 3		would not recommend it we book 4 night accommodation at the novotel century in wan chaus during the month of april but be not very satisfied with the overall experience in this hotel .<ssssss>first of all , we make we book a month prior to we stay and request for non-smoking room .<ssssss>to we disbelief they give we room on the smoking floor -lrb- floor 9 -rrb- which they do not apologise or try to make amends for .<ssssss>the room definitely smell of cigarette which be foul.we also pay $ 1400 hkd for a ` superior ' double room but only to receive a room about the size of a shoe box .<ssssss>they be clean but absolutely tiny without enough room to put we luggage .<ssssss>there be cable tv but most channel be in chinese , otherwise they be business-related program .<ssssss>.<ssssss>im sure most people would agree that have hbo or other movie channel would have be nice.another major complaint be that the wall door in this hotel be paper-thin .<ssssss>.<ssssss>you can hear almost every conversation take place outside you hotel room .<ssssss>.<ssssss>nothing worse than be wake up at 7.00 am because of noisy neighbour .<ssssss>however , the house-keeper shout excuse I , house-keeping at 9.00 be be also inexcusable .<ssssss>.<ssssss>surely they can do it at a more reasonable time so as to allow guest on they holiday to sleep in a little !!<ssssss>very frustrating as they ignore the do not disturb sign.the location be good as it be almost midway between causeway bay and central .<ssssss>the hotel be also situate next to the ferry terminal which allow you to take the star ferry to kowloon .<ssssss>overall though , we feel that the hotel room be over-priced and iwhen you include the other disadvantage such as noise level , inappropriate timing of house-keeping , absolutely tiny size of room and poor window view of old apartment , then novotel century would not be a hotel that i would recommend to other .<ssssss>
5 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		a wonderful stay and hotel we stay at the bravo hotel on july 4th weekend .<ssssss>the staff be absolutely charming and helpful .<ssssss>they make reservation for we for the kayak tour -lrb- blue caribe , very nice people -rrb- .<ssssss>they come to pick we up when we rental car -lrb- marco rental -rrb- break down in the middle of a dirt road ... take we luggage and drop we off at the airport .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very quiet , the view from the restaurent be great -lrb- pool + sea -rrb- .<ssssss>the breakfast + packed lunch be delicious , and i regret i do not have dinner there .<ssssss>vieque ' beach be beautiful and it be not at all a issue not to have the beach at the hotel ... since there be no hotel on the most beautiful beach and you need to drive there ... we will recommand the bravo hotel to anyone go to vieque !<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 5 2 -1		great location , fine stay will stay again if ... .<ssssss>the moore only look a little sketchy from the outside .<ssssss>once you be inside , it be solidly average and a great value in seattle , which have outrageously price hotel , for some bizarre reason.we go into we stay open mind , not expect any more than cleanliness and a great location .<ssssss>yes , the room be spartan -- we opt to splurge on a room with it be own bathroom rather than to share .<ssssss>the tub/shower be fine -- a old clawfoot tub , which be cool .<ssssss>however it be very difficult to regulate the hot water and i get scorch a couple time .<ssssss>the initial staff that we deal with when check in be very pleasant but the night clerk , bill , be a total jerk .<ssssss>one of we pillow be exceptionally flat and when we come in from dinner and a show approximately 10:30 pm , i ask for a additional pillow and another bath towel .<ssssss>bill roll he eye and act like i have ask he to jog around the block twice in he undies .<ssssss>as bill complain and slam thing around in a storage area behind the desk , i tell he , nevermind -- i will make due .<ssssss>he respond with a snarky , yeah , i be just go through the motion here .<ssssss>in other word , he be just pretend to look for a pillow .<ssssss>what a jerk .<ssssss>other than bill , everything be fine at the moore .<ssssss>the location be perfect , we room be clean and comfortable .<ssssss>however , i can imagine that in the summer it must be hot as hell on the upper floor and there be no air conditioning .<ssssss>probably fine for most of the summer but if you get a unexpected heat wave , it would be really uncomfortable .<ssssss>
1 3 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		no aloha at the waikiki parc this be a problematic hotel with serious customer service issue , start with the staff at the front desk .<ssssss>one young woman in particular consistently act as though she have be rouse from hibernation to do she job .<ssssss>i be concern for she health as she may have a sleep disorder .<ssssss>during we five day stay , there be no encounter with the front desk that do not consume a minimum of thirty minute or create auxiliary problem that require later redress i.e. , another trip to the front desk or another time-consuming phone call .<ssssss>there be absolutely no spirit of competency , hospitality , or ordinary courtesy , much less aloha , at the waikiki parc .<ssssss>inexcusable at any hotel , but particularly irritating in hawaii .<ssssss>we love oahu , travel there frequently , and we be very much look forward to we next stay at the moana surfrider .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 2 5 -1		very good but not flawless stay at the langham place in the beginning of august ' 07 .<ssssss>first time in hong kong so i have great memory and i be happy with my choice of stay in the kowloon area .<ssssss>there be plenty to do in kowloon , nice restaurant , young fashion people , nice street market , good view of hong kong .<ssssss>upon leave , i think this would surely be the best hotel i would stay in china in comparison for instance with the peninsula beijing .<ssssss>now i have mix feelings.the property be excellent and the whole complex with the shopping center be fantastic - so much stuff go on at the same time .<ssssss>like one of the previous reviewer , my check-in experience be not one of the best .<ssssss>they seem to be quite lose with the reservation -lrb- let just hope it be just in the beginning of august and not always -rrb- .<ssssss>i have make the reservation month in advance and also confirm by email 2 week before go there and they send I a email confirmation for the select date .<ssssss>i be quite surprised when they call I on the 2nd day tell I i have to leave because it be check-out time already or i would have to pay extra -lrb- ps - i book 4 night -rrb- .<ssssss>also on the 2nd day , because of this mix up , we come back to find the room not service after leave the room for a full day .<ssssss>not 5 star service .<ssssss>breakfast be quite nice but i wouldnt mind if they have a bit more selection .<ssssss>the room be small but have everything you would expect and a few nice tech gadget .<ssssss>the temperature in room and blissful bedtm be quite nice and so be the bathroom.i be a nice guy so i would give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and might stay there again but i would not say it be a flawless experience .<ssssss>there be a lot of lobby atendant dress in pink to direct you inside the hotel which be good because the hotel be quite busy .<ssssss>the concierge be helpful and fluent in english .<ssssss>the whole hotel design be quite nice and classy .<ssssss>

1 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		major disappointment !<ssssss>think i would take the time to share we experience with all of you , since we visit to the hotel arena be a real disappointment .<ssssss>the hotel be far from what it look like on the website , where you would think it be a really hip hotel ... upon we arrival , we be inform that the parking cost around 20 euro day -lrb- not mention anywhere on the website -rrb- , and also that the club be actually not manage by the hotel , mean there be another 20 euro per person to pay for the entrance .<ssssss>most of the staff be very unfriendly and even rude -lrb- waiter at the restaurant tell we do it yourself when we ask they to put we lunch on the room bill , clean maid , when ask to be more quiet since they be shout and slam door , tell we it be no night -rrb- .<ssssss>the so-called large room be cold , both in temperature and style : they try to make the furniture minimalist chic , but it just look cheap ikea .<ssssss>the mirror inside the room be break , the sheet be scratchy and the room be excessively noisy -lrb- from the upper floor and also the corridor -rrb- .<ssssss>there be just a shower , that look like it have not be change since the hotel be a orphanage or a hostel .<ssssss>to put it in a nutshell , the public area -lrb- reception , bar , restaurant , club -rrb- be fool you , make the hotel look nice and hip , when the room be just upscale hostel , but far from what you would expect from a 3 * , for 100â‚ ?<ssssss>a night .<ssssss>i would definitely not advise my friend to visit this hotel .<ssssss>it be so bad that we check out just after 2 hour in the hotel , which really waste we weekend in amsterdam .<ssssss>other advice : do not take you car to amsterdam , the parking be too expensive -lrb- 30â‚ ?<ssssss>a day -rrb- and , cherry on the cake , someone break into we car !<ssssss>
3 2 3 3 5 3 3 1		choose carefully -- this hotel may or may not be for you !<ssssss>â€?we stay at the ala moana for we two night in honolulu because my first night there be already pay for by the university and it seem like a lot of trouble to change hotel for just one night .<ssssss>in retrospect , i canâ€™t decide if iâ€™m sorry about that or not .<ssssss>we find the hotel to be adequate overall , but itâ€™s certainly nothing we would have choose for ourselves .<ssssss>the location next to the ala moana shopping center be ideal for those who want to shop , and it be about a 15 minute amble to the waterâ€™s edge of the ala moana park .<ssssss>we room , # 757 in the kona tower , be tiny but nicely appoint with a queen bed , pull-out sofa , and a flat screen tv which we never turn on .<ssssss>we immediate view be of the parking garage for the mall , with the marina and then the ocean beyond that .<ssssss>there be a slide glass door but no balconyâ€”excuse I , lanaiâ€”to speak of .<ssssss>the temperature control be a old-fashioned variety so that the fan could be hot or cold , on or off , and it be always humid in the room .<ssssss>we either freeze with the fan on all night or suffocate with it off .<ssssss>by the time we check out any clothing that have be leave out in the room be noticeably damp .<ssssss>the complimentary high-speed internet be a joke .<ssssss>the one time we be able to get a connection , it take entire minute to load the homepage .<ssssss>we wait so long for we email to download that we leave it while we go to dinner but the connection time out before we return .<ssssss>wi-fus be available , but for a charge !<ssssss>in a business/convention hotel !<ssssss>base on the rate we pay we last night , $ 149/night plus tax , iâ€™d say this place be a okay value .<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 3 -1 5 -1		a 7 out of 10 the hotel itself be quite cute and in a central s.f. location .<ssssss>there be plenty of shopping and eating within walk distance .<ssssss>the room be very tiny and the bathroom be also small .<ssssss>you can not wash you face in the sink due to the size .<ssssss>as a woman , i may stay here again , but my husband say no way !<ssssss>it be difficult to get to the hotel with the one-way street .<ssssss>you can not hail a cab though b/c the cab driver go across the street to the marriot which be very frustrating .<ssssss>the mosser doorman try for 30 minute to hail we a cab and finally give up , which ton of cab be go across the street at the more expensive hotle .<ssssss>we get in the marriot line to get a cab .<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 5 5 4 4		a solid 4 star i know this hotel get rave review .<ssssss>this be not one of they .<ssssss>this be a four star hotel masquerade as a five star hotel .<ssssss>the difference between a club room here on a saturday night and a room at the park hyatt be about $ 50-100 and there be no comparison .<ssssss>the room be not in same class as the park hyatt and be frankly a disappointment for the money .<ssssss>it be on the small side and in term of style ; more department store catalogue rather than a designer experience.the staff at the cerulean be obviously train to be attentive , however , it can become a bit too much .<ssssss>they be all lovely but such enthusiasm at breakfast !<ssssss>the club breakfast be serve in the signature dining room with a sensational view and it be very good .<ssssss>but a formally serve five course breakfast be a bit like the enthusiasm , a bit much first thing in the morning .<ssssss>wonderful coffee be a big plus .<ssssss>you can opt for a continental breakfast at the club , but the selection be ridiculously meagre.the club cocktail hour be very light on too , the club area be small and the standard range of hors d'oeuvre be so poor as to be laughable .<ssssss>it be not comparable to the normal club lounge scenario , however again the view be wonderful.the location be good for this side of tokyo so if you really want to stay in shibuya then i suggest you take a standard room and skip the extra expense of a club room .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i suspect all room be identical to the club room but other be on a lower level of the hotel .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the lobby be full on , always full and bustling .<ssssss>some people may like that , but it feel like the rest of shibuya , packed and trendy .<ssssss>it be no retreat from the outside world.yep , after three day the cerulean make I finally feel my age .<ssssss>i probably resent that but what i resent more be pay for 5 star and get a good solid four star experience with a few flourish around the edges.the cerulean be a hotel that really try to be more than it is.the park hyatt or mandarin oriental be in a different class .<ssssss>
5 4 4 3 5 5 3 3		good no-frills hotel for great price have stay in other holiday inn express around the world so this be a safe choice on a business trip .<ssssss>the 2-way closing door in the bathroom be a cool trick which be also there in the hong kong edition of this hotel.most of what need to be say have already be say - wide breakfast choice -lrb- although after 7 day i be get a bit tired of it - some hot cook food would be good ! -rrb-<ssssss>, clean basic room , no wardrobe door be a bit too minimalist but do not bother me.my shower have a still so no problem with water leakage out.short walk to the nearest s-bahn but find it more useful to travel by u-bahn so a slightly longer 15 min walk to either potsdamer platx or mendelssohn park .<ssssss>concierge be helpful enough to suggest the direct u-bahn train with short bus shuttle to schoenfield airport on my departure .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 3 1 1 1		warn - more poor star than four star awful awful awful , it beggar belief how this hotel be award a four star rating .<ssssss>the staff be rude , the room be average , the internet be overprice .<ssssss>this hotel and the staff be obviously so confident of business from the nearby conference centre that they feel they can treat guest as they wish .<ssssss>unfortunately this hotel and it be staff be my first introduction to barcelona , luckily after endure the accommodation for almost a week we move to another hotel in barcelona , also four star , considerably cheaper with friendly staff , great facility etc etc. think before you stay here , i stay with a very large group for business reason and 99 % of people have a negative experience mainly with staff attitude .<ssssss>

3 1 3 4 4 4 1 -1		disappointed its a pretty hotel with lovely room not 5 star but clean and well keep up .<ssssss>we be disappoint in the crowd , it be not the usual jw crowd , it be sort of a midwest tatto crowd , not the usual preppy golf crowd .<ssssss>we be out there for a wedding but soend 5 day just relax and enjoy the sun , only it be awful sit at the pool .<ssssss>the pool be more of a lazy rivier disneyesque feel .<ssssss>the lounge chair be horrible , they have no pad on they and there be no one to set up the chair and lay out towel for us.people be slob throw empty drink cup all over the place .<ssssss>we feel the service be so so , no one be too friendly out there .<ssssss>we end up sit on the cushy patio chair alot more and we also pay the extra $ 35.00 per day per person to sit at the spa pool which have a very different crowd , more east coast and no tatto and people be dress better and have guccus 's and lv bags.normally we go to the phoenician but it be over book , and we plan this last minute .<ssssss>it be just a so so feeling and we spend about $ 400 per night and we feel it be like a fancy day inn.the pool area be just pack with people and you feel really squeeze in and not as if you be at a top resort .<ssssss>we win ; t go back there again , the corwd be really not what we expect and the people be wild at the pool and no one watch they child all that well .<ssssss>the waitress be slow and not friendly , the front desk crew be excellent.wish i have better thing to say .<ssssss>
1 1 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		tacky never before have the word disgraceful be more befitting of a hotel or resort .<ssssss>from its ill-conceived stucco faÃ§ade to its dark and murky room , this hotel be obviously build by people who have all the money in the world but not so much as one once of good taste .<ssssss>the lobby , which be intend by its designer -lrb- s -rrb- to be eclectically hip , resemble a vomitus collage of remnant from a over-budgeted late 90 mtv production set .<ssssss>the inadequately train front desk staff be miserably tragic .<ssssss>they incompetence and poor attention to detail be nothing short of astounding .<ssssss>perhaps most embarrassing be they complete lack of the most basic knowledge of the local surroundings in term of suggestion for restaurant , nightlife , or even the simplest of drive direction .<ssssss>the food at the dragonfly be inedible , overpriced , and scantily apportion .<ssssss>the bar crowd consist mostly of millionaire wannabe , retiree , and lose look business traveler who would probably be much better off drink away they forlornness at any one of the dozen of nearby restaurant or lounge .<ssssss>in my opinion , those who would endorse this place to other as be â€œreally coolâ€?are probably as devoid of class and taste as the hotel itself , and deserve every bit of the poor , unpolished disservice that await they in this tawdry , malodorous dwelling .<ssssss>i can not wait for the ritz carlton and w hotel to shut this place down , hopefully forever .<ssssss>

3 2 5 3 5 4 2 -1		be not as impressed as i want to be ... i really want to love the omnus from everything i hear about it , read about it , and see on they website -- and from the price i be pay to stay there !!<ssssss>but honestly , i really be not that impressed ... i stay for one night because i be there to see jersey boy which be play at the ahmanson theater , within easy walk distance from the omnus .<ssssss>the only thing i can truly say be the best thing about the omnus be it be close proximity to the theaters.getting there be a bit of a hassle because the driveway be so small , not very many car can fit in the driveway at one time , so there be a line of car wait for the valet ... which be way overprice .<ssssss>but parking on the street , while cheaper , be too dangerous , because they be not in the best of neighborhood !<ssssss>no real way around it .<ssssss>the hotel itself be nice enough , but could be better .<ssssss>i be expect to be more wow than i be .<ssssss>we have a king bed and a sleeper sofa - we room overlook the pool .<ssssss>the pool , by the way , be a small lap pool that be overcrowded with child the whole time , so there be no way to swim lap even have i want to .<ssssss>they provide we with one robe in we closet , we call to ask for another one to be send up , and be tell it would be up shortly .<ssssss>we never receive it.after see jersey boy , we walk back to the hotel and have to go all the way around to the main entrance because the back entrance be lock after 10:30 pm - seem like they should let guest in with they hotel key since it be a much more convenient entrance/exit to the plaza and theater ... we stop into the bar/lounge on we way back up to we hotel room , and wait literally 8 minute before someone come to take we order .<ssssss>yes , we could have walk up to the bar ourselves and order and get we drink faster , that be not the point here .<ssssss>the point be that it be not very crowded or busy , and i know that staff notice we be there , yet it take they 8 minute to come take we order .<ssssss>after the manager come over to take we order -lrb- yes , the manager take we order , despite there be 3 other wait staff there -rrb- he apologize that it take so long to be wait on - then we wait another 10 minute -lrb- yes ... 10 minute - we keep track -rrb- to actually get we drink .<ssssss>we order a rum and coke , and a cosmopolitan ... it be not rocket science !<ssssss>the manager come back with we drink , and apologize again for how long it take , and say that we drink be on the house - a nice gesture , but it still be completely ridiculous that it take that long to get wait on and get we drink !<ssssss>i probably would not stay here again unless i be able to get a super great rate there .<ssssss>

3 3 5 4 3 2 3 -1		could do better spend two night here in june .<ssssss>have read the rave review we be somewhat disappointed .<ssssss>first impression be certainly not good ; the reception staff do not exactly fall over themselves to be helpful and the decor seem a little fade .<ssssss>the pool area be very average and some new soft furnish be clearly need .<ssssss>feel better when we have settle in - the room be large and comforatble and my wife love the bath .<ssssss>enjoy a excellent meal in the restaurant though again the decoration be a little old fashoin .<ssssss>highlight of stay be sit in a courtyard with a bottle of wine under the star .<ssssss>like the feel of the place in the evening with lot of clever lighting and quiet acoustic guitar .<ssssss>overall it be ok .<ssssss>think they will need to up they game if they want to maintain they price .<ssssss>the spanish colonial theme be great but clearly need a little refurbishment<ssssss>
3 2 2 3 2 5 2 5		not impressed one bit !<ssssss>i have be to many resort all over the caribbean and this by far be the most interesting .<ssssss>be american , i have never feel unappreciated when travel but i definitely do at the grand palladium .<ssssss>from the very beginning , i be a little leary but nonetheless optimistic ; have read many of the review here but the scenery from the airport to the resort honestly ... have I nervous .<ssssss>it be hard to imagine that a upscale resort would be smack in the middle of what look like a war-stricken city .<ssssss>but low and behold after a 25 minute ride we arrived.the check-in process be extremely quick and easy and the desk staff all speak english very well .<ssssss>but apparently ... they be the only one .<ssssss>although i know the native languare be spanish , i guess i just expect too much .<ssssss>room : we travel agent have already tell we to bring air freshener because the room at the grand palladium be know to have a slight odor when you first open the door because of the high humidity and the type of hvac system the resort have .<ssssss>well slight odor be a understatement .<ssssss>the room smell like sweatsock and although it do dissipate after use lysol , candle and bure insence ; it never completely go away .<ssssss>i do not know about anyone else , but i do not want to spend the kind of money we do per night ever again and have to contend with sleep in what smell like a old gym .<ssssss>the other thing that really burn I be that everyday we room be clean , the housekeeping staff never leave face cloth .<ssssss>so every evening we have to go through 3,4 sometimes 5 different people to get someone to understand what exactly we need .<ssssss>after a long hot day in the sun , it be rather irritating to have to wait up to 90 minute to be able to shower because we have to wait for someone to bring clean face cloth .<ssssss>by the third day , we just hide the used one in we luggage so they would not take they when they clean .<ssssss>the bathroom in the room be a little yucky as well .<ssssss>i be not sure if it be the color of the marble in the shower stall that make it seem dirty and mildewyor what but even after housekeeping be in there be no smell of disinfectant or anything so you do not know if it have really be clean or not.beach : i be really bother by the annoying , over aggressive vulture try to sell you thing on the beach .<ssssss>i be there to relax .<ssssss>if i be interested in shopping i would have go to visit the shop at the other end of the beach .<ssssss>i really think there be something more that the management of the resort can do to prevent this on they section of beach and i strongly recommend that they do .<ssssss>food : we eat in every restaurant at the resort while we be there ... all 11 ; and although good , i would not say they be 5 not 5 star .<ssssss>the behique be the better location for lunch with great service and smile wait staff .<ssssss>cantina mariachus and bamboo be the better a la carte restaurant for dinner .<ssssss>el quijote be not bad either .<ssssss>arrecife have a wonderful t-bone steak but you would better not ask for it well-done because it just will not happen .<ssssss>mare nostrum 's sauce be rather watery and the salad bar be skimpy .<ssssss>the royal gourmet and la uva be very loud , stifle hot and the service be very slow.shows : the acoutic in the amphitheater be poor so it make it very difficult to understand what be be say , particularly when the emcee speak in several different language rapid fire .<ssssss>but the actual show be awesome each night!pools : the pool need to be empty , clean and rechlorinate ; especially the one with swim up bar .<ssssss>there be straw and empty cup float in the one near behique each time we visit .<ssssss>excursion : we book we excursion through apple vacation .<ssssss>the atv ride be a lot of fun and well worth the $ 85 .<ssssss>the ride to the meeting spot be rather long and exciting , but the ride along the beach front be great !<ssssss>manati park be a bust though .<ssssss>not worth $ 10 let alone $ 30 .<ssssss>it bill as a tropical zoo ... but it it be a 1/4 acre dirt pad with 20 animal in the middle of nowhere with overpriced photograph and food .<ssssss>overall , the grand palladium be overprice because the little annoyance just add upt too quickly .<ssssss>i would visit the island again , but not this particular resort .<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 5 5 5 4		henk rule !<ssssss>great stay !<ssssss>my wife and i travel to amsterdam in july 07 and stay at this charming little hotel .<ssssss>it be a real treat !<ssssss>first the good-the owner/proprietor/manager henk be a super-fantastic guy , very helpful and proto-typically dutch efficient .<ssssss>the rest of the staff be good too when he be not there .<ssssss>the room be clean , well appoint .<ssssss>hotel be very safe and the area around it be pleasant/upscale .<ssssss>the breakfast be good , the internet access be great .<ssssss>overall , the hotel itself be probably the best hotel i have ever stay at while in europe that i pay for myself -lrb- i have stay in better hotel but only when use a expense account -rrb- .<ssssss>the bad -lrb- or maybe the less than good -rrb- - the hotel be a good 40 minute walk from central station , and easily 30 minute or more from dam square .<ssssss>it be close to the art museum , but from the fun stuff it be a distance .<ssssss>normally not a big deal because the tram stop be close to the hotel , but the tram stop run at midnight and bus service after that time be spotty .<ssssss>my wife and i stay out til 2 one night and have to walk back in the rain.other than that ... great place .<ssssss>would i reccomend it ?<ssssss>unless you have to be within close distance of the rld/dam square , yes .<ssssss>but next time ... i might try to get a place closer in so there be not so much walking ... either that , or i will rent a bike .<ssssss>but the hotel itself ... outstanding .<ssssss>

4 4 2 5 2 5 4 5		mixed feeling we stay at the soniat house during the thanksgiving holiday and be mostly impressed .<ssssss>particularly love the breakfast -- it be serve most elegantly , absolutely delicious and worth the extra money -lrb- although it really should be include in the rate -rrb- .<ssssss>we room be very traditional , have access to a verandah overlook the french quarter and the horse and buggy go by .<ssssss>but -- there be very little light for reading and the bathroom really need maintenance -lrb- tile crack etc -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a embarrassing 15 tv which we never use .<ssssss>the staff be very accomodating .<ssssss>the whole place reek of decadent n. orlean atmosphere .<ssssss>if you want mod convenience -lrb- i.e. a gym , flat screen -rrb- this be not the place , although there be free wireless service which we appreciated.not sure if we would return there , but it definitely be a place to try once .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 5 5 2 5		excellent hotel with somewhat unneccessary rule i would be to hong kong for the past 10 year and often stay at hotel around tsim tsa tsuus area because it be close to some shopping area .<ssssss>this time , my family and i decide to stay at peninsula .<ssssss>when we step in , we find nothing exceptionally special about the decor .<ssssss>just plain , white pillar , and the design be probably european style but much simpler .<ssssss>the receptionist be excellent and guide we right into the room .<ssssss>customer service be just excellent until the next day when we go down for breakfast .<ssssss>once i sit down , someone tell I something in broken english and pointed to my pants and sandal so i believe he be talk about my short pants and sandal but for heaven sake !<ssssss>i spend so much money stay in this hotel in the middle of a hot summer month just to be ask to dress into something more ` approvable .<ssssss>just because of that , i will never return to the hotel .<ssssss>seriously , sheraton be much better -lrb- just right across -rrb- .<ssssss>they have no such restriction , it be half the price , they bed be heavenly -lrb- yes , better than peninsula 's -rrb- and the people speak excellent english.plus , they have a sky lounge with very fresh oyster .<ssssss>

2 1 1 4 1 4 5 2		disappointed i read all the review on tripadvisor before decide on eastgate.so i think i be surprise when we see we room .<ssssss>i know the furniture and decor would be basic but i guess i think it would be clean and functional.i thoroughly agree with the assessment about the staff be friendly , but honestly i feel the reason that be so noticeable be because of the shortcomings.as a example , the 2 bedroom supposedly have a full kitchen with all the necessity .<ssssss>well , there be only 2 plate and 4 glass , no pot and pan etc. so , i have to call to get it.after a while , i get tire of call .<ssssss>there be not enough sheet , pillow towel , you name it.the furniture be old and dirty as be the carpet.here be my conclusion ... .<ssssss>it appear those that get a real deal love the place .<ssssss>but i pay almost 2 thousand dollar for 5 day ... i know it be a holiday weekend , so expect to pay more .<ssssss>but i would never stay there again.worse yet , they keep send I email with weekend special ... geez !!<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 5 2 4 2		good for relax holiday on arrival we speak to a unfriendly younger male staff member .<ssssss>he give we a room on a 20 + floor .<ssssss>upon arrival in the room we notice it be a smoking room .<ssssss>both of we be non-smoker and we have request a non-smoking room .<ssssss>when we point this out , another staff member quickly give we the only non-smoking room leave , which have a sea view but no useable balcony.the room be very clean and welcome to come home to at night .<ssssss>we like the free minibar , although it would have be better if you could choose the drink in it beforehand .<ssssss>the bed be amazing and consist of two rather large individual mattress .<ssssss>we fall in the space between they once but that be we own fault .<ssssss>the window blind be excellent .<ssssss>the ensuite bathroom give the room a cold , modern look and be not entirely practical .<ssssss>we get it out of sight by put down the blind in between room and bathroom .<ssssss>the toilet offer virtually no privacy .<ssssss>it isnt even possible to close it properly and it have a see through door .<ssssss>luckily there be plenty of toilet available on the lower floors.the shower be fantastic .<ssssss>it be build for taller people , but you can change the direction of the showerhead so that be not a problem .<ssssss>amenity be good.always keep the do not disturb sign on when you do not want the room to be make up yet , as the housekeeping staff be very quick to go in .<ssssss>i also find they to be the best housekeeping staff i have ever encounter .<ssssss>very friendly .<ssssss>one lady go out of she way to find we two bathrobe and everyone be very courteous.what truly make we stay be the breakfast .<ssssss>it be excellent in every way .<ssssss>staff be very professional .<ssssss>variety be very good .<ssssss>truly relax start of the day.the swimming pool be ` lounge area ' rather than mean for actual swimming .<ssssss>lounge chair be occupy pretty early every day .<ssssss>the swimming pool downstairs be too chilly , with everyone able to look at you when walk aroundin the hotel .<ssssss>the swimming pool on the 23rd floor offer a great view of the sea .<ssssss>however , only one person can swim in it at once so its at best use as a occasional refreshment .<ssssss>the area quickly get very very crowd on a sunny day , with people lounge very close to eachother without available chair left.location be rather far from city sight , but close to the beach and to the big shopping complex right next door .<ssssss>not good location for experience nightlife unless you take a cab.overall , we have a very relaxing stay , thoroughly enjoy breakfast and would come back next time we visit barcelona .<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 4 4 -1 2		business only i stay frequently at this hotel , not by enthusiasm but because it be the one select by my company.lobby / lounge area be fine ; too short menu at the bar , but food be decent .<ssssss>very kind reception staff.once you move to the room , it become another story.rooms be tiny except executive room ; door be of the noisy slam type , and sound insulation be poor .<ssssss>sometimes they seem to have some difficulty start breakfast service at 7 am.as a whole , definitively not up to the claim 5 star , but a correct business hotel if you need be in this area .<ssssss>

4 2 4 5 5 -1 5 5		nice place if you be not pay this be a excellent hotel , with large room decorate in a tasteful modern style , great service , and a very convenient location for both leisure and business travellers.i do have several reservation about it , though .<ssssss>some of these reservation be about relatively minor thing .<ssssss>one be that the bathroom be very obviously not soundproof from the rest of the room , which be a real nuisance , even if you be very good friend with you roommate .<ssssss>another be that i just do not feel as contented here as i do at the melbourne westin .<ssssss>i can not really explain why .<ssssss>my main reservation be that this place be really expensive , even by the standard of other , similar , sydney hotel .<ssssss>i note that many of the other review about this hotel say much the same thing .<ssssss>i be glad i be not the one who be pay for this particular stay in sydney , and i doubt i will ever be use this hotel on any of my sydney visit as a pay guest .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 4 4 -1		begin to fray this hotel be begin to show sign of need a overhaul in term of its room quality .<ssssss>we stay just one night there , want to be in a good location in central boston .<ssssss>could not fault location , but the room be small , the bathroom large , but the shower be barely more than a trickle .<ssssss>the hotel need to upgrade its television , ours be not flat screen and the front flap be fall off .<ssssss>one of the bedside lampshade be stain and in general the upholstery in the room look tired .<ssssss>i would say this hotel need to look lively if it be to retain its position as a ranking hotel.we move to jury 's from the westin waterfront -- on all count apart from location jury fall short of the westin .<ssssss>overprice and rest on its laurel -- which very much need to be refresh ...<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 2 1 1 3		never again - very dissappointed .<ssssss>when we arrive at the ramayana they do not find we reservation .<ssssss>we book online via a internet travel agency .<ssssss>later it become clear they book I under my front name .<ssssss>when we get to we deluxe room - we be really dissappointed again .<ssssss>the room be quite dark and outdated .<ssssss>the bathroom be wear and shabby .<ssssss>the worse however be the bed .<ssssss>it be just a simple wooden plate with a very old and worn matrass .<ssssss>sit on the bed we hit the wood underneat the old and worn matrass immediately .<ssssss>we be sure we could not sleep on that.therefore we ask to change the matrass - answer : no can do!we want to change room - okay - matrass just as bed !<ssssss>we decide to agree , since it be only one night before we left.the complimentary water in the room be already open en half empty , so we have to call reception for a new fresh bottle.the towel be not clean , and after take a bath , the whole bathroomfloor become soaked , since the water come up from a hole in the floor -lrb- drain system -rrb- .<ssssss>we ask for a wake up call since we have a early flight out of bali - never get the call.we ask for a breakfast box - we get it - but it be ridiculous - for a 4 star hotel you will not expect 2 very small sweet , 1 boil egg , butter and jam , and a small apple -lrb- no napkin , no plastic knife , no drink -rrb- .<ssssss>how do i put butter on this small sweet ?<ssssss>do i eat my boil egg with the apple or with the sweet ?<ssssss>not worth the 4 star rating .<ssssss>the pool be very small and have very little chair around it.we have to pay 15.000 rp for a short local phonecall , where the other hotel in kuta only charge we 3000 .<ssssss>they reception people we find not friendly .<ssssss>i have stay in the lokha legian for much less money and we enjoy it much better .<ssssss>it be not a good experience for we .<ssssss>i would not recommend this place .<ssssss>

2 2 1 4 1 3 -1 -1		the old bait this hotel be in serious need of a facelift .<ssssss>or i should say , the room be in need of a face lift .<ssssss>when you walk into the lobby area it be very pretty and invite .<ssssss>however , when you get to you room , it be a different story .<ssssss>hence this review title of bait switch .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable enough and the room be plenty large .<ssssss>however , the bathroom be gross and in serious need of update .<ssssss>i actually see two room during my stay since i ask to switch my first room and the bathroom look edexactly the same ; dingy , dirty , and badly in need of update .<ssssss>the small square tile in the shower be in need of more grout and alot of caulking be miss around the tub .<ssssss>the bathroom remind you of a motel 6 .<ssssss>i would stay elsewhere if you can .<ssssss>however , if you book of priceline or hotwire the way i do , good luck to you .<ssssss>

2 3 1 5 4 3 1 -1		excellent location , not so good accomodation we stay here in october because of the review we have see on tripadvisor.the location of this hotel could not be better .<ssssss>it be in a really nice residential area , 5 minute walk to the van gogh museum.the owner be not the friendliest people we have meet ; i would go so far as to say rude .<ssssss>they have a lot to learn about the hospitality business .<ssssss>the room we stay in be at the top of the guesthouse and be very small , cramped and noisy.overall i would not recommend this guesthouse .<ssssss>
2 1 1 3 1 3 2 2		it be far from perfect !<ssssss>we stay there 10/15 thru 10/27 , 2008 .<ssssss>housekeeping service be awful -- floor be not sweep once while we be there , bathroom not clean once , and some day the bed be not make up .<ssssss>we book thru they website , which promise a wonderful breakfast -- what we get be burn toast , which i would not classify as wonderful .<ssssss>we book a superior deluxe room because we want more space , but room be barely big enough to walk around the bed .<ssssss>they charge 48 rmb for soap , wash cloth , etc , per person .<ssssss>we go to store and buy these item for less than 8 rmb .<ssssss>upon check-in , we be present with price list for item in the fully stock mini-bar , which be empty , but not a big deal as the refrigerator do not work .<ssssss>we send jeans out to be launder , they come back not iron .<ssssss>room suppose to contain iron and iron board , but do not .<ssssss>at request , they do provide a iron , but only outlet it would fit do not work .<ssssss>i can go on and on , but suffice to say , this be not a 3-star !<ssssss>location be good , and most front desk staff do speak some english and be helpful .<ssssss>room internet access do not work , but someone come promptly and set it up on my computer .<ssssss>this place have lot of potential , but as it be , i would not recommend stay there .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 3 1 1 2		run run far away !!!<ssssss>i be so disappointed i could not let other have the same miserable stay , so i think i would write my review .<ssssss>we book this hotel through priceline for a girl friend getaway .<ssssss>priceline could not guarantee room type , so i call the hotel to see if we could get a room with two double bed .<ssssss>i be tell that it would not be a problem .<ssssss>upon arrive front desk say he do not have any double clean , could i come back in a hour ?<ssssss>we come back in a hour and the same clerk inform we that they be sell out of double but he could give we a king suite with a fold out couch .<ssssss>-lrb- he lie to we on arrival ??? -rrb-<ssssss>of course the king suite be a nice room but the pull out bed be uncomfortable - as they all be .<ssssss>to top this off there be a major construction site go on behind the hotel .<ssssss>the review i read all suggest request a room in the back for peace and quiet .<ssssss>this be not a option !!!<ssssss>construction start bright and early at 6:30 am .<ssssss>aaargh !!<ssssss>the staff seem genuinely concern of we difficulty but could not do anything for we .<ssssss>since we book on priceline we be stick .<ssssss>we request ticket from the concierge twice and both time have to call several time to confirm - would have be easier to have handle myself .<ssssss>to top it all off , the day before we leave , housekeeping remove all of we newspaper .<ssssss>i know it sound silly but we be save the paper for the date as a scrapbook souvenir .<ssssss>they be fold neatly on the desk - what housekeeper take anything out of you room but what be in the trashcan ??!!??<ssssss>again , inform the manager get we a shrug and a apology but no result .<ssssss>the only bright spot on we visit be wilmore who help we with we luggage and hail cab .<ssssss>what a sweet gentleman !<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 5 5 5 4		interesting experience my husband and i stay three night at granado 83 .<ssssss>we room be small , but very well design and modern .<ssssss>we view , as other reviewer have state , be of a empty lot across the street .<ssssss>pool and gym be tiny.free internet access , but you do need to rent a cable from the hotel.the staff be excellent , helpful and friendly .<ssssss>housekeeping too.our only issue - smoke permeate we room .<ssssss>room be supposedly smoke-free , but we think it may have come through the vent from the restaurant and bar throughout the hotel .<ssssss>i be pretty sensitive to smoke , so end up with congestion in my lung that pretty much last throughout we two-week trip .<ssssss>we love the wonderful restaurant and neighborhood of the eixample surround granado 83 .<ssssss>we have most likely stay in the same area , but different hotel .<ssssss>
1 1 4 5 4 1 1 -1		not a place to relax !<ssssss>discrimination against visitor at first everything be fine if not great.but believe it or not , they do not allow bermuda shorts in the lobby area .<ssssss>we know it until the 4th day of the stay when a rude -lrb- maybe drunk -rrb- porter approach we on we way to the long bar .<ssssss>we be ask to leave the lobby as soon as possible even we be just greet with a big smile from the doorman .<ssssss>at the same time , we see a couple of guest sit 20 foot from we with shorts chat loudly , and the porter be fine with that .<ssssss>as we be late for a party , we later take the case to the management and be tell that they do have this dress code , but they will be flexible with hotel guest .<ssssss>so i guess it be we fault not to identify ourselves whenever someone try to approach I .<ssssss>i just could not imagine something else to wear after a long day of conference and the air be 100 + degrees.and , if you be here just for the over-rated singapore sling , be prepare to dress up as you do not have the privilege to relax .<ssssss>

and sweet.airport : wow : short and sweet , 30 min to the hotel .<ssssss>10 $ tourist card be include in we package -lrb- fly with sunwing -rrb- .<ssssss>you do need the 20 $ departure fee when check in on departure.check-in : amazing service on arrival .<ssssss>we have a vip/honeymoon package so they assign someone from the guest service desk to assist we for the check-in .<ssssss>take we aside and make all we a la carte reservation right away include a special honeymoon romantic dinner at the seafood restaurant.room : we end up in 2217 -lrb- block 2 , 2nd floor , room 17 -rrb- which face the pool in front of the towel hut and pool bar .<ssssss>great location as it be not too close from the swim up bar where the activity take place but close to everything include lobby and restaurant but only a short walk to the beach .<ssssss>room itself be beautiful with jaccuzi .<ssssss>as per we vip/honeymoon package , we receive a bottle of white wine and some finger food at the room the first 2 night -lrb- around 5pm -rrb- , a fuit basket and champagne on arrival and a breakfast in bed on tue morning .<ssssss>amazing.restaurants : this be where the resort lack a little bit in quality .<ssssss>the buffet be pretty varied and offer some very good item .<ssssss>the a la carte be somewhat comparable to all other resort we have visit .<ssssss>the japanese be pretty good but be also pretty typical with 8 folk sit around the cooking table where the chef prepare the food and then serve everything at once on a plate .<ssssss>the steakhouse be pretty good also other than they cook everything early and re-heat the food as necessary -lrb- this be why you steak arrive in about 10 min ... -rrb- .<ssssss>do not go there at 10pm as you will get the leftovers -lrb- we do that one night and the brochete be overcooked and hard -rrb- .<ssssss>we romantic dinner be at the seafood and we be assign we own server with a nice table at the edge of the pool .<ssssss>we didnt ' get to pick the food but end up with some gamba and small beef filet which be ok .<ssssss>carribean/mexican be not great but offer variety .<ssssss>again , overall , lot of choice but i would not compare the food to a sandal as far as quality .<ssssss>but the important thing here be we do not get sick and do not loose any weight ... lol!beach / pool : amazing .<ssssss>always room under palapa and plenty of chair regardless of time of day .<ssssss>we do the beach in the morning and pool in the afternoon and never a problem .<ssssss>pretty windy on the beach the last couple of day so sand everywhere so we stick to the pool more .<ssssss>never a problem exchange towel either -lrb- we do 2 or 3 time a day -rrb- .<ssssss>activity : typical stuff go on at the beach but mostly near the swim up bar .<ssssss>this be where everyone would go for a drink and watch around 4pm everyday .<ssssss>show : again typical .<ssssss>we watch 3 night .<ssssss>the best be the michael jackson .<ssssss>other night be the typical guy against girl , mister majestic etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>sad thing be that the show do not start until 10pm , very late ... disco : we manage to stay up one night and make it to the club where everyone end up right after the show be over -lrb- around 11pm -rrb- .<ssssss>only carribean music but a good crowd on hand when we went.gym : not bad for a resort gym .<ssssss>there be ac but the door be always be open by some curious folk so it do get warm.there be a attendant there who look after the eqpt/towels etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>he be constantly near you as you be work out so it can be a bit annoying .<ssssss>lot 's of bikes/treadmill and some free weight and nautilus eqpt so you can have a decent workout.service : well , i be go to choose my word carefully -lrb- as my wife say ... so not to offend anyone here -rrb- .<ssssss>i be only indicate this as to offer advice for those who be seek a resort with a specific clientele and staff .<ssssss>first off there be a issue with english speak staff .<ssssss>most do not understand english at all although the guest service staff be incredible and fluent in english .<ssssss>however , most server or shop attendant do not speak much english .<ssssss>lucky for we we also speak french and some of those do too so we manage .<ssssss>the lady at the mini-mart be extremely serious , never smile and get offend when my wife be look at t-shirt -lrb- unfold they to see the logo ... -rrb- .<ssssss>additionally , most of the customer be spanish speaking .<ssssss>again , not try to offend anyone here .<ssssss>i believe that this resort cater to those folk a bit more as the majority be spanish speaking .<ssssss>this be perfectly acceptable and might not be something the resort be look for originally .<ssssss>it be not a big issue for we but if you be a french speaking person from quebec city who do not speak english or spanish , you might wan na reconsider .<ssssss>for we , we manage well and still have a good time relaxing .<ssssss>just do not meet that many foks.check out : very quick .<ssssss>check out at 1200 hr .<ssssss>on the bus within the hour .<ssssss>airport check-in do in about 30 mins.overall : we have a very good , relax honeymoon which be exactly what we want .<ssssss>however , i do not think we would go back to this resort .<ssssss>again , the issue of staff and clientele be very surprising to we and different from other resort we have visit where we have meet many different people .<ssssss>surprisingly , there be many , many kid at this resort which be not really indicate in the review .<ssssss>although kid be allow , we think that this be mostly a adult type resort .<ssssss>obviously , family be choose this resort more and more which be very ok as it be very a nice place.the resort itself be beautiful , service in most case be above average but some area as indicate above could be improved.hope this can help some of you in select you dream vacation .<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 4 2 2 3		minor grievance my dream be to visit paris .<ssssss>for my honeymoon , my husband and i decide to go to pari for 5 night and greece for two week .<ssssss>i decide to start my search for a hotel through trip advisory .<ssssss>even though this hotel be only a 3 star hotel , we decide that the review be too great to pass it up .<ssssss>i definitely want a superior room with a view of the eiffel tower .<ssssss>my french be not the greatest so a ask a dear friend who be parisian to call the hotel and find out how we can be guarantee a room with a view from the bedroom .<ssssss>she call and we follow they instruction when book we hotel .<ssssss>the reception assure we if we ask for a certain room in we booking , it would be give to we because we be book 8 month in advance .<ssssss>even after the hotel be book , we friend call the hotel to confirm we receive a room with a view .<ssssss>you can imagine we surprise when we do not receive this room .<ssssss>when we go down to the front desk they answer be that we must have misunderstand they when we book and a room with a view be not guarantee .<ssssss>i donâ€™t understand how one parisian can not understand another , there be no language barrier .<ssssss>other than the view , the room be o.k. and the area be great .<ssssss>most of the staff be helpful , yet if you have a complaint , do not expect much , there be a complete attitude change .<ssssss>i would recommend this hotel if it be just a family visit paris , but if it be a romantic getaway i would try somewhere else .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 5 4 5 5		all style , no substance i will preface this review by state that i be quite grouchy due to the fact that i have not be able to sleep for the past four night , so take these comment for what they be worth , but i be so horribly disappoint by this hotel that i have decide to write my first tripadvisor review as a rebuttal to all the glowing review that lead I to book here in the first place.as most people do , i will start with the positive , what little there is.this hotel ooze with style .<ssssss>from the lobby to the rooftop pool , everything be visually quite stunning .<ssssss>it be sophisticated and modern in a urban way that seem just right in such a stylish city .<ssssss>the room i be in have a beautiful wood floor , a lovely minimalist bathroom with slide glass door and slate tile floor , and the furnishings be very cleverly lay out so as to maximize space.the location be very convenient , walk distance from just about everything and the jaume i metro station be about a block away for what lie outside of walk distance .<ssssss>there be a organic supermarket down the street -lrb- and room in the minibar fridge to put thing -rrb- as well as cafe and bank and pharmacy - anything you would need .<ssssss>i will admit that i pick this hotel mainly for its location and i be not at all disappoint in that regard.the staff , too , at least the one i have encounter so far , have be nothing but friendly , helpful and gracious .<ssssss>nothing all that exceptional , but definitely everything you would hope for .<ssssss>i do not fault they one bit.howeverunderneath this sleek exterior be a whole wealth of aggravatingly poor design and planning .<ssssss>the bed , for example .<ssssss>it look beautiful the way they make it up and very invite after a arduous cross-atlantic flight .<ssssss>it be quite bouncy , good for jump , i would imagine , and i be seriously not at all picky about bed - i will happily dream away on the hardest of futon mattress - but i can actually feel the spring poke up through the skimpy cushioning and i can not fall asleep for more than a few hour without one of my limb fall asleep .<ssssss>this morning i notice a bruise on my hipbone from lie on one side for too long .<ssssss>my neck and shoulder ache something fierce and i now understand why they put little note card everywhere advertise in-room massage .<ssssss>after sleep on they bed , you will need one.my second major complaint : the lighting in the room .<ssssss>there be not enough of it .<ssssss>and what little there be be so infuriatingly poorly position it make I want to scream .<ssssss>in the lobby , the poor lighting feel moody and seem almost appropriate .<ssssss>but there be no excuse for what they have manage to do in the room .<ssssss>there be three recessed overhead light , one directly above -lrb- maybe slightly behind -rrb- the head of the bed , one directly above the sink and one above and slightly in front of the toilet .<ssssss>there be also a desk lamp on the desk , some sort of lighting inside the closet and a coil of christmas light behind the headboard that serve only to add atmosphere .<ssssss>that sound like enough , do not it ?<ssssss>well , the desk lamp be perfectly functional , i will not complain about it .<ssssss>and the atmospheric closet and bed light do what they set out to do well enough .<ssssss>but the light above the bed be point in such a way so as to blind you should you want to read in bed lie on you back and if you should try to turn over and lie on you stomach , it take some real effort to position yourself and the book in such a way that the page be illuminate .<ssssss>and it also somehow fail to sufficiently light the side of the room it be responsible for .<ssssss>the light over the sink also point straight down , cast shadow on the face , make it impossible to see in the mirror .<ssssss>i catch a reflection of myself in the mirror of a well-lit bathroom yesterday and i absolutely look like a clown , have apply too much blush and crooked eyeliner .<ssssss>and my boyfriend keep cut himself shave .<ssssss>the third overhead light , over the toilet be totally mysterious to I .<ssssss>it allow you to see the floor in front of you perfectly , and somehow fail to pour any of its light into the shower , make it the darkest single corner in the room .<ssssss>i simply do not understand it.speaking of the bathroom , it certainly look very pretty and modern and spotlessly clean .<ssssss>but if anyone anywhere in the hotel flush they toilet while you happen to be in the shower , the water turn scalding hot for a good 10 seconds .<ssssss>the showerhead be on one of those pole where you can slide it up and down to you desire height , which seem quite nice until you realize that there be no way to make the showerhead stay where you have put it and have to do a kind of dance in order to remain in the stream of water .<ssssss>and the shower have no door or curtain , only a panel of glass 2 or 3 foot wide that do nothing to prevent the entire bathroom from get wet.the wall be very thin and poorly soundproof and , even though i think i have book a executive room on a high floor with view over the city , i be instead lucky enough to be assign a -lrb- cheaper , smaller -rrb- room overlook a playground where child can be hear scream until well past midnight.i have a few other smaller complaint , like the food we order from room service late last night be pretty bad , though admittedly very prompt and convenient at 4 in the morning when we could not sleep , the air conditioner be rig so that it turn off when you leave the room , mean you always come back to a room that be hot and stuffy , and the rooftop pool , albeit totally picturesque , do not have nearly enough seat to accommodate the number of hotel guest who want to spend time there , and from what i can tell , all the seat be snag up early in the day by the middle-aged british tourist who sit there all day swill they wine and discuss they asset -lrb- i be not even be facetious - at the pool today i overheard two distinct group of people discuss they vast finances -rrb- and , at least for I , stand room only and people twice my age act half as mature make enjoy a glass of wine on the rooftop at sunset more or less impossible.i have not be to the gym yet , but i pass by it today and it look like all the equipment be brand new and , like the rest of the hotel , it be very clean .<ssssss>same go for the business center.in short , it seem to I that what you be pay for when you book a room at the grand hotel central be the decor , the location and the courteous staff .<ssssss>everyone and everything be nice and pretty .<ssssss>but take all that away and you be leave with a hotel i would not spend $ 60 a night to stay in , let alone 200 euro .<ssssss>this hotel have everything you could possibly desire , except for what be most important : bed you can sleep on , shower you can shower in and functional lighting - pretty serious oversight in my book .<ssssss>
1 -1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		avoid this hotel we visit new orlean frequently and have stay at a wide range of hotel in the downtown area .<ssssss>the astor crowne plaza be clearly the worst experience we have ever have in new orleans.first , there be continue problem with the electronic door lock throughout we six day stay .<ssssss>even though we have the key reprogram at least once a day , it be not until the fifth day when the front desk say they would send a maintenance person right away .<ssssss>they show up over a hour later -lrb- one guy working and three watch -rrb- and after spend a hour on the door , it be no better than before.second , the parking situation be extremely inconvenient , require you to ride a shuttle to a scary place near the project .<ssssss>the total time to the car be frequently 20-30 minutes.finally , the food be nondescript at best and my new orleans-born wife have the worst milk punch of she life .<ssssss>overall , there be far better choice in downtown new orlean<ssssss>
1 1 2 2 3 1 1 3		terrible experience we have stay at the hampton inn suite and have a terrible experience .<ssssss>the staff be extremely unfriendly , the room be not clean for a couple of day and the breakfast be just horrific .<ssssss>we be use to travel quite a lot internationally and be really not too picky or particular about place to stay .<ssssss>it really ruin we stay in boston .<ssssss>we have inform the manager of we complaint .<ssssss>there be not any respon until the day that we check out .<ssssss>it seem to be that the staff be rather discriminate .<ssssss>

3 5 3 5 3 2 3 4		ok for a stop over this hotel be very basic , but you get what you pay for and it be handy to the airport especially if you check in late and check out early .<ssssss>we have a bad experience checking in with the girl on reception , she be rather rude when i remind she we have request a early check in , but apart from that no problems.the food be rather good and reasonably price .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 3 1 1 1		terrilbe/non-existent management be the downfall of the hotel my wife and i have be to the domican republic several time before , and even get engage there , so i feel we have a good sense of what can be expect in this country .<ssssss>in fact , we have a soft spot for the dr. we be on a family trip this time , celebrate a aunt and uncle 25th anniversary with both we parent and sibling .<ssssss>the occidental have some positive , but overall we experience have so many negative aspect to it that i doubt we will ever return to the dominican .<ssssss>i will start with the positive : the hotel layout be nice , the staff do a good job of keep thing clean.the bartender do a admirable job of hustle despite the fact very few people tipthe late night pizza -lrb- available until 6 am -rrb- be surprisingly goodthe club mangu be by far the most happen club we have ever see in the dr sadly - on to the negativesthe first problem we encounter be with the quality of we room .<ssssss>we room have 2 twin bed push together -lrb- rather than a king which would be more appropriate for a married couple -rrb- , non functional ac , a non functional fan , and a shower that be better describe as a slow drip that alternate between ice cold and scaldingly hot .<ssssss>we be pretty miserable this first night , since neither the ac nor the fan work .<ssssss>we subsequently find out we have be allocate a non renovate room .<ssssss>the rest of we group have all be allocate renovate room .<ssssss>get move to a renovate room end up be a major challenge .<ssssss>we keep be inform a manager be not around and they could not move we without approval from one of they , finally , when a manager do arrive the nect morning , he try to stay back in he office and have the reception attendant try to pass message back and forth .<ssssss>it make we feel ridiculous .<ssssss>we insist on speak to the manager directly .<ssssss>he try to say the resort be full , which be a complete lie -lrb- later we find out they be at 60 % capacity -rrb- , and that no renovate room be available .<ssssss>this be after see many many people wheeling suitcase from all the different building all over the resort that morning to check out .<ssssss>finally , after 3 more trip to the reception culminate with ask for a meeting with the general manager , a renovate room finally magically appear for we .<ssssss>there really be no reason for the situation to get to this point , however .<ssssss>give there be 4 problem with we room and there be plenty of room available , we should have be move immediately .<ssssss>we experience with the management on this issue , or lack of since the manager be rarely available , be repeat in other scenario several time over the remainder of the trip.the staff often have a stop bother we , we be just chill attitude .<ssssss>for example , the day before we leave i be try to find out what time we bus would pick we up for the airport .<ssssss>i be inform i have to speak to the person that coordinate the bus , and that they be currently in the back of the lobby .<ssssss>i go to try to find they , they be not there .<ssssss>when i tell this to the rep at the front desk , i be tell they might be at the theatre now , but in any case would be around the property for a couple more hour and i should just wander around try to find they .<ssssss>this be pretty annoy the day before we have to leave , and i want to get back to the beach .<ssssss>i ask they to just find the person coordinate the bus themselves , or make a phone call to find out the bus time and just send a message to we room with the time .<ssssss>although this experience be not so terrible in its own right , i think it just show the pervasive attitude of the staff.there be a constant stream of people complain about various thing at the front desk , which create a negative atmosphere and quickly erode we confidence in how thing be be run .<ssssss>the food be not good .<ssssss>a consensus quickly emerge that the buffet be the best choice -lrb- as oppose to the specialty restaurant -rrb- .<ssssss>it be a interesting phenomenon to see all the restaurant nearly empty but a line out the door for the buffet .<ssssss>most of we have issue in the bathroom from the second day onward.the reception staff , and lack of constant manager presence , leave guest with the impression there be nobody to turn to about problem .<ssssss>a quick example here , i be work out in the fitness room one afternoon .<ssssss>the employee on duty approach I and ask I where i be from , after which he tell I that god be number one for he and ask where he rank for I .<ssssss>he then tell I he be a christian , etc. i be a bit at a loss at how to respond but i just smile and return to my workout .<ssssss>after this exchange he proceed to go to the corner of the fitness room and chant various prayer at the top of he voice i spiritu sankti , etc. this go on for the next 20 minute of my workout .<ssssss>after the earlier frustration at the front desk , i think if i tell they this story they would just laugh about they funny colleague , so i never ever bother to tell anybody about it .<ssssss>another negative be the quality of the nighttime entertainment .<ssssss>we actually have very low expectation from we previous trip .<ssssss>however , the occidental take thing to a new low .<ssssss>for example , one night the mc spend 45 minute play the i be thinking of a number between 75 and 95 game and then 120 - 140 after the first one be guess and so on and so on .<ssssss>we have a problem with the staff ignore the do not disturb sign .<ssssss>twice , they walk on on we take a nap.a final issue i will discuss be not completely the hotel fault , although they play a role .<ssssss>we ask at the concierge how we could book deep sea fishing .<ssssss>they recommend a company .<ssssss>we speak to the owner in person and arrange a very specific deal .<ssssss>we want to keep all the fish we catch , have it clean by the staff and then have it cook at a local restaurant .<ssssss>he quote a price for this type of package , and tell we that a friend of he that own a restaurant have agree to cook the fish as a favor as long as we buy drink and side order from he restaurant .<ssssss>we go out and catch 2 large mahus mahi that we take back to shore after which we have a series of unpleasant episode .<ssssss>first , the boat staff tell we they usually get to keep the fish , or at least one fish .<ssssss>so we have to argue about the fact we already have agree with the owner to keep all the fish .<ssssss>then , none of the staff want to clean the fish without additional tip , although we have already discuss this point with the owner as well .<ssssss>finally , the restaurant owner tell we he would not cook the fish unless he get to keep all the extra fish we could not eat on the spot -lrb- this be no good because we promise cook fish to we wife and girlfriend -rrb- .<ssssss>so it make we feel like everybody be constantly try to scam we and take a piece out of we on every possible chance .<ssssss>we finally get the fish cook at another small local place nearby for a reasonable sum , but we should not have have to pay anything more since we have be very exact in we negotiation .<ssssss>the owner of the boat be not available for all this time for anybody to call .<ssssss>despite for success of the trip in term of the fish , we actually return really bum out about the dr since we feel everybody be try to scam we .<ssssss>we resolve not to leave the resort for any other trip .<ssssss>i would really suggest avoid leave the resort .<ssssss>finally , it actually end up be a funny joke to we , but the staff manage to incorrectly spell happy 25th anniversary on the cake we order for my aunt and uncle !<ssssss>to conclude , i would just avoid the occidental .<ssssss>in order to improve matter at the property , i think they would have to completely overhaul the management and rethink how they organize everything at the hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 3 2 4 3 3 1		okay if you smoke , have no luggage , no car , and do not watch tv this be the third place i have stay in in the same building at 56 via faenza since 1974 .<ssssss>also probably the first time i have stay in a hotel room without a television , which i must admit i really miss .<ssssss>the furniture in the double -lrb- show in numerous photo -rrb- be very nice - a nice firm bed , and the bathroom be very high quality for a one-star hotel .<ssssss>the entire place reek of cigarette smoke , although smoking be prohibit .<ssssss>the smell drive I crazy .<ssssss>we stay here because frommer recommend it and it be near my son 's apartment .<ssssss>i would have prefer to pay a bit more to stay at a three-star hotel .<ssssss>we pay 140 euro for two night -lrb- total -rrb- plus another 46 euro to garage we car .<ssssss>i do not think the long climb to get up 4 flight would be so arduous but i must admit it be a bit of a drag .<ssssss>all-in-all , not a good value , and i would certainly not stay here again .<ssssss>frommer 's really need to review they research every 20 year or so .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 4 5 5 5		friendly staff but overprice and noisy we choose this hotel base on the excellent recommendation at tripadvisor .<ssssss>we stay one night and we overall impression be that the place be somewhat overrated .<ssssss>we get a room on the road side and it be terrible noisy .<ssssss>also , there be a building site vis-Ã -vi the hotel and they start work early in the morning .<ssssss>the price we pay for we room be definitely too much due to these circumstance - not very good value for money .<ssssss>if you be go to stay here , ask for a room to the inner courtyard .<ssssss>however , the staff be friendly and helpful , and the complimentary breakfast be very good .<ssssss>there be also a very good french restaurant nearby and the beach be close .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 4 3		great location my family stay at the monteleone last summer .<ssssss>the hotel be fabulous !!<ssssss>so far my favorite in new orlean .<ssssss>the location be perfect and the room be spacious and beautifully decorate .<ssssss>most of the staff be extremely friendly , the only problem we have be at check-in , i feel the lady at the front desk could have be a bit more courteous .<ssssss>all in all we love this hotel and will stay there again .<ssssss>
4 3 3 2 5 4 4 -1		excellent hotel in need of refurbishment the building be nice even if a bit outside of the action .<ssssss>the doorman be always at hand and friendly .<ssssss>check-in - seat - be prompt and courteous .<ssssss>most , not to say all , the staff member be nice and ready to help .<ssssss>the room , actually a executive suite , be nicely furnish as be the bathroom .<ssssss>the overall feel be really nice but it lack modern amenity for a hotel of this class : mp3 dock , flat screen in all room , fresh flower , welcome amenity like chocolate .<ssssss>at more than 5000 â‚?per night , one would expect this kind of extra luxury the amstel never provide despite this stay be my third stay .<ssssss>overall a good and reliable option at a cost .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 2 -1		enjoyable stay - nice hotel , great location we only spend a short period of time at the peninsula beij however we thoroughly enjoy it .<ssssss>we stay in a duplex suite as the room be located on the top floor with city view .<ssssss>we have notice that the other room be quite small in size , and we also notice from picture post on trip advisor that some of the room be directly face another building - we definately want to avoid get this type of view!the suite be really nice though still quite small compare to other hotel suite .<ssssss>when we check in , the staff at the main reception be not very friendly however thankfully they be not the people to check we in - they take we to the club lounge floor check in .<ssssss>the staff here be slightly more friendlier and professional - they offer we a drink and quickly check we in .<ssssss>we be escort to we room which just have beautiful fresh rose place in the lounge and also upstairs in we bedroom .<ssssss>we be also give a large fruit platter -lrb- lot of chinese fruit that we have not taste before , it be great to experience they local produce -rrb- .<ssssss>we escort be really nice and show we around the room - we ceiling to wall window offer great view of the city -lrb- we escort state ' the best view in the city ' -rrb- .<ssssss>the bathroom be quite small though beautifully present - all marble and have a television over the bath .<ssssss>both floor be nicely furnish and very modern - more importantly , comfortable.the club lounge benefit be very good - they offer buffet breakfast , afternoon tea and pre dinner drinks/snacks .<ssssss>we actually have the breakfast at jing instead of the club lounge -lrb- they give the option of take breakfast at either jing or the lounge - l would definately recommend jing - so much better ! -rrb-<ssssss>great breakfast , everything you could want for breakfast be available , it be fresh and it be all delicious .<ssssss>for afternoon tea , they offer coffees/teas and biscuit , fine chocolate , sandwich , scone etc - good variety .<ssssss>the evening drink be also pretty good - they offer warm snack and a variety of wine and spirit .<ssssss>if you be stay at this hotel , l would recomm take advantage the club lounge - it be worth the extra cost .<ssssss>the only fault with the club lounge be the staff - they be not very friendly or attentive and they look very bored and disinterested - actually , all the peninsula staff do not offer the kind of service you would expect from a five star hotel ... the best thing about this hotel be it be location , it be close to the main tourist attraction and around the corner from the main shopping street a night street market .<ssssss>also another great thing about hotel be jing restaurant - the breakfast be great however the dinner be absolutely scrumptious-definately the best food l have ever taste !<ssssss>the peking duck be amazing , not to be miss !<ssssss>overall , l would stay at this hotel again - great location , fantastic food , nice hotel however staff service could be better .<ssssss>
4 5 5 3 4 1 2 3		better than average ... but not the ritz my first stay at zaza .<ssssss>nicer semi-upscale property .<ssssss>get a great rate -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- make it a no-brainer .<ssssss>like many of the hotel in this genre , lot of investment in try to make it hip and boutique feeling ... but the service never live up to expectation .<ssssss>take them15 + minute to get I checked-in .<ssssss>only one person work the desk and line of 3 people in front of I .<ssssss>same in the lounge where the bartender could barely find the inspiration to pour a guy a libation .<ssssss>my room be great .<ssssss>high quality finish and touch .<ssssss>lovedthe artwork all over the place .<ssssss>will likely be back assume i can continue to get good rate .<ssssss>

1 1 1 4 2 3 2 1		warning : do not stay here !<ssssss>this be a dump .<ssssss>spend the extra money to stay at the hilton .<ssssss>it be really not worth spend you money on this place .<ssssss>i do not get any sleep since the room be so muggy and i could not open my window since it be on a fire escape .<ssssss>i almost eat one night stay to stay at another hotel it be so bad .<ssssss>definitely not worth a dime .<ssssss>i would say this be a 1-2 star hotel .<ssssss>a quality suite or motel 6 be better !<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 5 5 5 -1		nice staff , great beach but food just ok ... let I first start by say that some people be just plain ridiculous !!!<ssssss>i just get back from the riu bambu and before go be very nervous due to such negative review on this site.i read over and over again that no one speak english ... what hotel be these people stay at ?<ssssss>every person i talk with except for gardner and maid speak very good english along with french and german as well .<ssssss>the staff at this hotel be extremely friendly and go out of they way to make you as comfortable as possible at all times.i be a travel agent and therefore have travel to many destination and many kind of hotel .<ssssss>do i think this hotel be a 5 star no ... but it be definitely a 4 star for sure.the food and the air conditioning be my biggest concern while there .<ssssss>the food taste good but i be very surprise by how small a selection they have everyday in the buffet .<ssssss>and the fact that there be no air conditioning in the main buffet be a problem as due to the ceiling be so high you can not feel the breeze from the ceiling fan and therefore it be unbearably hot on some nights.other than those two thing everything else be fabulous.the entertainment team be awesome , especially sexybelly , coochie and evelyn .<ssssss>every night these people dance they butt off for unapprecaitive tourist and keep a smile on they face while they do it !!<ssssss>it would be nice if people realize just how hard these people work for very little money .<ssssss>overall i have a excellent time meet some great people and hang out on a amazing beach what else could you ask for ?<ssssss>i would go back no problem as long as you do not go expect to be spoil rotten like you be at a sandal or something you will have a great time !!<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 5 4 -1 -1		close but no cigar it be a really cute concept , but it kind of fail upon execution ... my door key card let I into someone else 's room -lrb- my fault ... it be late at night and i be not pay attention to the room numbering -rrb- - they be understandably annoyed and i be freak out.the shower head holder be break , so water spray everywhere .<ssssss>not good when it take the better part of 5 minute for the water to heat up.room be also kind of noisy - lot of sound from some sort of aircondition unit outside the window .<ssssss>although breakfast be great , i do not think i will be come back .<ssssss>
2 1 1 2 1 3 3 1		hotel be from the brady bunch era stay there for a convention.hotel be old and for the most part unrenovated we room which be a suite have filthy carpet peel paint and mold paint over .<ssssss>they have no beach except at low tide and then its about 8 ftbut they be a beach at other hotel so you just walk there.pools be very small but clean the hotel staff do try very hard and the resturant on the 31 st fl.is very good .<ssssss>i would probably be more negative but this be a free trip have i have to pay for it i would have be screaming.not the true hi exp.like manhattan with a beach<ssssss>
2 1 1 4 2 3 2 2		way behind the competition !<ssssss>we stay at 4 -lrb- 4 and 5 star -rrb- hotel whilst in bali and as a hyatt gold passport holder we find it not just lack against bali standard it be lack against the hyatt service standard as well .<ssssss>not only be the hotel scream to be renovate it be the small thing that continuously let in downwe actually treat ourselves at the hyatt and opt for a suite over the new year period and although in its day i be sure it be a splender it be have never be update .<ssssss>the wall still have the original cement render pattern that be very popular way back when and floor tiling not only in the bathroom but in the entire suite be cry to be regrout .<ssssss>the 3 mouse trap of a cardboard square , oil and dry fish -lrb- dont worry they where check daily ! -rrb-<ssssss>be of great amusement and to be honest if we hadnt prepay we would have check out and find elsewhere .<ssssss>i have to say there definitely be no damp smell within the suite and the aircon work well - however i can see how it could be a issue as there be a strong damp smell when walk through certain area of the hotel.within 3 hour of check-in we have a strange phonecall from a local with a make up story about have already drive for we at the airport on the 24th of dec -lrb- quite suspicious as consider we arrive on the 19th and have transport through the intercontinental -rrb- ask if he service where need -lrb- again ?? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>he have we full name and room number and after a little bit of research i be sure we detail have be pass out from a hyatt staff member .<ssssss>the irony of this be that we have suit make from a well know and reputable tailor in which the hyatt not only refuse to put they phonecall through they also fail to pass on the message !!!<ssssss>the regency club staff where great and pre-dinner drink in the club be a casual but lovely affair , breakfast itself in the club be good however the first morning order be take and forget - genuine mistake and forgive however this set the pattern of those little thing build up to become a genuine complaint.the pizza ria be great and end up eat there 3 time however they do mess up the order and give my pizza to another table in which i have to wait a extra 15 minute whilst my partner be eat he , the other visit in the restaurant where a extra ingredient be request be also never follow through .<ssssss>the main breakfast area have a great buffet with chef on hand to cook egg to you liking , take note though make sure someone stay at the table at all time because you will lose it .<ssssss>in the space of pop up to grab a pastry -lrb- another coffee be on order -rrb- we table be be clean for reseat -lrb- 3 people clean with people wait to be sit down -rrb- .<ssssss>as you can see the little thing be start to build up.we have room service which arrive promptly and hot however the request side condiment do not arrive at all - forgivable ... .<ssssss>absolutely as it do happen and normally would not even suffice a mention in any review however due to the constant mishap it definitely land on the radar with we this time.even check out be not a smooth affair , with the pattern of mistake occur and now we distrust of bali hyatt attention to detail we decide to request a itemised bill early to ensure that it be correct , and yep you guess it ... there where charge on the bill that have come from another room .<ssssss>once the hyatt staff request the invoice copy from room service the mistake be acknowledge and rectify -lrb- the process do take just under 45 minute though -rrb- .<ssssss>overall though we love sanur and will seek to stay in the area again - just not at the hyatt !<ssssss>

we fill out these form , get into yet another line , pc immigration , where they stamp we passport and head out to get we luggage , but before you get just a couple of step , you be ask for the form you just fill out .<ssssss>no big deal , but very unorganized .<ssssss>why you cant just hand they $ 10 each be beyond I , lol .<ssssss>luggage come right off the carousel , we grab one of the luggage cart and load all of we stuff and attempt to leave the luggage area .<ssssss>we get about ten step before we be stop .<ssssss>no one speak any english , but apparantly we can not bring we own luggage outside , and especially on the cart , so they take off we luggage , put it on they own cart and herd we outside .<ssssss>we tell the man we need a taxi van and we be lead thru the parking lot .<ssssss>we luggage get load and for $ 28 , off we go .<ssssss>the trip there be a eye opener .<ssssss>we see many moped with more than two people on they , which be a hoot , extreme poverty and the taxi driver pass each other right and leave .<ssssss>it be shall we say ... interesting , lol.we arrive at the resort after approx 45 minute and hubbie go to check we in .<ssssss>he soon beckon I into the reception area .<ssssss>the receptionist and everyone behind the desk do not speak english .<ssssss>usually , in the past , i have just give my name , and the reservation be find .<ssssss>this be not the case , i have to give they my copy of expedia 's reservation , which they keep by the way , so if you need yours , take two copy .<ssssss>check in be approx half a hour .<ssssss>they be confuse that we have five people , but two room .<ssssss>we understand that later , when we see five and six people to a room , all over .<ssssss>we finally get we room card and pool card -lrb- one per person although they do not want to give we one for we daughhter , more on that later -rrb- we walk to we room after grab a drink .<ssssss>again , check in be no big deal , just a lengthy process .<ssssss>the lobby be open air and beautifl .<ssssss>we could not wait to get we wristband so we could get we first drink.we get the room i have previously request .<ssssss>build five , room 6120 and 6108 .<ssssss>first floor .<ssssss>we do not get a pool view , but the view to the other resort wasnt bad , and there be still alot of palm tree , so it be just fine .<ssssss>this could have be a complaint for some people , but hey we get two out of three request and we be on vacation on a tropical island .<ssssss>so far so good!we have two queen bed and a sofa/bed that my daughter immediately take over , as it be just she size .<ssssss>furniture be in fine condition .<ssssss>i be surprise at how many we tv station we get , all the major station plus some smaller one , which be a unexpected surprise .<ssssss>the bathroom be all marble .<ssssss>yes , the shower door may not close 100 % completely , but really be not a big deal .<ssssss>the adjustable shower head be great , especially with a sunburn and do not want a direct hard spray of water on you .<ssssss>we never have a issue with water but my father room only get hot shower water when both sink faucet and the tub faucet be on , lol .<ssssss>the fan in we room be not on and we could not get they on , but the maid figure they out , so that become a non issue .<ssssss>yes , the room be absolutely musty smell and definately damp at all time , what be you go to do ?<ssssss>i guess if you never open the slider and keep the air on , it would be better , but i love the ocean breeze , so everytime we be in the room , we keep the slider open .<ssssss>both of the slide glass door would move , so it be sometimes tricky to get the lock pin thru both door , but once you know the trick , even my 9 yr old could do it immediately .<ssssss>we have beatiful wicker chair and table on the patio , which be nice.in we room , we have a bottle of rum , a bottle of vermouth -lrb- ?? -rrb-<ssssss>, two bottle of wine , red and white , five small bottle of presidente beer , five water bottle , two large pepsi 's and two large sprite 's .<ssssss>my father 's room do not have the liquor , so we figure the person who stay in we room before we , must have be on the deluxe plan and leave they stuff , as oppose to we jr. suite plan .<ssssss>the room be identical , it be just the amenity that be different .<ssssss>we tip the maid three to five buck every day and receive four packet of coffee , six or more water , pop and beer replenish , clean towel twice a day , etc. my father have flower petal almost daily in he room , on the bed and in the bathroom , but we never see that.the courtyard for each building be different , most with beautiful water feature , it be definately a nice walk to see they all .<ssssss>in the lobby of each building be a concierge desk .<ssssss>i have read review that say this be where we make dinner reservation , and we try to do this , but again , the woman speak no english , and only point to the elite sign .<ssssss>after six night i still have no idea what a elite member be , perhaps the people that own timeshare there ?<ssssss>we eat at the buffet the first night .<ssssss>until the last morning , we never have a problem find a table for five , set up with glass , silverware and napkin .<ssssss>the food be fine .<ssssss>not the best , not the worst , and there be something for everyone .<ssssss>with the number of people they have to serve , and from so many different place , the selection be fine .<ssssss>now , the service on the other hand be completely touch and go .<ssssss>sometimes a server would come over and ask for drink order .<ssssss>typically we would order water and pop right away , before even get up for the buffet .<ssssss>there be many time we would ask several time before get serve and sometimes we would get the water immediately and sometimes never .<ssssss>they move at they own pace and do they own thing , and there appear to be no rhyme or reason .<ssssss>we find the easiest way to get around we thirst be to go and get fresh juice from the buffet , which by the way be awesome !<ssssss>they have banana , watermelon , papaya , pear , etc. breakfast , lunch and dinner daily be all the same , food and service.one annonying thing i thuoght i would mention .<ssssss>they have people stand in the lobby of the buffet welcome you .<ssssss>you think it be just that right ?<ssssss>employee welcome you to the restaurant .<ssssss>but no , it be timeshare hawker who will bother you on the way out .<ssssss>i think that really unfair .<ssssss>i have to deal with they all week at the beach , pool and lobby , so to hit I up inside the restaurant i just feel be a sleazy tactic.we eat at several of the restaurant for diner , by far the nicest one be the one we pay extra for , el bodegon .<ssssss>we have great wine and great steak there .<ssssss>it also be never full , when we be there only four other table be full and we have great conversation with the other people .<ssssss>we never get into the italian rest .<ssssss>after numerous try , the wait be just ridiculous .<ssssss>we talk to some people who wait three hour and never get sit , go back two day in a row , and never be able to get a seat .<ssssss>the buffet and rest by the beach be awesome for both lunch and dinner .<ssssss>for lunch , you could be in a bathing suit and bare foot , but for dinner the whole atmostphere change , nice linen , pants and shoe have to be wear , etc. the coffee/pastry shop be awesome for after dinner drink and desert .<ssssss>the mexican food look horrible , but taste great .<ssssss>the american place wak pretty good .<ssssss>we be never up past nine or ten so never make it to a show or to the disco .<ssssss>we be just plum wear out , lol.the lobby bar be nice and always crowd , after dinner .<ssssss>the live music be a nice touch , although we still can not figure out at a dominican resort , with a small percentage of american traveller , why they choose to sing many 70 's we ballad .<ssssss>although listen to they sing they version of we old song bring many smiles.we mostly live at the pool .<ssssss>i be one of the first people up for the day .<ssssss>so it be always interesting to watch other wake up , still in they pajamas come and stake out they chair .<ssssss>one minute there be only a couple of people mill about , and the next it be like a bunch of ant , move here and there , set up they chair with towel , move the heavy umbrella around and then leave again .<ssssss>it really be pretty humerous .<ssssss>i see no one fight over chair or even remove anyone 's stuff , but then again , the first five day of we trip , there be not a ton of people there .<ssssss>the last night , friday , several bus come in , because the place be pack !<ssssss>you would walk past a room , and there would be a family of six staying in there .<ssssss>i do not know how anyone do that , with one bathroom .<ssssss>i do want to mention how my daughter be treat .<ssssss>as i mention earlier , they do not want to give I a towel card for she until i ask .<ssssss>at every meal , they would take we drink order , but never hers , and they would start to walk away and we would have to stop they to add she drink order to ours .<ssssss>at the nicer restaurant , she would not get a menu , etc. it be not like she be four , she be nine and still , they would just completely ignore she .<ssssss>i pay for she , just as i pay for we , she be not stay there free .<ssssss>again , not a huge deal , but something worth mentioning.the pool bar be where we spend the majority of we time .<ssssss>we meet a ton of great people .<ssssss>the first four or five day it be mostly american and canadian and we definately put a dent in they liqour inventory , lol .<ssssss>it be while talk to those people , that you learn where to go to eat , what excursion to go on or not , etc , because get info anywhere else be downright impossible .<ssssss>there be daily resort activity sheet print out , but never hand out and unless you go all the way upfront to the lobby , you never would know what be go on for the day .<ssssss>for example , rock climbing , which my daughter be so look forward to be only available twice a day at certain time for 15 minute , and we never make it .<ssssss>we arrive once in time , but the bottom of she shorts be wet from walk on the beach and she wasnt allow to go .<ssssss>they do have two employee walk around and take some great picture which be available in the lobby for $ 7 we later in the day .<ssssss>they also would have different animal to take pic with , such as a monkey one day , colorful parrot the next , beautiful white bird the next , so the kid all love that .<ssssss>reservation be a mess .<ssssss>i have read you have to make daily reservation at the restaurant .<ssssss>so the first morning hubbie and my father attempt to do this and just keep be tell to go somewhere else .<ssssss>no one talk to anyone else or know what to do outside of they little area .<ssssss>we end up make reservation that first night , but never need they from they on .<ssssss>but try to get this info be hard .<ssssss>for example , when we first arrive and unpacked and go exporing , i ask the pool bartender where the pool shack be .<ssssss>she literally have no idea and want to call housekeeping for we .<ssssss>now , i know that there be a building where you get you towel and then have to return they , but she have no idea .<ssssss>of course , it be right across from the pool , on the beach .<ssssss>when you ask where the bathroom be el bano ?<ssssss>you would just get a question look and it would be another guest that would tell you .<ssssss>ask where to make restaurant reservation , and one person would tell you you do not need reservation and another would tell you to go to the front desk , the front desk would tell you to go here , and then there , etc.it be those little thing that hubbie and i be talk about one night , sit outside on ` restaurant row ' have a drink .<ssssss>they label this resort as a 4.5 star .<ssssss>personally i would give it a 3.5 , but it would not take that much to make it a five star .<ssssss>they have everything in place .<ssssss>they have the pool , they have the swim up bar , they have the nice room , they have the spa , they have the activity , etc. but they have no communication .<ssssss>i dont want this to come out as i be a elitist or spoil but , they really need to have some of they employee be at least trilingual , spanish , english , maybe french , perhaps german .<ssssss>i dont know , its hard with this many people speak different language travel , but when the employee only speak spanish , it can make thing difficult .<ssssss>i have a rudimentary knowledge of spanish , but i can get by , not gracefully by any means , but i can get my thought across .<ssssss>and yes , i know that i be in a foreign country , yada yada , but as i mention i have travel extensively .<ssssss>i be not say that everyone , or even many or most of the employee need to speak english , but someone at the front desk should , and someone who answer the phone should .<ssssss>it be a joke that yes , there be indeed room service , but only if you speak spanish .<ssssss>i mention earlier that we have beer and wine in we room , but could not open they because we have no wine or bottle opener .<ssssss>i try call guest service to see if anyone could bring I one , and be transfer all over and be finally tell by someone that one would be bring right away .<ssssss>we be still wait , lol , and obviously buy we own from the gift shop .<ssssss>again , absolutely not a big deal but if you have a bottle of wine , perhaps just know where to get a bottle opener would be nice.all four adult have hour long massage on the beach with angela , for $ 55 each , and it be absolutely heaven on earth .<ssssss>she come around the pool area and be take reservation right then and there for the week .<ssssss>we each tip she ten buck and highly recommend it.hubbie and dad go on a deep sea fishing excursion .<ssssss>hubbie catch the first one .<ssssss>there be 7 guest on board and the boat come in with twelve mahus mahi 's and one other huge fish , so it be a huge success and they be both still rave about it .<ssssss>i will post pic when i can.we talk to the resort excursion people at the beach building about parasailing .<ssssss>we be tell $ 89 for twelve minute for two and no one could go and watch .<ssssss>i be down at the water edge when the ferry guy come up to pick people up for parasailing and he ask I if i want to go and i ask the price .<ssssss>we end up pay $ 70 for two people to go parasailing for 15 minute and three of we get to go and watch for free .<ssssss>so talk to the boat ferry people !<ssssss>we pay alot less for the exact same thing , same boat , same people.there be a marketplace right next to ob , which be awesome .<ssssss>talk to tony , three stall down and in the back , for great price on artwork .<ssssss>we bring three huge gorgeous peice home .<ssssss>dad bring two .<ssssss>i wonder who will get theirs hung first , lol.we do have to visit the medical building .<ssssss>my father have huge painful blister , and my step mom just want gauze and band aid for he .<ssssss>the doctor absolutely refuse and want to see he twice a day , every day for $ 50 each visit .<ssssss>she end up talk to guest service after go to the front desk and they order what she need from the pharmacy , have it deliver for $ 10 .<ssssss>there be a woman at the medical office while she be there who twist she ankle .<ssssss>they would ` nt let she get into the ambulance until she pay both the doctor 's bill and ambulance fee in advance -lrb- 250 we -rrb- .<ssssss>so , just as a precaution , bring bandaid , antiseptic , gauze just in case.the trip home be completely uneventful .<ssssss>i do want to mention however , that depart from punta cana be nothing like arrive .<ssssss>you would think you be at two completely different airport .<ssssss>arrive be all open air building and complete chaos .<ssssss>depart , be all organize line , air condition room , comfy chair , nice store and eat place , etc. night and day .<ssssss>we pay no depart tax , by the way , so i do not know what be up with that .<ssssss>you be tell by everyone to get there at least two hour in advance .<ssssss>there be no need for that , but do allow time for traffic or something.so in summary , we absolutely love this resort , we have very few problem or issue , and those we do have , we choose not to make they a big deal .<ssssss>yes , we safe would ' t open , but we get it fixx , yes we hear from other that thing in they room do not work , but all in all , i think it be great .<ssssss>would we go back ?<ssssss>probably not , but we rarely if ever go back to the same place twice .<ssssss>the water be pretty wavy for I .<ssssss>can i complain about that ?<ssssss>of course not .<ssssss>i much prefer calmer water like aruba , which of course be we ultimate favorite .<ssssss>will i recommend punta cana and ocean blue ?<ssssss>absolutely !<ssssss>i can not tell you how many people we talk to that go to punta cana every year , that be how beautiful it be .<ssssss>you can tell by all the construction this be go to be a huge travel destination in the very near future .<ssssss>so take advantage of the travel deal to be have .<ssssss>i hope you enjoy this honest review .<ssssss>if you have any question , feel free to contact I at kelly@ktrainor.com<ssssss>
4 4 2 4 5 5 5 3		beautiful grounds , friendly staff we find the ocean blue resort to be a good value .<ssssss>the grounds be meticulously clean and beautifully landscaped .<ssssss>the room be a bit worn and in need of update , but who stay in the room anyway ?<ssssss>when we arrive at we room , we find that one room have no light bulb , two room have safe that do not lock , and another room have water drip into the tub from the overhead light fixture and the telephone do not work .<ssssss>we call the registration desk about all of these issue , and they be resolve the follow morning by courteous staff .<ssssss>the morning , lunch and evening buffet be all good , especially the grilled lobster tail on christmas eve .<ssssss>we find the italian restaurant to be quite good and eat there twice , with salmon grilled to perfection .<ssssss>we spend most evening in the lobby bar area , which have a wonderful breeze 24/7 .<ssssss>the evening entertainment in the lobby be good , although we do tire of the caribbean music day after day .<ssssss>we be treat to some rock 'n roll music on christmas eve and have a blast with -lrb- almost -rrb- everyone in the bar dancing into the night .<ssssss>i read a review about the excursion be horrible .<ssssss>we enjoy the two excursion we book and feel that the price be well worth it .<ssssss>we go on the sanoa island excursion and love it .<ssssss>the speed boat ride there be cramped but we guide be a hoot and make the trip fun .<ssssss>the sanoa iisland beach be beautiful .<ssssss>lunch be serve just off the beach , and i be glad to see that it be serve in a sanitary manner -lrb- with no fly ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>all member in we group think the bbq and side dish be quite good .<ssssss>the catamaran sail back to the mainland be great fun with music , dancing , beautiful water and beautiful scenery .<ssssss>i do not know how anyone could not like this excursion .<ssssss>we also book the zip line excursion .<ssssss>this be a brand new facility in the mountain that be nicely landscape .<ssssss>the zip line staff be friendly , thorough , and safe .<ssssss>be aware that one must climb up quite a few stair to the platform to access the zip line .<ssssss>if you can not do stair , this be not for you .<ssssss>the platform be very sturdy and well build .<ssssss>this be good , clean fun .<ssssss>i do not recall what the minimum age/size requirement be for child , but i be sure there be one .<ssssss>the ride to get to the zip line facility be a tour in and of itself .<ssssss>you be in a open air vehicle and be able to view the interesting plant life/flowers/cocoa tree , etc. as the vehicle slowly climb its way up the mountain to the zip line facility .<ssssss>i believe the safari tour take at least part of this route , so be aware of this if you be plan on do both the safari tour and the zip line as you may be see a lot of the same thing .<ssssss>if you be interested in a deep sea fishing excursion , you will probably want to check into this soon after you arrival .<ssssss>we wait until wednesday before inquire about this excursion and there be no availability .<ssssss>we usually prefer sit at the beach , but one or two day it be so windy at the beach that we retreat to the pool .<ssssss>the pool be large and clean .<ssssss>a few time we find it a challenge to find enough empty beach lounge to accommodate four people .<ssssss>some guest reserve they lounge in the morning by place towel on the lounge chair , and then you do not see anyone actually sit in the lounge for hour on end or even for the entire day .<ssssss>the staff be great about pick up empty glass etc. and keep the pool area tidy .<ssssss>overall , i be impressed most by the friendly and courteous staff .<ssssss>the local who work in the resort embrace the tourist -lrb- unlike jamaica -rrb- .<ssssss>please remember to tip the staff .<ssssss>yes , it be a all inclusive , but keep in mind that they wages be low and they cost of living be high .<ssssss>they work they you-know-what off to keep we in non-stop food , drink , and clean sheet ... and they provide it all with a sincere smile .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 4 5 5 3		sweet staff , lot of little kid the lowdown : this place be huge .<ssssss>it be a little overwhelming , actually .<ssssss>there be a two or three shallow swimming pool -lrb- no deep end -rrb- and then a water park consist of three slide and a lazy river for a additional fee .<ssssss>to get to the beach , you need to wait for the ferry that will take you on a 10 minute ride to a private island that be own by the hotel .<ssssss>it be open from 9 to 5 and have one restaurant that serve bar food for lunch .<ssssss>to get to the ferry , you need to take a elevator down to a funicular ride , and hope you have time it so that the ferry be not just pull away as you get there .<ssssss>all of this mean that from slapping on you bikini to flop on you towel could take you a hour.the good : the staff be fantastically friendly .<ssssss>the food be pretty good .<ssssss>try the key lime pie , it be to die for , in fact , i order it via room service at midnight , and it arrive so promptly .<ssssss>the view be amazing !<ssssss>the water park be fun , and a neat addition .<ssssss>there be ton of activity to do on the premise -lrb- kayaking , snorkeling , scuba diving , ocean swimming , pool swimming , nightly movie , jet ski , banana boat , golf , tennis , etc. -rrb- and the front desk can hook you up with other tour nearby .<ssssss>the beach island have iguana , rabbit , tiny lizard and rooster .<ssssss>there be also a horse tour that look fun , although i do not go .<ssssss>the hiking be great , too , so if you be with people who lay around on the beach but you really want to get up and go , you can do both without have to separate all day long .<ssssss>that be pretty nice .<ssssss>the water be clean and clear , but there be sharp coral that bruise my foot .<ssssss>it be fun to collect though .<ssssss>i also find a conch in it be shell , and that be cool -lrb- be careful ; one of the local wander over as i be show a group of kid how cool we new friend be and talk about how she be go to use it when i be finish for soup .<ssssss>i set he free when she be not look , to the delight of the little kid who be sad when she talk about cook he and when she boyfriend talk about eat he raw . -rrb-<ssssss>my niece see a manatee -lrb- we be all still jealous we miss it -rrb- , and we whole family be greet by a humming bird flit around the bush we be sit by .<ssssss>the bad : even think the hotel be not crowd , service in the restaurant and on the hotel 's beach island be beyond slow .<ssssss>in the italian restaurant we wait over a hour before we appetizer arrive , and i watch other people leave in disgust after wait so long .<ssssss>we have a bad experience with we biolumninescent tour ; it be nearly a mile of kayacking and be nearly impossible for my 60 something mother in law and 9 year old nephew to keep up with , even though we be tell it be appropriate for all age .<ssssss>everyone in between -lrb- my husband and i , 26 , and 27 and he sibling and older niece and nephew -rrb- be just fine , as be all the other people in we group who be in the 16-50 range .<ssssss>this tour be book through the hotel for $ 90 per person , but if you just go to the dock where they leave from , you can book on the spot for around $ 45 .<ssssss>there be several company that offer tour of this really cool glow-in-the-dark bay , so if you be a small group , this be probably a good option .<ssssss>-lrb- go out the small white gate by where you catch the ferry , past the apartment , through a kind of sketchy area that just look abandon but be totally fine ; there be park car , and just walk a bit .<ssssss>you will stumble across several tourist snap into life vest get ready to go around 6 , 6:30 and later .<ssssss>def .<ssssss>check out those bioluminescent water .<ssssss>it be pretty awesome . -rrb-<ssssss>the worst for I be the hottub , which we nickname bubble tub because they be not hot at all .<ssssss>it be pretty disappointing .<ssssss>the water park be a extra charge , which be ridiculous consider what it be and what you be pay for everything else .<ssssss>it would be nice if it be free .<ssssss>there be plenty of room for adult to lounge pool side at the water park and there be a large shallow pool for the tiny kiddo , with a tiny kiddo waterslide , too .<ssssss>it would be great to get the family there and have the pool and hot tub consist of mostly adult .<ssssss>-lrb- we have a theory they keep the hot tub so cool to be kid-friendly -rrb- .<ssssss>the place be large which be cool , but i find this to be overwhelming and annoying , too .<ssssss>it be also overrun with little kid -lrb- the week between christmas and new year , though , mean little kid everywhere . -rrb-<ssssss>we be a group aged 9 - 65 -lrb- ten of we -rrb- , but i think we still would have prefer a older crowd .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 5 3 4 2		perfect retreat we book this holiday with first choice and we want 2 week of relaxation do not alot .<ssssss>we have never fly with first choice before and i have to say they be simply supurb for a charter flight in fact better than alot of lead airline .<ssssss>we arrive at the hotel in the afternoon and we room be ready , we be a bit dissapointed to see that half of the reception be close off and very noisey work be take place .<ssssss>-lrb- i suppose they have to do work at some point . -rrb-<ssssss>the resort itself be very nice extremely clean and well set out .<ssssss>we room be in villa 9 on the second floor and have a view of the pool and just about the sea .<ssssss>the room be very big and the bed huge .<ssssss>the bathroom be big as well and we have no problem with the water pressure infact when we be burnt one day it be a little strong .<ssssss>the only downside be that the comunial corridor be very noisy and it do not help when people be shout at 3am .<ssssss>the pool be huge we spend most of we time by the blue pool the quiet one never have a problem get a bed there or at the beach .<ssssss>the pool be a little cloudy some day .<ssssss>the bar man at the blue pool bar be the best always smill even when he be deal with some rude people .<ssssss>the food be great and would recomend the italian i think the hotel need to thing about a reservation system for the restraunt its a pain to have to wait outside in the rain for 40 min for a table .<ssssss>i would highly recommend this hotel and first choice .<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 3 5 5 -1		completely overrate - nyc , ny be very disappointed with this hotel , i basically book base on review here , which i have do in the past , but i find they off the mark this time .<ssssss>punta cana beach be beautiful easy to get to from nyc , so we will be back , but would not stay here again .<ssssss>we stay at the sol melia a few year back it be much nicer.overall , the place be show some serious wear tear .<ssssss>we get stick in the elevator one night , the landscaping be shoddy , the pool be look dingy / dirty around the edge , etc. the room be nice , although the couch in ours be disgust , i would not sit on it .<ssssss>the food be beyond terrible .<ssssss>i have eat at some bad buffet , but this be the worst i have ever see .<ssssss>the salad bar be tiny , and who want to eat hot pasta when it be 95 degree out ?<ssssss>the dominican restaurant be the best out of the lot , but not great .<ssssss>do not bother order wine -lrb- a la carte -rrb- , they must not keep it correctly because the 2 time we try it , it be terrible.the plus be that we always find a shady spot at the pool there be plenty of spot at the beach , which be really what matter to us.after walk down the beach check out other place -lrb- and stay at the sol melia in the past -rrb- , we know that there be much nicer spot in punta cana .<ssssss>do not waste you time on this one .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 3 4 2 2		pretty good but a couple of blip we book the lenox as part of a weekend package and , although it have not be we first choice , we be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>we be give a corner room which be huge but the best thing be the thickness of the wall and therefore the soundproofing - no creak floorboard or rattle plumbing from next door .<ssssss>with boston so achingly cold outside , we room be a haven of warmth and cosiness.it 's a lovely hotel and the reception and concierge staff be very friendly and helpful but a couple of detail let it down .<ssssss>after a hard day shopping we order tea from room service .<ssssss>when nothing arrive after 20 minute we chase and be tell it would be another 25 .<ssssss>how long do it take to fill a pot with boiling water ?<ssssss>when it do turn up the tea be lukewarm .<ssssss>and the bathroom -lrb- or ours , at least -rrb- be date with clanky tap and disappointing showers.still , on the up side , the location be great and they do a wicked watermelon mojito in the stylish bar !<ssssss>

3 4 3 4 5 3 3 2		nice resort we stay at the caribe club prince during april school vacation with we two boy -lrb- 11 and 15 -rrb- .<ssssss>overall the resort be very nice .<ssssss>the grounds be beautiful and we vip suite be comfortable and clean .<ssssss>the vip suite be conveniently located near the pool with the pool bar and the beach .<ssssss>we tip the maid service 3/day which give we reliable cleaning service .<ssssss>room service could be improve , we ask for a extra blanket and never receive it.the food at the buffet be good with a decent variety , however the adult in we party do experience stomach problem where the amodian ad we bring come in handy .<ssssss>make sure you bring you own medicine since in punta cana you will pay a lot more for any medicine and try to find a pharmacy be a challenge .<ssssss>we only try one of the restaurant since reservation be require and we do not like to commit to a time , we want the flexability of eat when you feel like it .<ssssss>we do try la cava and get the broil lobster which be saltier than we prefer .<ssssss>the water sport be a bit of disappointment for the kid because again you have to make a reservation even if it appear as though the equiptment be not be use .<ssssss>it be difficult to have a time schedule for kid only to find the kid be in the middle of a volley ball game once the time arrive .<ssssss>the teenager want to try parasailing but it be not free because they require you to pay for a lesson in advance , also true with wind surfing .<ssssss>the banana boat ride be not available unless you have 4 or more people .<ssssss>so overall the free watersport be a challenge to say the least and it be obvious that they be reserve water sport for the pay customer .<ssssss>there be some solicitation on the resort , sell excursion and jewlery and hand-made item which can be annoy at time .<ssssss>overall the kid still enjoy themselves .<ssssss>tip when travel with older teenager , the alcohol be a little lax so keep a eye on they .<ssssss>
2 4 2 -1 4 -1 1 -1		bad place .<ssssss>i stay in this hotel for 2 night the 26th and 27th februray with my friend.the rank it as a four star hotel but that be -------- .<ssssss>i never understand why , it do not have a minibar in the room , it have a small desk and one chair , and the internet connection be really lousy.the room be tiny.the bathroom be quite okay , it have a nice cubicale -lrb- excuse the spelling -rrb- .<ssssss>there be nothing else apart from the bad and the horrible tv with very few channels.i stay there and pay 70 euro for 2 person with breakfast , so for the price , i could not complain , otherwise it be not worth pay more.they have no tissus in the bathroom , no body lotion , really nothing you have to bring everything yourself , and as for the breakfast , it be really choiceless.i love the area since it be close to the beach , and with a shopping centre in the area.the subway be 10 minute walk from the hotel and take you to the centre in 15 minutes.i do not recommend this hotel , and next time i will stay in rafael hotele , a hotel close by , which be a much better choice .<ssssss>
1 1 3 1 3 1 3 -1		you may encounter issue with this hotel when my so and i see the tempting offer of a one free night for this hotel , i automatically check the review on tripadvisor in order to make we mind up .<ssssss>and the majority of the positive review convinced we .<ssssss>we notice think that almost 3 year ago , there be some people not happy with they stay ... so hear now what we have to say about we stay here.first of all , this so call 4 star hotel be badly located .<ssssss>it be in the north of the city , right to the circular highway surround the city .<ssssss>what do this mean ?<ssssss>yes , it be quite noisy , so if you still want to go , be sure to ask for the room to be furthest possible from the highway -lrb- on the right side as you face the hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>but do not bet you money that they will provide you with the room you ask for -lrb- we ask for a double room , get a twin one instead -lrb- it have happen , by the way , in all the hotel we have stay before -rrb- ; however , the rest of the hotel give we a double room when we have politely point out that this be we initial request ; alimara be the only hotel that refuse that request , claim that no other double room be available -rrb- .<ssssss>it be true however that the hotel be quite close -lrb- less then 5 min wale -rrb- from the mundet subway station on the 3rd line -rrb- which allow you to get quickly downtown .<ssssss>i recommend use the subway : even if tempt to walk , you will soon find out that you plan do not indicate that in order to get to the city center you will have to cross the hill where the guell park be located , and the street be quite steep.getting back to the hotel , the reception be quite glacial when i refuse to provide they with the credit card detail .<ssssss>they claim that this way they be try to insure we be go to pay the extra -lrb- like minibar and pay tv -rrb- .<ssssss>i insist that we do not intend to consume anything from the minibar or to wath pay per view .<ssssss>to this , they claim that this be the standard procedure across spain -lrb- fact deny by local spanish relative i ask -rrb- .<ssssss>finally , they give up this request.as i have already say , breakfast be not include , but i will not recommend to pay 11 â‚ ?<ssssss>/ person / breakfast .<ssssss>instead , wake up at 9 , go out from the hotel , go left , cross the street , then take the stair down , go underneath the building and you be in a space with residence around .<ssssss>there underneath you will see the entrance to a consum supermarket , where you will find what you will need for quite a fine and cheap breakfast -lrb- and lunch and dinner , also -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be spacious though , but then you will have the same thing i have see in quite all the hotel i have be to : you need you unlocking card to be plug in in order to have electrical power -lrb- however the air condition and the minibar seem to have they own circuit -lrb- we find the air conditioning run after room cleaning lady pass and the thing we leave in the minibar be cold -rrb- .<ssssss>about the pay tv , there seem be a bug in they system , and if you play a little with the remote you may be able to access directly the channel where the movie play -lrb- normally not directly accessible -rrb- without have to pass through the outrageous expensive pay per view channel -lrb- 10.70 â‚ ?<ssssss>/ movie -rrb- .<ssssss>-lrb- they claim that in order to have pay tv disabled in you room , all you have to do be to ask the receptionist ; i do , but of course , he do nothing , even if he claim the contrary -rrb- .<ssssss>when check out , we once again have a hard time explain we do not want to be in they computerized guest database , that we do not want to receive any offer from they part .<ssssss>one of the receptionist say well , if you want to be remove , just call we , to which i say what be the point into call you later , i be tell you to remove my information now !<ssssss>the lady do not seem to get it , so he ask another male coworker -lrb- who by the way have trouble to explain to a german couple that be checkout too , and be about to discover that they advertised price be without vat -rrb- and he assure I that any information about I be go to be remove -lrb- and sure , he be go to do that , just like he other colleague disable the pay tv -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all , we have quite a unpleasant experience , and we do not recommend this hotel , who definitely do not deserve its 4 star .<ssssss>

2 2 1 4 4 3 1 3		overrate and overprice !<ssssss>the serrano be overrate and overprice .<ssssss>the exterior and interior of the building be old , dingy and overall unimpressive .<ssssss>when i first see the hotel , i be actually a bit shocked at its nondescript , old look exterior .<ssssss>in addition , the room be nothing special and the bathroom have problems.on the phone when i be confirm my online reservation , i specifically request a room on the highest level possible with the best view possible and i receive the exact opposite -- a room on the 5th floor with the worst view possible of the fire escape and ugly building wall .<ssssss>hotel staff claim they never receive my telephonic request .<ssssss>what poor service !<ssssss>to compensate , staff subsequently offer to give I a suite for the price of a regular room on my next visit .<ssssss>however , i do not care to stay at the serrano again .<ssssss>so , that compensation be meaningless.the bathroom be very small and a lot of water leak from the shower whenever we use it .<ssssss>the bathroom be very old and remind I of the bathroom in my grandmother 's 100 + year-old house in l.a. the location be central and good for walk to union square .<ssssss>but , so what !<ssssss>better hotel can be have in that general area for the same or lower price .<ssssss>for example , i stay at grosvenor suite on nob hill for a lower price than at the serrano and be much , much happier with the spacious room , extremely generous closet space and great customer service .<ssssss>

2 3 3 5 2 4 3 -1		disappointing my husband and i recently go to nyc for we honeymoon .<ssssss>we have originally plan to stay at a large hotel chain , like the hilton , but decide that a small , romantic boutique hotel would be much nicer .<ssssss>after read review and see that it be rate most romantic hotel in nyc in a travel guide , we decide on the hotel elysee .<ssssss>we book directly through the hotel , tell they it be we honeymoon , and stay for 11 day .<ssssss>we be both less than impressed.the concierge i deal with over the phone -lrb- we use he for help in make restaurant reservation -rrb- be usually very polite , but seem very new at he job .<ssssss>i have to call and remind he to do thing several time .<ssssss>i be not be a nag , but when i call to check on thing -lrb- we stay over the new year 's eve holiday , so i want to make sure that restaurant be not book up . -rrb-<ssssss>, he often have forget to call certain restaurant when he say he would .<ssssss>i also have to call and confirm every reservation on my own .<ssssss>in past experience , the concierge usually do this for you .<ssssss>i also ask he several time for restaurant recommendation , and never get any .<ssssss>he pull out he zagat guide over the phone and flip through it .<ssssss>i be sorry , but i have a zagat guide , too , and i do not need someone to read it to I over the phone .<ssssss>i feel that if you be a concierge , it be part of you job to know about restaurant in the area and be able to make recommendation upon request.the room itself be very average .<ssssss>we have a king suite , and be tell twice over the phone that we would have a kitchenette with a full-size fridge .<ssssss>when we arrive , there be a mini fridge in the living room and that be it .<ssssss>we get in so late and be so tired that we do not complain and just keep the room , but in retrospect , especially consider it be we honeymoon , we should have request a different room .<ssssss>the flat screen tv in the living room be nice , but the couch be so uncomfortable -lrb- just a old fold-out -rrb- that we never sit in there to watch .<ssssss>we view be ridiculous-a lovely air shaft overlook another building .<ssssss>there be better view in that hotel .<ssssss>the bathroom be small but fine , we understand that room be much smaller in nyc .<ssssss>however , we do expect it to be clean .<ssssss>one morning , every new towel that have be leave by housekeeping the night before have hair on it .<ssssss>not a great thing to wake up to.the service be fine , and everyone be helpful in get we bag to and from we room , but no one be very friendly .<ssssss>we realize that the attitude be different in nyc , but when you be stay in a small hotel like that , you expect more , especially when you be pay so much .<ssssss>it make we feel a bit unwelcome , and as if they be do we a huge favor just by be there.all in all it be a nice hotel , but not great , unless maybe you have the piano suite .<ssssss>i would try somewhere else next time .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 5 5 2 4		can do better i have just come from toronto where i stay in a excellent 3-star hotel , and be expect this 4-star hotel to be even better.there be a great fancy lobby , and very friendly staff , but the room be terribly disappointing .<ssssss>the bathroom be nice and be clean .<ssssss>but the furntiture and the television be seriously outdated.also , everything have a price-tag on it , which i find really unpleasant .<ssssss>there be no tea/coffee facility in the room , and the room service be expensive and of poor quality .<ssssss>i be starve when i arrive so order a pizza , which arrive cold .<ssssss>i request a breakfast the first morning and they get my order wrong.the hotel location be good however - be right next to union square .<ssssss>and the staff be helpful in get I a flat-rate taxi to the airport.i would not stay here again , and wouldnt advise my friend to either .<ssssss>

3 4 2 4 3 4 1 -1		the good and the bad i stay at this hotel the day before and the day after a cruise i take out of san juan .<ssssss>during the first stay , they upgrade I to a suite right next to the pool that be a room of the quality you would see on mtv crib !<ssssss>this be amazing !<ssssss>i suspect they do this because it be my first stay at a intercontinental resort and holiday inn want I to keep come back .<ssssss>however , on the second stay , i be in a typical room ... which be nothing special.the hotel have one of the nicest pool with beach entry that you will find on the beachy section of puerto rico .<ssssss>there be a nice bar area in the middle where you can sit and have one of the weakest $ 9 drink you will ever get .<ssssss>however there be plenty of lounge chair to lay out on and a nice -lrb- but crowd pool . -rrb-<ssssss>the hotel room -lrb- i be review the standard room here ... if you have the money to get a pool side suite , you will thank yourself as the suite be one of the nicest hotel room i have stay in anywhere -rrb- ... have yellowish stucco wall and medditeranian style furniture .<ssssss>it do not really make I feel comfortable be in there for some reason .<ssssss>there be a balcony that overlook the street -lrb- they be book up and could not move I to one that overlook the ocean in the back -rrb- .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable but the room just lack style .<ssssss>it feel like one of those cheap florida condo .<ssssss>the bathroom be small and cheap looking.the location be good if you want to be on the beach .<ssssss>it be not very glamorous .<ssssss>it remind I a little of atlantic city .<ssssss>the casino inside the hotel be small and there be a few good -lrb- but very overpriced restaurant -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a palm steakhouse and a japanese hibachi style restaurant .<ssssss>the area around the hotel be pretty run down ... if you want to go to old san juan where the cruise ship dock , it will cost you about $ 15 for a cab there .<ssssss>it be several mile away .<ssssss>the weird thing be that the airport be only 1 or 2 mile away from the hotel yet because puerto rico charge cabfare by the zone , you will still pay $ 15 to get there.the hotel overall be keep up pretty nicely .<ssssss>if you can talk yourself into the club lounge -lrb- priority club -rrb- they have great hors d'erve and a open bar !<ssssss>the lobby area and casino area of the hotel be fairly classy and it do feel a little upscale .<ssssss>however , i would not be comfortable pay more than $ 150 - $ 175 a night for the hotel base on what you get .<ssssss>if you be look for nightlife and the real old side of san juan instead of the beach/pool scene ... this be not the place for you .<ssssss>stay in the heart of the old city if this be what you want as this be more of a beach resort .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 2 3 2 3		still beautiful , traditional and unique but in need of repair just finish a late dec. stay at the el convento and it be still beautiful -lrb- stay there before -rrb- .<ssssss>interior courtyard be truly gorgeous and such a restful place to sit and have coffee .<ssssss>however , the room and hotel common area be certainly in need of repair .<ssssss>the hotel hot tub have a thick layer of mold around the top and be completly crack and break .<ssssss>the wall above the pool be also crack and in need of paint .<ssssss>while we room have a lovely balcony and be the standard unique el convento style -- we sheet have hole in they and the tub be stain and crack and in need of repair.in addition , the staff be very friendly but quite inadept with direction and recommendation .<ssssss>three time we get wrong directions/addresses -lrb- for location as close as three block away -rrb- , reservation be make but we be never inform -lrb- they forget -rrb- and information on major attraction such as the bio bay and the bacardus distillery be faulty if they have any information at all.that say , the location be the best in town , much rather stay in old san juan for the food and entertainment and walk proximity to the fort and pier etc. there be a great flamenco restaurant across the little square outside the hotel and la bombombera can not be beat for any meal especially breakfast.we pay less than $ 200 to stay and that make it worth be but as the price of el convento creep up they must really make more of a effort to ensure the little thing be keep up as well -lrb- hole in sheet be just unacceptable -rrb-<ssssss>
3 3 4 3 2 5 4 1		nice hotel we have a beautiful room , very big , with a comfortable bed and a huge bathroom , but this be a old hotel , date .<ssssss>i find it not very clean , the carpet be dirty and also the restaurant be like that -lrb- and food be not so good ... -rrb- .<ssssss>i do not like all that cement , gray wall .<ssssss>anyway , people work there be nice , we arrive late at night but they allow we to have dinner even if the restaurant be already close , and they give we a lot of information : very nice and polite.i think it be a good hotel if you have child -lrb- the pool be very big -rrb- , but it be too much expensive for the quality of the building .<ssssss>

4 4 4 3 4 4 4 1		nice and modern , but not the best i stay here because it be close to a friend 's place in aberdeen and the price be right .<ssssss>i have some concern about its location on the other side of the island , but the hotel shuttle be only hkd 29 and can take you to central in about 15 minute .<ssssss>taxi be not that expensive and there be a bus terminal conveniently located nearby as well.the room be nice and modern .<ssssss>what bother I the most , however , be that i get the feeling this place be really try to nickel and dime they guest to death -lrb- and that they be not do so well financially -rrb- .<ssssss>the room desk have this tacky stand of thing to buy , such as flip flop , t-shirt , etc. the web site say the room have herme soap , but actually they give you a small sliver of house soap , but you can purchase a bigger bar of herme soap .<ssssss>the internet be not free , which be silly consider that cyberport be suppose to be hong kong 's high-tech hub .<ssssss>as another poster mention , there be no robe and the pool do get crowd and noisy .<ssssss>adult who want some peace and quiet will be disappoint at the pool -lrb- noisy kid everywhere -rrb- , as well as everyone in the coffee shop be able to stare at them.the price , however , be over usd 100 less for other hotel on hong kong , and there be a post office , supermarket and a hard-to-find starbuck located nearby .<ssssss>forget the dead mall next door.i only eat the breakfast buffet , and think it be very well do .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 3 2 -1		fantastic hotel and location be fantastic walk distance to major attraction and really tidy and contemporary .<ssssss>pool on the roof be excellent however the water be a little cold .<ssssss>the staff however where my only gripe they be not particularly helpful when ask for assistance they do not particularly care .<ssssss>this however would not stop I from return excellent hotel in a excellent city !<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 4 -1 2 -1		surround sound air conditioners-yikes !!!<ssssss>when my husband and i go to bed in we room at this hotel , we be jar awake by surround sound humming and vibration .<ssssss>we call the front desk , who send someone up , and they say it be all of the air conditioner on the roof .<ssssss>they tell we they would move we .<ssssss>it be 11:30 pm .<ssssss>at 12:15 be a woman come to move we to another room .<ssssss>my husband have to lift all of we bag and put they in she vehicle .<ssssss>because this place be so large , we have to not only move we stuff , but try and find a parking spot for we car .<ssssss>after settle into we new room , we discover that they have put we in a room with no work air conditioner .<ssssss>we do not sleep well needless to say .<ssssss>my request to speak with a manager the next morning go unfulfilled .<ssssss>when we get home , there be unexplained charge on we credit card .<ssssss>my second request to speak with a manager have be unfulfilled .<ssssss>i have send a letter to corporate and that have be leave unanswered .<ssssss>and do i mention that the remote and the toilet in we first room do not work either .<ssssss>save yourself the pain and grief !!!!!!<ssssss>there be plenty of other resort out there .<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 4 1 4 -1		great location great location - but anyone consider stay should find out if they be still do lobby reconstruction - the make shift lobby be crowd , overheate and in chaos-espeically around checkin and out time - when enter or leave the hotel you be always dodge tired guest and they pile of luggage .<ssssss>my room , face a court yard where the construction worker saw and hammer start at 9am !<ssssss>good thing i be a early bird as sleeping in would have be impossible .<ssssss>in addition there be a parklot resurfacing project go on next door - which include a loud sander that go from 10-5 each day sort of put a damper on the thought of any mid afternoon siesta .<ssssss>my inquiry about the noise at the front desk be meet with shrug - which i think be the most disappointing thing - since i be out of the room for the most part , i didn ; t make a stink and request another room - but they do not offer any solution as well - disappointing for a suppose 5 star hotelon the positive be the location , and the room themselves be clean , roomy and up to date - also the bar at the top of the hotel have a great view and be a perfect place to end the day with a drink .<ssssss>because of the location and the nice room , i would consider stay there once construction be complete - but just think i would give a heads-up to fellow traveler ...<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 4 5 3 4		small room but nice design taxi no problem to find the hotel .<ssssss>modern stylish design , clean , have a boutique hotel feel , helpful staff , good location close to ave. diagonal and blue line of the bus turÃ­stic .<ssssss>breakfast buffet adequate , nothing special .<ssssss>very convenient and free wireless internet .<ssssss>on the bad side , we room be tiny .<ssssss>the bathroom , which be very nice , be 1/3 of the whole room .<ssssss>it be crowd .<ssssss>aircon do not work properly and we be without water for a few hour one day .<ssssss>not enough pillow ... only one long pillow for two people and one half pillow .<ssssss>light in the bathroom a bit strange ... it only work on a timer , and a short one on that , so find ourselves race through shower to avoid be leave in the dark .<ssssss>we also try to order room service at 10:45 and could not , when room service officially go until 11 pm.but those failing do not serve to create any major grief and it be a decent stay over all .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 3 2 1 -1		warn the experience we have at this resort be worse than i could have ever imagine .<ssssss>the day we arrive there be no offer to assist we to get we luggage to we room so we carry it ourselves .<ssssss>we would have gladly tip well for some assistance with get we luggage to the second floor of villa four .<ssssss>once in the room we notice a few problem .<ssssss>for example , the bathtub do not have a drain plug so the jacuzzi tub be not a option .<ssssss>we call the front desk for 1 extra pillow and a drain plug but it never arrive .<ssssss>the first night there be very loud .<ssssss>a fight break out in the middle of the night with someone on the third floor try to kick in a door .<ssssss>there be a lot of yell in spanish so we do not know what the fight be about .<ssssss>the next day we go directly to the office to ask to be move to a different room .<ssssss>there seem to be no manager available no matter what time of day you try to speak with one .<ssssss>we eventually do get a different room in villa four but it be on the third floor and it be more quiet , however there be no water to the shower .<ssssss>i be not say the pressure be bad , i be say there be no water at all .<ssssss>of course when we call the office they take a message but it be not fix .<ssssss>the other complaint be the food , it be terrible .<ssssss>all of the restaurant serve the same food and it be really bad .<ssssss>we try to eat at the mexican restaurant and we leave without finish .<ssssss>my husband order taco and we could not tell if it be beef or chicken because it be burn so badly .<ssssss>we finally have enough after two day we hire a taxi to take we to a different resort -lrb- dream -rrb- and it be very expensive because it be last minute .<ssssss>we do not care about the cost at that point because we be so stressed out that we just want to leave ocean blue .<ssssss>the beach be very pretty and the grounds be keep well .<ssssss>we advice : find a different resort if you care at all about quality of service and food .<ssssss>
2 1 1 2 1 4 2 3		would not return i stay at hotel union square for one night in jan , 08 .<ssssss>my room be on the 2nd floor and overlook the street .<ssssss>we stay there because we think we could walk to we conference site and the hotel do have a outdoor parking lot right behind the hotel .<ssssss>however , the room be very small and do not appear like the web page photo , not even close .<ssssss>although the room be fairly clean , there be no clock and there be no phone map to show which button take you where .<ssssss>my friend 's room down the hall have no window at all and she phone do not work at all so she have to change room .<ssssss>we both decide we would not stay there again for the price and the unrealistic advertising .<ssssss>the front desk staff be nice but the hotel be dingy and have a lot of thing wrong with it , thing break , chip tile , cigarette butt throw outside the window and lie on the roof etc. etc. do not make I feel relax or rest .<ssssss>just want to leave asap .<ssssss>
2 4 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		decent value for a decent -lrb- at best -rrb- hotel while the price here for stay in the union square area be something of a draw , after stay here you will have a sense that you get what you pay for.we be give a room that have that old hotel scent - my wife liken the smell to a grandmother 's basement - a mildew-y , old clothes smell .<ssssss>now , it be quite possible that not every room have this smell , but for we , it be a certain reminder that we be in a old hotel.in addition , there be no air conditioner -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>in we top floor room , and that be a challenge when you need to open window over busy and noisy geary st. the bed also be not real comfortable with a mushy mattress and old and worn sheet .<ssssss>otherwise , the room be very clean and perfectly servicable.note that give the age of the hotel , there be no high speed internet connection in the room available .<ssssss>however , there be free wireless available in the lobby and mezzanine - which , by the way , be charming and generally invite , if worn.the hotel have a nice location in that it be on the main street -lrb- geary -rrb- in the union square area , just a few block from the square itself .<ssssss>service be friendly and helpful too.all in all , you might not have the room experience we have , and for the price , this be a decent value in the union square area .<ssssss>there be nothing here that should scare you away if you be on a real budget .<ssssss>but you can generally do better with similar price at some of the other hotel in the area -lrb- check out the kimpton or the joie de vivre chain , which have a few hotel in the union square area . -rrb-<ssssss>

ideal couple , circus show , mr majestic and the magic show .<ssssss>all show be entertaining in a cheesy kind of way .<ssssss>i enjoy it more than my husband do .<ssssss>oh , and also , we get ton of bug bite while watch the show .<ssssss>make sure you take bug spray if you go.service : we encounter some really good service and some really poor service .<ssssss>some bartender be really nice and some just do not seem to care .<ssssss>we still tip $ 1 for every drink .<ssssss>take plenty of $ 1 bill for tip .<ssssss>we tip normally $ 1 per drink and $ 2 - $ 5 per meal .<ssssss>most people do not tip but we could not help it , they do work hard.casino : i normally play blackjack but there be only 3 blackjack table .<ssssss>do not expect too much from the casino , it be very small with limited seat if you go late at night .<ssssss>we always stop by after the nightly show and it get pretty crowd .<ssssss>also , i be not sure if the dealer do this on purpose or not , but they mess up a lot .<ssssss>you have to watch they carefully , as i catch they several time mess up on we pay.we do not do any excursion because of the bad weather .<ssssss>it basically rain most of the day we be there , except for the first and last day .<ssssss>boo : - -lrb- check-out : we get into a heated argument with the hotel management and because of this incident , i will never go back to majestic again .<ssssss>during we check-in , jenny -lrb- who normally work at guest service -rrb- tell we room-service be include with we all-inclusive package .<ssssss>as she be put the supreme gray bracelet on we , she tell we that that be the highest level bracelet and that all room service be include .<ssssss>because of this my husband and i decide to take advantage and order room service during the rainy afternoon .<ssssss>when we be checking-out , we be tell that the room service be not include with the gray bracelet and we owe over $ 100 we dollar .<ssssss>i speak to 2 different supervisor there -lrb- francisco and victor -rrb- who both tell we that we should have double check and tell we we have to pay up .<ssssss>i tell they jenny tell we room service be include , and they be response be there be no jenny that work here .<ssssss>there be 1 jenny at guest service .<ssssss>we try tell they that be the correct jenny that help we check-in , but they do not do anything about it .<ssssss>they look at we like we be liar .<ssssss>they do not seem to care and do not even try to handle the situation correctly by get jenny to come over and talk to we .<ssssss>so , i have to walk all the way to guest service myself and bring jenny back .<ssssss>they basically tell we that jenny do not know the correct rule and tell we false information , but that it be we responsibily to double check .<ssssss>we be furious , and about 30 min of argue with they we notice line start to form behind we -lrb- usual check-out time -rrb- .<ssssss>they finally decide to credit we the money but they be not happy with it .<ssssss>i feel like the only reason they decide to credit we the amount be because they do not want we to make a scene in front of other guest .<ssssss>we stay at the majestic colonial be just ok but we leave with a lot of anger .<ssssss>i be furious at how they treat we while we be checking-out .<ssssss>it be funny how one incident can totally change you mind about the place .<ssssss>

3 3 4 5 3 5 3 -1		three and a half to four star i book this hotel online through the hotel website .<ssssss>staff be really efficient and helpful at this point , as they be at check-in on arrival .<ssssss>as other review have note , the location be great.the room be nice with very comfortable bed and a contemporary , well equip bathroom .<ssssss>we stay here be enjoyable but a couple of thing mar it for we .<ssssss>one be the lack of hotel foyer and no internet access -lrb- yes , like the other reviewer we be tell to go down the road and the internet cafe be a bit of a hike -rrb- .<ssssss>the entrance reception be cramped , although it do open out into a nice courtyard , it be not particularly invite place to sit in .<ssssss>during this visit to paris we also stay in another hotel in the 7th and it have a lovely foyer with internet access , comfy couch and european newspaper - and a little bar .<ssssss>so this be the comparison .<ssssss>a foyer can be a nice place to hang out!the other irritation be that the air-conditioning in we room do not work , and it take a lot of persistence to get the problem fix .<ssssss>we be eventually move to another room , after repeat request , and not until 1am when we be swelter and the street noise below make open window impossibe for sleeping.i think the slow response be due to the inexperience of the night staff , who keep say he have to call the manager to ok the room swap when it become clear the air conditioning could not be easily fix .<ssssss>prior to this , we have be ask twice to leave the air-conditioning on for 20 minute to ascertain whether or not it be break !<ssssss>the night staff be very apologetic when we eventually moved.and finally , on checkout when i request a taxi , i be tell it be not worth call one , that it would be quicker to haul my luggage around the corner to rue rivolus and flag one down .<ssssss>i find this unsatisfactory for a 4 star hotel and wonder whether or not the hotel have try hard enough to broker arrangement with taxi company ?<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 4 4 4 2		good stay here from august 7-9 .<ssssss>the hotel lobby and staff be among some the best i encounter in china .<ssssss>room be pleasant and well decorate , and the lobby be very nice .<ssssss>it feel like a nice business hotel in the we or europe , and give the location its a great place to stay while in beijing.the location be perfect for visit tian ` anman square and the forbid city , as well as shopping at the night market and on wangfujing .<ssssss>taxi be extremely unexpensive but make sure you get a small card from the hotel with the hotel 's name in chinese character for the ride back .<ssssss>there be several bar and restaurant in the hotel , but i didnt try any of them.i arrange for a car service to the great wall , and the concierge be very helpful in speak to the company for I and arrange all the detail .<ssssss>on the other hand , one night go to the concierge to ask for a recommendation to get peking duck ... the recommendation werent great.on the downside , the business centre be way too expensive , and the travel agency wasnt as helpful as we would have hope .<ssssss>the massage salon next door as well seem to be overly aggressive ... couldnt walk by without be hound for a massage.overall though for the price and value you will have a hard tme find a better hotel in beijing .<ssssss>especially if you be come to visit and not on business , this seem like the perfect place to stay .<ssssss>

and a large fee at that .<ssssss>this one be free .<ssssss>other marriott could learn from this and put they greed aside.check in be suppose to be at 15:00 and be disappointing - in fact the worst part of the stay .<ssssss>after a long trip from belgium , the last thing we want be a unpleasant surprise to deal with .<ssssss>we arrive around 13:30 , announce ourselves , leave we bag and go for lunch at the metropol .<ssssss>so they know we be wait .<ssssss>no complaint yet as we be early .<ssssss>return at 15:00 to be tell that the room wasnâ€™t ready and that check in begin at 15:00 .<ssssss>not at 15:00 , but begin at 15:00 .<ssssss>what do that mean ?<ssssss>check in could be as late as midnight ???<ssssss>i become difficult at that point and give the desk many question that they either stumble through or couldnâ€˜t answer without a canned reply from the marriott book .<ssssss>in the end the room be ready at 16:00 .<ssssss>it would have be later have i not be such a nuisance .<ssssss>the desk be professional , mature and polite , but gear to justify the situation .<ssssss>-lrb- do you know that it take 45 minute to clean a room and that there be four cleaner for every twelve room , some people donâ€™t check out on time and that a lot of other people be also wait ? -rrb-<ssssss>interesting but not as interesting as â€œCheck-in begin at 15:00 !!!<ssssss>.<ssssss>we be tell to go awayâ€?and have lunch , or have dinner , or have a drink , or walk around .<ssssss>also , the desk staff keep disappear into the rear for we and other people try to check in which really slow thing .<ssssss>when i tell they that we have hope to have a few hour at the beach for the child , we be tell that most family bring a change of beach clothes with they in case this situation happen .<ssssss>that be really helpful .<ssssss>nothing be offer to make we feel better -lrb- free drink , food coupon , room discount , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>we be inform that the room be a upgrade from â€œOcean viewâ€?to â€œOcean frontâ€ ?<ssssss>but the room wasnâ€™t on the front , so i donâ€™t know what they be talk about .<ssssss>maybe there be room with ocean front in capital letter and ocean front in lower case .<ssssss>but they lose big , big point here .<ssssss>after all , this be a marriott and marriott have a lot of beating of drum over be a great host .<ssssss>-lrb- the late check-in appear to be a daily occurrence . -rrb-<ssssss>room be good size and nice , but average .<ssssss>bathroom be clean but â€œtiredâ€ ?<ssssss>large screen tv with good channel .<ssssss>small fridge .<ssssss>small safe in room .<ssssss>bed be very , very comfortable .<ssssss>could have use a bit more storage furniture.pool have a lagoon motif .<ssssss>not very big , but always space available .<ssssss>-lrb- the beach be so nice that most people go there . -rrb-<ssssss>lot of sun bed pool-side or by the beach .<ssssss>hot tub be hot , really too hot - but then again , it be call a hot tub .<ssssss>pool staff very polite and efficient .<ssssss>there be a wedding one afternoon and it be interesting to see how they slowly close down part of the patio to accommodate the wedding with minimal impact on the other guests.we have stay at the intercontinental -lrb- ic , for the purpose of this review -rrb- the last time we be in isle verde - and the ic be superior to the courtyard in every category .<ssssss>but then , the ic cost more .<ssssss>we expectation of the courtyard be high base on the ic , so some aspect be disappointing from the start.the best part of the hotel be the access to the beach - one of the reason we stay here .<ssssss>clean sand , nice wave , leave the pool and walk right onto the beach itself .<ssssss>kid love it .<ssssss>safe and fun .<ssssss>house-keeping be a bit slow , but they lose big point as we find a use condom on the bathroom floor when we first enter the room during we late check-in .<ssssss>yuck !!!!<ssssss>housekeeping resource be also just as strained during the visit as it be during the check-in .<ssssss>the first full day the room wasnâ€™t clean until 17:00 .<ssssss>i speak with my friend at the check-in desk and they fix this .<ssssss>afterwards , the room be clean in the morning .<ssssss>i guess that you have to tell the hotel what you want instead of let they guess what you want.the hotel have several restaurant , but better value for money could be find outside .<ssssss>there be a breakfast buffet for $ 15.95 , but as a family of four , it would cost about $ 70 once the tax be apply .<ssssss>there be a ice cream counter that also have some baked item , but despite have three people behind the counter , you have to beat they with a stick to get they attention .<ssssss>in fairness to the hotel regard food price , all the other hotel on the beach also price gouge .<ssssss>they will charge as much as they think they can get you to pay .<ssssss>there be people in the restaurant , but many of they be short term visitor who go in without know what the damage would be .<ssssss>the price at the ic be much worse.as a breakfast alternative , there be a dennyâ€™s ten minute away across from the metropol -lrb- see below -rrb- .<ssssss>normal dennnyâ€™s food , but service be very , very slow .<ssssss>accept it and you will be happy .<ssssss>expect something snappy and you will get into a irritated funk .<ssssss>with the portion they serve , we brood of four only cost $ 20 .<ssssss>also a walgreen pharmacy in the same shopping area.speaking of price , we take it on the chin for the room charge .<ssssss>during christmas they -lrb- and all the other hotel -rrb- double the rate .<ssssss>so instead of around $ 180 a day , the room be $ 350 .<ssssss>it be still cheaper than the other hotel we consider .<ssssss>they also attach a â€œresort feeâ€?of $ 45 -lrb- 13 % of the base price -rrb- a night .<ssssss>i be tell that cover free water in the room , towel service at the pool and entertainment at night .<ssssss>seem like a lot for daily water , one towel per person and loud music .<ssssss>it wasnâ€™t a government require fee -lrb- like tourist tax -rrb- , but just a marriott policy .<ssssss>why charge a separate fee for no visible and severable cost unless you be try to hide a surcharge to make you rate look more attractive ?<ssssss>also a fee of $ 25 for each person in the room over two people per night .<ssssss>so in we case , another $ 50 per night .<ssssss>not a severable cost that they be try to recover .<ssssss>it be just a additional price that marriott charge .<ssssss>as they couldnâ€™t associate a cost for the two extra people other than extra towel , i suppose the hotel grab what it can take .<ssssss>we know about the fee when we make the reservation by look closely at the marriott website , but many of my fellow traveler be surprise to see it on they bill .<ssssss>why hide these cost in the small print of the reservation ?<ssssss>put it up front in the rate .<ssssss>greed .<ssssss>and greed will find you by yourself and lonely one day marriott at isle verde.the hotel over charge we on the final bill in that one of we brood be 12 and exempt to the $ 25 extra person fee and they apply the 13 % resort fee to the extra person fee also .<ssssss>we chat about it for some time and they finally eliminate the resort fee , but keep the extra person fees.as we be now on food , the location of hotel be a little inconvenient as it be on the end of the develop beach .<ssssss>all the non-hotel restaurant be a short walk away along a busy road -lrb- busy with car , but sometimes a little uneasily devoid of people - especially at night - until you reach the metropol -rrb- .<ssssss>lot of â€œfamilyâ€?style or fast food place 15 minute away on the main rood -lrb- across from the ic -rrb- .<ssssss>as well as the mi casita in a small strip mall across from the ic - good local fare at very reasonable price .<ssssss>basic atmosphere , but always pack .<ssssss>the bill at mi casita double charge the drink one night , so buyer beware .<ssssss>also a chinese place a few door down from mi casita .<ssssss>normally not very full , but tasty .<ssssss>not great , but tasty.best non-hotel restaurant remain the metropol - local food , fairly price , big portion , nice atmosphere .<ssssss>between the hotel and the ic and next to the cock-fighting arena -lrb- wonder if the lose bird be serve at the restaurant next door ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>we go there almost everyday .<ssssss>the kid love the grilled red snapper .<ssssss>i like the pepper steak cuban style and stuff guinea fowl .<ssssss>service could have be better , but it depend if you have the a team or the b team for waiter .<ssssss>also , the wife report that there wasnâ€™t any run water in the lady room for three day -lrb- include flush -rrb- .<ssssss>so â€œfreshen upâ€?before you go just in case and avoid a seat -lrb- at a table -rrb- near the toilet .<ssssss>she report it each time , but what the heck - all the waiter be guy so i suppose it didnâ€™t matter .<ssssss>menâ€™s room be fine .<ssssss>sound like a one-off since this hadnâ€™t occur on previous vacation there.the worst mexican food in north america can still be find at lupiâ€™s on the main drag between the hotel and the ic .<ssssss>great place for get beer up and watch sport programme , but the food be the worst mexican fare i have ever have .<ssssss>iâ€™ve see some good review of it on the internet , but i wonder how much these reviewer have to drink before they eat something there .<ssssss>last year two of the dish werenâ€™t edible - when we bring it to they attention , the waitress and â€œmanagerâ€?assured we that the food be fine , and we have just order something that we didnâ€™t like -lrb- grilled snapper or grouper and a traditional mexican combo plate -rrb- .<ssssss>such a disappointment .<ssssss>it look like the menu have change somewhat since last time , but after we first experience , why throw money away .<ssssss>anything that bad doesnâ€™t deserve a second chance .<ssssss>have say that , we do dip we toe in the water and try the lupiâ€™s nacho during a beering session .<ssssss>i think they be so-so , but the wife think they be the worst sheâ€™s have .<ssssss>guacamole be describe as slimey and the beef suspicious .<ssssss>she couldnâ€™t eat it .<ssssss>that be yesterday and i donâ€™t feel sick , so i suppose it be ok to eat it .<ssssss>the pool guy at the hotel also think that the food be bad - with the exception of the buffalo wing .<ssssss>look fantastic from the outside as a mexican sport bar - you mouth will water , but such a disappointment .<ssssss>itâ€™s hard to mess up mexican food -lrb- even taco bell express and old el paso at the supermarket get by -rrb- , but they find the secret -lrb- its even worse than mine -rrb- .<ssssss>one thing we didnâ€™t like -lrb- not relate to the hotel -rrb- , be the absence of small grocery store .<ssssss>7-11â€˜s , etc. to stock the fridge in the room there be one across from the ic of good size , but the shelf be only one third full .<ssssss>strange place .<ssssss>there be also a pueblo market on the other side of the holiday inn , but not very easy to get to.would i go back again ?<ssssss>if my first choice be too expensive or full , i think that i would .<ssssss>but i would watch the bill like a hawk and let they know ahead of time that check-in be at 15:00 and room be to be clean in the morning .<ssssss>after all , the beach be great and the people try hard to make it a nice stay -lrb- once you check in -rrb- .<ssssss>

2 2 1 5 2 3 3 3		the biggest dump with the best view this be the dumpiest room i have ever stay in .<ssssss>the room be tiny and the quirky oriental furniture very worn .<ssssss>but nothing could out do the horrible dirty worn carpet .<ssssss>it be suppose to be pink but it be grey in path area .<ssssss>the bathroom have be redone and be great .<ssssss>other than the worn icky condition , the linen , etc be clean .<ssssss>the hotel be be refirbish , which be not a problem ... but they really should not rent out those room until they take up that carpet .<ssssss>we be too embarrase to have we other family member up to we room .<ssssss>now the view be spectacular .<ssssss>full front on view of wakiki beach ... amazing .<ssssss>and the location be fabulous .<ssssss>i would not stay at this hotel until all the work have be do ... especially the carpet .<ssssss>the room do not look anything like the online picture .<ssssss>the staff be nice .<ssssss>i really feel sorry for those people who have book a room with a view of the wall .<ssssss>

2 1 2 4 2 2 3 3		money can be spend much better elsewhere good : the soniat house be a nice example of historic new orlean architecture .<ssssss>the doorman and waiter be extremely friendly .<ssssss>the hotel be conveniently located in the french quarter.bad : the room be a bit dingy .<ssssss>they could use a interior decorator and a paint job .<ssssss>the ac unit in we room be very loud during we stay -lrb- but essential in the new orlean heat -rrb- .<ssssss>the breakfast -lrb- two biscuit , coffee , and oj -rrb- be a joke at almost $ 13 per person , and at these rate , it should absolutely be include in the price of the room .<ssssss>the $ 15 surcharge for a bucket of ice be even more ridiculous .<ssssss>i walk around the corner and buy bag of ice from a local grocer during my stay .<ssssss>sometimes the doorman be hard to locate when i want to either park my car or get it out of the garage .<ssssss>there be no in room safe .<ssssss>the closet in my room both time i have stay here be small .<ssssss>the cortyard be ok , but i have see much nicer -lrb- and better keep -rrb- at other place i have stay in new orleans.all in all , you will get much more bang for you buck at other hotel in the french quarter -lrb- monteleone , royal sonesta , and a myriad of other place . -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the bottom line be that the soniat house would be a decent place to stay at much reduce rate .<ssssss>i would look elsewhere for accomodation in new orlean .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 5 2 3 2		be careful !<ssssss>this place be really different - and a mixed bag .<ssssss>no stupid rip-off with the mini-bar , lot of terrific extra - all ` free ' and a really great location .<ssssss>but , the breakfast be about as poor a standard as could be imagine , eg scramble egg make by reheat already-made stuff resemble yellow rubber , poor selection etc. this be not what hotel dining room should offer .<ssssss>the safe be break , the phone do not work , and they would only move we to a different room at we expense .<ssssss>the free wifii turn out to last 50 minute and in one room do not work at all .<ssssss>hmmm.the worst part be that we foursome book for 2 day and be force to leave after one due to genuine and serious circumstance beyond we control .<ssssss>we ask -lrb- at breakfast time -rrb- if they would let we off the second night 's charge .<ssssss>the -lrb- young -rrb- guy at the desk be very tough and say he would ` ask he manager ' , later say he do so and be tell ` no ' .<ssssss>i say i expect a more lenient attitude under the circumstance and want to speak to the manager myself and he immediately say ` ok , we will let you off one room but not both .<ssssss>we can not lose money because of you problem . '<ssssss>i later discover that they manage to fill the entire hotel that night but still pocket the room charge they demand from us.i know we have book for 2 night and technically , they may be say to be in the right , but i doubt the manager be even consult and whereas the small thing be what could make this hotel so attractive , know they employ transparently poor actor like he and be happy to ` fine ' we a -lrb- not inexpensive -rrb- room rate they anyway sell to somebody else , make I reluctant to set foot there again or recommend they .<ssssss>you need to feel comfortable in a hotel , but they run it so poorly it spoil the whole experience .<ssssss>
1 1 3 5 2 3 1 5		the worst hilton in we experience we use to love stay at the old hilton.this be we first visit since they rebuild it.we find the facility , when they be open and the quality all well below a 5 star hotel.the hallway have no ventilation and smell musty.they only have one very small coffee shop by reception which can only serve a handful of guest at a time .<ssssss>no alcohol.the restaraunt be only open during breakfast , lunch and dinner.you can not get a drink until bar open around 4-5pm .<ssssss>they close off the swimming pool at 4pm .<ssssss>houskeeping be slack nad they do not have sufficient laundry supplies to give you the towel etc that you expect to have in such a hotel.the quality and quantity of food in the restaraunt be below standard .<ssssss>i have to send a steak back twice as it be tuff.the fianl straw for we be after 3 phone call to assist we with we luggage and 30 minute later we be still wait so struggle out with it ourselves.meanwhile the sheraton just around the round and the westin be both offer excellent service in term of food and facility open .<ssssss>that be we will be stay in future .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 4 1 -1 4		okay but not great for the money vwe have ask for a room with a view and we do get one with a great view.of the lake .<ssssss>the room size be okay but for parent with two teenaer , it be not spacious .<ssssss>there be two sink outside of the bathroom which help with get ready in the morning , there be several thing that we do not like about this hotel .<ssssss>first , the employee at the front desk be not friendly .<ssssss>second , other reviewer have rave about the shuttle .<ssssss>we find it to be a joke .<ssssss>they could not take we when we want to go and they could maybe pick we up but we would have to call ahead to check .<ssssss>there be a baseball game that evening which take priority over people who be not attend .<ssssss>we end up walk to the space needle and after wait awhile we finally get a ride back .<ssssss>the driver do not acknowledge we and be on he cell phone , talk to a friend , most of the ride to the hotel.third , i know that other compliment the breakfast but we stay there 2 night and be at the breakfast each day 15 minute before they close .<ssssss>there be very little food leave unless you could find someone to ask for more .<ssssss>the area be very understaffed .<ssssss>if a hotel post a end time for breakfast , they should have food available until that time!in conclusion , we would not stay at the silver cloud inn again .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 2 1 1		what a dump !!!<ssssss>i be book into this place by my company 's travel agent , and i wish that she have check into it first ... but it be probably the last room downtown available , and the worst i have ever experince .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i will try to be brief and just give a list of the strike against ... but there be many : * it be not a hotel .<ssssss>it be a series of row house property that have be shoddily renovate into apartment at some point in time , then not take care of at all since .<ssssss>* tiny dingy shabby kitchenette , i would not eat anything prepared in it .<ssssss>* tiny dingy shabby bathroom .<ssssss>* tub would not drain , so you get to stand in dirty water when shower .<ssssss>* dingy shabby carpet .<ssssss>* horribly uncomfortable mattress ... seemingly pick up out of a nearby alley .<ssssss>* suppose wireless internet do not work .<ssssss>* wall so thin you can hear conversation in the next unit like they be sit next to you ... literally .<ssssss>* no heat !!!<ssssss>only until the middle of the night , then they shut it off to save $ .<ssssss>this be not a one-time temporary thing .<ssssss>i call to complain and be tell they would have someone look into whether the heat be break .<ssssss>i ask why there be no control for the heat , and be tell that the renter do not pay the utility bill , so why should they control they ?<ssssss>i go ballistic , then be offer $ 50 cash for the inconvenience .<ssssss>then they call back to lie and say that it have be fix ... but the same thing happen every night after i go to bed ... about 55 degree in the am .<ssssss>then i realize they know there be nothing wrong with the heat , and never send anyone to fix it ... they just do not have it on!if there be anything else available i would have go run away .<ssssss>i do not understand how anyone could have such low standard as to give this place a positive review as a few have , unless you have be homeless in the past ... perhaps it be from the management.save yourself !!!<ssssss>
2 1 1 2 2 3 3 1		avoid if at all possible i be not a terribly critical person , but i really hate this hotel .<ssssss>it have some good point - for example , it be cheaper than other option in downtown seattle and it be in a decent location .<ssssss>-lrb- it be not in the center of downtown like the other hotel , but it be only a 5 or 6 block walk -rrb- .<ssssss>however , those be the only positive .<ssssss>the room be very dark and the furniture be really old and mismatched .<ssssss>this give the impression of it be dirty as soon a you walk in .<ssssss>as far as cleanliness , it be just okay - it be the kind of place that make you feel as though you need to check the sheet before crawl into bed .<ssssss>the blanket be really , really wear , but the sheet seem clean .<ssssss>everything else be a crap shoot.my biggest problem with the room be that it be freezing .<ssssss>they have these balcony , which be not mean for actually stand on , which be very drafty and make the room unbearably cold .<ssssss>i turn up the thermostat , but it do not help .<ssssss>and when it actually kick on , the smell that come out of the vent be disgusting .<ssssss>it smell like mold and mildew .<ssssss>we actually turn off the heat and freeze just so we would not be subject to the smell.anyway ... i think this hotel would be okay since i be not plan on be in it very often and i really just need a convenient location to sleep .<ssssss>now that i have stay there i realize it would have be just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provide some comfort .<ssssss>the warwick charge $ 23 , -lrb- i think -rrb- , for parking and $ 12 for internet / per day .<ssssss>by the time you add all the extra , i could have stay at the red lion or hotel monaco for only slightly more .<ssssss>if you be go to seattle , look hard at spend a little extra for another hotel - and you will probably even end up right in the center of downtown .<ssssss>

the w hotel stay be for any friday or saturday night .<ssssss>at first i think it be a mix-up by the charity , and frankly , it be for charity and i do not really care .<ssssss>but after my experience with the arrogant , sloppy and just horrifically bad service at the w , i now wonder if the mistake be theirs.when i realize the room and ticket be incompatible , i decide to use the room as a surprise for the bf .<ssssss>i procure theatre ticket to a sell out show , and call the w to make a reservation .<ssssss>after be on hold for at least 10 minute while the operator try to figure it out , i be send to the 800 number .<ssssss>the 800 operator be not exactly rude , but disinterested , uninformed , and generally ooze negative attitude .<ssssss>she , too , could not figure it out , and it literally take over 1/2 hour to make the reservation.when i make the reservation , i also tell the operator that i want a corner room with a view and would pay whatever it take to upgrade to it .<ssssss>she assure I that i would have a corner room on a high floor with a view , and even after i offer three time to pay for a upgrade , she tell I -lrb- coldly and condescendingly -lrb- difficult to articulate -rrb- -rrb- that it would not be necessary and that i would get my request.you can see where this be go .<ssssss>when we arrive for check in , they give we a corner room on the 5th floor in the back of the building , face the wall of the four season 's garage across a alley .<ssssss>when i speak to the disinterested i be too cool for my job desk clerk , the best i could get be a regular room on a somewhat higher floor , also in the back of the building , this time overlook the same garage by about 10 foot .<ssssss>no apology , no real help , and attitude .<ssssss>by the way -- when i present the ` bearer certificate ' that i discuss with the reservation department for over 30 minute earlier in the day , mr. hip have no idea what to do , call over a apparently more experienced version of himself , and the two of they take 20 minute to , you guess it , figure it out.trying to keep a positive outlook , the bf and i decide to go to earth and ocean , the hotel restaurant .<ssssss>it be a busy saturday night .<ssssss>we stand in a highly trafficked area and be ignore until i be able to stop the greeter , who tell I they be no longer serve in the dining room , but we could order from a bar menu at the bar .<ssssss>then he walk away .<ssssss>i mean , literally -- just walk away without additional comment , leave we to figure out if we should seat ourselves , wait for someone else , or move into the lounge area .<ssssss>after a moment , we be able to stop another staff member who hand we two sticky bar menu while we be still stand in that odd , highly trafficked area , and i swear -- he , too , just walk away without comment .<ssssss>we leave and go to a bistro down the street.the room be okay , albeit dark and face the roof deck of the garage across the alley ; the bathroom be dirty and well below five star standards.we leave the next morning , and the portfolio read zero balance .<ssssss>while i be very disappointed with the attitude and service of the staff from begin to end , think the room be substandard , and have pay several hundred dollar for a package that be not a package , i think i would just let it go and remember that at least the charity make out well.then , of course , i get my credit card bill .<ssssss>yep , you guess it .<ssssss>they charge I for the privilege of be ignore , condescend to , spending -lrb- between the two operator -rrb- over forty-five minute to even make a reservation , and place I in a substandard room with a dirty bathroom .<ssssss>i call they to correct the latest mistake in a series of mistake , and after explain the situation to someone in they reservation department , be forward to the guest service manager .<ssssss>i can not articulate the attitude well at all -- but at least it be consistent .<ssssss>disinterested and arrogant be the best way to describe it .<ssssss>he tell I that he would look into it , and call I back .<ssssss>two day later i get a voicemail from he ask for the charity i purchase the room from , because he could not find the certificate .<ssssss>at this point , i be furious and do not immediately return the call .<ssssss>about a hour later , he call again and tell I he find the certificate and would be refund the $ 230.00 charge to my card .<ssssss>the entire conversation take less than 30 seconds , and end with a curt , perfunctory and insincere apology .<ssssss>period.wow ... just unbelievable .<ssssss>i do not see why anyone would want to stay here .<ssssss>the room be average at best , the bathroom be dirty , and the service be just too hip and arrogant to be anything but worthless .<ssssss>the location be good , poise strategically between the financial and retail district downtown , but so be several other very fine hotel .<ssssss>if you come to seattle , stay in the area , but do not stay at this facility .<ssssss>i can not imagine anyplace that would reflect more poorly on we city .<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 4 3 2 -1		disappoint with misinformation we have just return from we stay at the gran hotel torre catalunya in barcelona .<ssssss>we choose this hotel base on information we read in frommer 's barcelona 2nd edition .<ssssss>frommer 's state that this hotel have add extra such as turn-down service , chocolate on the pillow and free parking and a indoor pool .<ssssss>the reality be that the hotel offer none of these service -lrb- and claim they never have offer these extra -rrb- except for the indoor pool which frommer 's neglect to say be in they sister hotel next door .<ssssss>the hotel do not have a concierge but the front desk or business office will try to help you if they be not too busy .<ssssss>we give they info about hike in a town about 30 mile outside barcelona and ask if they could contact the organization to help we set up this side trip .<ssssss>we want to do this on a sunday .<ssssss>we be tell that it be close on sunday but we could arrange it for monday .<ssssss>later we be tell it be not open on monday and also there be no way to get to this town -lrb- previously we be tell we could take the train -rrb- .<ssssss>it be one thing to not offer help in arrange activity but it be another thing to give out false , and at best , mislead information .<ssssss>needless to say we be not please with the service provide by this highly recommend frommer 's hotel .<ssssss>

1 3 3 3 4 1 2 -1		recommendation : look elsewhere for special occasion my wife and i stay at this hotel on two separate occasion from 5/30 -6 / 2 and the night of 6/6 .<ssssss>we be not impress by the hotel at all .<ssssss>the check-in experience both time be slow and the upgrade i be give as a platinum marriott reward member with over 130 marriott night last year be not acceptable .<ssssss>they do indicate that i get upgrade to a executive room , but it be in fact just a two balcony partial ocean / city view room .<ssssss>they be able to bring the price down to the elite rate , but they policy be to give you a upgrade to platinum member at all cost .<ssssss>this marriott do not have a concierge lounge , even though i have be tell they have one .<ssssss>he concierge people at the hotel be very poor .<ssssss>one lady recommend a restaurant that she indicate be a short walking distance away but it be at least a half mile away and not a place you would walk through at night -lrb- towards diamond head -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel be close to shopping and dining , but this be not really a perk as all the hotel be close to dining , and in fact , the marriott be actually a bit away from all the other area and finer dining and shopping .<ssssss>i could go on a on about the poor service at the pool-side bar , the non-helpful concierge , the slow and unfriendly check-in personel but i do not have the time .<ssssss>do you self a favor and spend the extra $ 50-100 a night and stay a a much better place that have a nice restaurant , better pool , better room , friendly staff with a better concierge .<ssssss>stay away at this hotel at all cost .<ssssss>this be come from someone who be a diehard of marriott and be a loyal follower .<ssssss>there be something wrong with the management of this hotel and they do not cater to they guest .<ssssss>my suspicion be that they do not make there money on repeat business and they do marriott vacation and tour and nothing else .<ssssss>the only good thing i can say about the hotel be the bell hop and valet guy , they be helpful in gettt cab , tell I how to get diamond head , etc.one last thing , i have stay at other marriott in the we and in europe and this hotel do not match they standard .<ssssss>i have see other people accustom to marriott state this as well on this hotel , so do not expect much from this marriott .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 3 3 1 -1		i be sad to say that i will never stay here again !<ssssss>let I start by say that this be my third stay at this hotel -lrb- i love it the first two time -rrb- and that i book my stay directly with the hotel rather than one of the discount site .<ssssss>you should also know that i speak fluent french so there be never a misunderstanding due to a language barrier .<ssssss>first of all , the bed be hard as rock and instead of bed pillow , they only have sham on the bed - a big change from my last stay .<ssssss>the concierge ' recommendation for restaurant be in most case not worthwhile choice .<ssssss>more importantly , beware of the practice of some of the concierge to make arrangement with the hotel car driver to rip you off for local cab ride .<ssssss>we have agree on a 30 euro price one night , -lrb- there be 5 of we -rrb- but be charge 50 euro when we get back to the hotel !<ssssss>farouq -lrb- the head concierge -rrb- meet with I , apologize , and say that he know the concierge should not try to rip off tthe customer by conspire with the car driver to pad the bill so they can make extra money , but beyond he apology , nothing else happen .<ssssss>after that , i call for we own cab .<ssssss>when we check out , we be charge for internet service in we room -lrb- when we have no computer with we !! -rrb-<ssssss>and over 35 euro for long-distance phone call which we do not make -lrb- as we use only we cell phone to make satellite call -rrb- .<ssssss>they take off the computer charge , but not the phone call .<ssssss>when i return home , i e-mailed and write the general manager of the hotel -lrb- in french -rrb- and ask for a refund .<ssssss>i never even receive a response , let alone a refund .<ssssss>the view and location be wonderful , but for the price of this hotel , i will stay somewhere else next time -- the splendid no longer live up to its name !!!<ssssss>

2 5 2 5 4 4 4 3		too much cobstruction i agree with the reviewer before I .<ssssss>we have the exact same room set-up .<ssssss>my bathroom and shower be just as bad .<ssssss>however , the shower be a normal size , not the puny little one , some reviewer say it be .<ssssss>the room be also a regular size room .<ssssss>it may have be just a little narrower .<ssssss>the furniture room be very retro .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable .<ssssss>the hall look like they have be redone.i have a city view room and i could see the construction from my lanai .<ssssss>the work begin at 7:00 and i could hear everything .<ssssss>however , the pool beach be on the other side and there be no construction noise there .<ssssss>the pool be great for the kid .<ssssss>there be plenty of chaise lounge available .<ssssss>the beach be a little small .<ssssss>if you have a ocean view room you will be fine .<ssssss>we have no problem with valet parking and all the worker at the hotel be very nice .<ssssss>the lobby be great .<ssssss>drive in and out of the hotel be a maze of one way street .<ssssss>walk be a zig-zag trek through the construction .<ssssss>i should have re-booked another hotel .<ssssss>however , for the value , it be not bad at all !<ssssss>we be close to everything .<ssssss>i would stay here again when the construction be over .<ssssss>
2 3 2 -1 2 -1 4 -1		great location , but ... .<ssssss>i have book 3 day in this inn and 2 day at another hotel ... be it my first time in singapore , i like to make sure i be not stick with only one hotel .<ssssss>i be so glad i have only book 3 day here and 2 day at a luxury hotel .<ssssss>i mean the inn be located in a absolutely great location in chinatown , near the bustling shop market , food hawker , and mtr station to get to all the other neighborhood .<ssssss>quaint look lobby .<ssssss>the only thing be i have stay in a single room consist of a twin bed , decent size bathroom , and a closet ... that be about it ... no window , dim light and guess what , i have to kill 3 baby roach during my 3 day stay on different day .<ssssss>i be uncomfortable with my bed sheet and cover ... kinda moldy ... so i do not really have a relaxing sleep in this environment.if you be not plan to stay in you room too long , this inn be ok for that ... just make sure to seal you stuff every time you leave , just in case a baby one might want to hop along on you trip with you .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 4 2 4 -1		great location - room ok as other reviewer have rightly state , the best aspect of this hotel be it be location .<ssssss>great for get to all the tourist spots.whilst we be at the hotel upgrade work be take place to both the inside and outside of the building , whilst these do not disturb we it do leave the hotel look messy -lrb- both outside and along the landing be room be be work on -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be comfortable and we be lucky enough to get into one of the refurbish room .<ssssss>not a massive difference between the refurbish room .<ssssss>the view from we room be straight into the office block behind the hotel , but we do not mind as we do not spend much time in there.my only complaint would be the fact that the front desk staff book we a taxi to take we back to the airport that never turn up and we end up flagging one off the street -lrb- eventually ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>
2 1 3 3 4 4 4 -1		not worth the price i have stay at several w across the we and be excite to stay here to celebrate my 30th birthday .<ssssss>however , after read these review , my expectation be pretty low .<ssssss>the good - this be one of the better look w i have stay in .<ssssss>a lot seem to be dark and small , but this one be very spacious and have great light and color .<ssssss>the bliss spa be also nice , but a little overpriced for dallas spa .<ssssss>the sweat gym by larry north be fantastic - great machine and variety , even though no one be in there .<ssssss>the valet and staff member be helpful and pleasant.the bad - i really think this hotel be overprice for what you get .<ssssss>we book a package deal that include about 5 do this and get this for free item , but i only take advantage of 2 .<ssssss>the pool be pretty to look at , but you can not find a seat and it be in total shade .<ssssss>the water be freezing and no one could bare to step in .<ssssss>probably the biggest draw for this place be the ghostbar .<ssssss>we be tell to line up in the hotel vip line by at 11:30 to get in , but do not believe that .<ssssss>we get down on a sit .<ssssss>night around 9:30 and still have to wait about 30 min .<ssssss>to go up .<ssssss>grant , the view be pretty awesome when you get there , but it be not as great as the line would lead you to believe .<ssssss>as a previous poster say , if you be look for the hip atmosphere without break the bank , i prefer the zaza over the w.<ssssss>

2 1 1 4 3 2 1 3		keep look the location of the sheraton be the reason we choose to stay here .<ssssss>i have never stay in a room that be so loud in my life .<ssssss>we room be in the newer tower that face the international market .<ssssss>not only could we hear loud music until late into the night , it sound like we be in the middle of a construction site with dump and delivery truck show up at the crack of dawn .<ssssss>not to mention that we could hear everything go o in the room next to we .<ssssss>after the 4th day of no sleep , i go to tell the manager who would not even come out to speak to I and tell the front desk clerk that if i want to move , i would have to pay more money .<ssssss>i end up call they corporate office to complain and the manager call I on my cell phone and tell I i could move at no charge .<ssssss>you could still hear noise on the other side of the hotel , but not as loud and the music break up much earlier at night .<ssssss>there be nothing special about the room at all , from what the staff themselves tell we , the food be nothing to rave about , so we never do eat there .<ssssss>we do enjoy meeting for drink by the pool in the evening .<ssssss>they have live entertainment nightly , however , you will spend plenty of time wait for cocktail service out there .<ssssss>one night we make the huge mistake of take in the hotel 's comedy show .<ssssss>it be horrific and sooooo not worth the money .<ssssss>i do not know where they dig these people up from , but it be a huge rip off .<ssssss>if you want to use they hotel gym , you have to go to a different sheraton and pay money .<ssssss>also , i feel that the $ 20 a day to park be outrageous , but in all honostly i be not sure how that compare to other hotel .<ssssss>the conceirge only want to make reservation at restaurant where he would benefit from make the call himself .<ssssss>for the almost $ 1400 we pay for 7 night ... i would definitely keep look around .<ssssss>if you feel you will need sleep at all , you would be better off stay somewhere else .<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 3 4 4 5		ok , but poor sound isolation book two double the acro for two night as a late choice , the bellevue be fully book and other central hotel just be so much more expensive give the decline of the pound against the euro .<ssssss>as usual for this price range in amsterdam the double room be tiny , only one person be able to move around at a time , but clean and comfortable .<ssssss>shower room be ok , but so cramped use of the wc be difficult and a non-mixer style shower mean that constant adjustment be require .<ssssss>overall the hotel be a tad on the shabby side , particularly the lift and stair , but there be a clean spacious breakfast room that could cope with the nine oâ€™clock rush !<ssssss>breakfast be include in the room price , and be a a very adequate selection of cold meat , cheese , bread , breakfast cereal and excellent coffee .<ssssss>staff be friendly and helpful throughout we stay.we be concern at large stag party booking in ahead of we , particularly as the hotel boast a 24-hour bar , but the management be very quick to resolve noise issue -lrb- hip-hop music in the adjacent room on a stag party return at 05:30 on sunday morning -rrb- .<ssssss>this highlight the worst aspect of this hotel , the almost total lack of sound insulation between room .<ssssss>location be not ideal for the central area , be a tram stop from leidseplein , but tram be very regular so not really a problem up to around 00:30 â€?and the rijksmuseum be literally a minute walk away.overall reasonable value for money , and would certainly stay again , but give a choice i would plump for the bellevue which be a similar price but more central , more recently refurbish and have better inter-room acoustic isolation .<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 5 5 4 5		good place if you like hard bed we stay here after read tripadvisor review .<ssssss>we like the idea of free parking , do not want to be near union square , and do not want to spend a lot of money .<ssssss>the location be good , just off van ness , with bus close by , and cable car within a few block .<ssssss>everything be indeed very clean .<ssssss>parking be tight , so we rent a very small car and have no problem .<ssssss>do not depend on the continental breakfast - it be just a few roll in plastic .<ssssss>the room be outdate , but would have be ok , except for the bed .<ssssss>rock hard .<ssssss>now , we know we be not stay in a luxury hotel , so we expectation be not high , but there be really no excuse for a bad bed .<ssssss>the room be noisy , as people mention - try to get on the 2nd floor - we have one of those heavy walker above we .<ssssss>i might stay here again , if i be rent a car , because other hotel charge 38-40 a day , but only if i know they have upgrade the bed .<ssssss>a backache be not worth it .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 3 3 5 3		read the review with care they might just help you out well after book the holiday and -lrb- hotel allocate on arrival -rrb- we suss out the three hotel it could be.all be give a 4t or even a 4t + -lrb- thomson platinum -rrb- and to we dismay all three have bad report but my partner and myself be seasoned traveller so we make allowance here and there take into account that some people want the earth for next to ` nowt.so after a bit of a rough ride from the airport in a slightly boneshaker of a bus we reach the hotel .<ssssss>you really need a map to guide you round the place till you can get you bearing , we room smell of damp and be like this for the first week till it be air , small insect come out from various place to get at any scap of sugar spill from make cofee , this all pail into insignificance when i talk about the food which be well present and a good variety but be never serve hot only slightly warm , this be the case in all the restaurant we try and even after take care both myself and partner go down with possible food poision my partner on the second day myself on the third , we be unable to shake this off and have it for the duration of we holiday -lrb- two week -rrb- .<ssssss>the staff be always pleasant and some go out of they way to make the stay enjoyable , so here be the warning take plenty of imodiom or suchlike and make sure you pay the excess on you travel insurance -lrb- if you need to be hospitalize -rrb- as one woman be while we be there.this be not a isolate case as many of the guest in the hotel be complain about stomach upset .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 4 5 -1 3		work well for I i need a hotel close to the moscone convention center .<ssssss>when this pop up in a search , at about half the price of most of the surround facility , i be intrigue and a little bit leary .<ssssss>the review here and elsewhere do not really calm my fear .<ssssss>but , for three night and with few other option within a reasonable budget , i decide to take a chance.when i be there , only a couple of floor have room open while renovation continue on the upper floor .<ssssss>my room on the second floor be small by contemporary american standard -lrb- and include only a small nightstand and a empty armoire with just enough space to walk around the bed -rrb- .<ssssss>but this be , after all , a very old building and the space be fine for one or two people if you be not spend a lot of time in the room -lrb- and why would you in san francisco ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i have see similarly size room in older hotel in nyc and european city , so i guess size perception be a matter of location and expectation .<ssssss>and some of the room be larger -lrb- a colleague who travel with I have much more space -rrb- .<ssssss>the bathroom be about average size and the closet be actually somewhat spacious , although there be no dresser or drawer in the armoire so i wind up leave some of my clothes in my suitcase on the rack in the closet .<ssssss>again , it be okay by myself but would have be a irritant if my wife have be travel with me.my room be not overlook the street , which may explain why it be relatively quiet at night .<ssssss>morning be another story ... renovation work begin about 7 a.m. most morning , lot of banging .<ssssss>on a work trip , i be up anyway .<ssssss>if i would be on vacation , i probably would have be out of there after the first night.the staff be very friendly , and helpful with the couple of small question i asked.all in all , a mixed bag right now .<ssssss>whether it would be a reasonably comfortable bargain in a otherwise expensive market -lrb- my experience -rrb- or a nightmare would depend on you need and expectation .<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 5 2 1 -1		iberostar - disappointed !<ssssss>we stay at the iberostar , punta cana .<ssssss>my husband and i travel with we 3?1/2 year old and i be really disappoint by the accommodation and the food .<ssssss>i have do a lot of travel but this be my husband first trip to the carribbean , i feel sorry for him.the hotel itself be beautiful - the grounds and beach be immaculate - that be about all the good thing i can say .<ssssss>room : the room be large enough but have multiple problem .<ssssss>the t.v.

4 3 5 5 5 5 5 1		in transition we go to dream on december 20 for 8 night to celebrate we 20th wedding anniversary .<ssssss>we book a honeymoon suite .<ssssss>the facility be still sunscape when we check in but be officially dream two day later.as other review indicate , the hotel be a good hour from the airport , so factor that in .<ssssss>many of the road have pothole as deep as the grand canyon and as large as rhode island -lrb- ok , i be stretch it -rrb- , so take you dramamine if you be squeamish.the van drive up a long , impressive driveway , and a porter in a pith helmet -lrb- i swear -rrb- come up with cold washcloth and say welcome home .<ssssss>i think this be they signature greet .<ssssss>anyway , we bag and the check-in be handle without incident , and this porter , henry , be quite exceptional.there be 9 residential building , sort of lay out like chevron \ / to maximize the view .<ssssss>we suite be in building 9 , closest to the main building , farthest from the ocean -lrb- this resort be on the atlantic -rrb- .<ssssss>we be a bit unhappy about that but as the week wear on ; we find it to be a good thing .<ssssss>the suite be on the outside of the chevron , mean that we face toward the ocean , away from the property .<ssssss>this be a big advantage because it be much quieter , although there be a service road for employee run along the side.while we be there , they be do a lot of masonry work , which will definitely improve the appearance of the place , but be a bit inconvenient for we .<ssssss>there be a lovely pool that meander through the facility .<ssssss>you can not swim from one end to the other because there be a dam of sort in the middle - i never find out why .<ssssss>the pool be all tile , uniformly 3 foot deep , and immaculate .<ssssss>there be plenty of lounge chair , both along the pool and on the beach .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful , with soft sand .<ssssss>i find it well maintain from end to end , and be surprise that there be review that call it rocky .<ssssss>perhaps as part of the transition they repair this.there be plenty of activity during the day , although they be not always well organize .<ssssss>there be the explorer 's club , a kind of day camp/day care center for kid , and separate activity for teens .<ssssss>at night there be always show in the theater at 9:30 pm , usually with loud recorded music and choreograph dancing , less frequently with live music .<ssssss>there be a postage stamp size casino .<ssssss>the dealer tend to the amateurish , but be as likely to make a mistake in you favor as one against you.our honeymoon suite consist of two room .<ssssss>you walk into a living area with a couch , loveseat , coffee table , and armoire with a tv .<ssssss>there be a large -lrb- not walk-in -rrb- closet with a iron and iron board stow .<ssssss>there be a mini-bar area that be stock with beer , coke , diet coke , and sprite as well as bottled water .<ssssss>the bottled water be a local brand which have a bit of a chlorine taste that disappear as you get use to it .<ssssss>it would not sell very well in the we , but it be literally eau de vie here , where the tap water be contaminate and unsafe.the bedroom , which be similar to other room we see , have a king-size canopy bed .<ssssss>the mattress be very firm .<ssssss>there be no cover for the canopy so the ceiling fan could do its thing -lrb- there be also a fan in the living room -rrb- .<ssssss>there be another armoire with another tv .<ssssss>the tv channel be plentiful and include all we network , but the network outlet be , inexplicably , denver .<ssssss>the bedroom open to the dress area which contain two sink , plenty of amenity -lrb- soap , shampoo , toothbrush , shaving , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>the dress area have a large walk-in closet on one side -lrb- if you can not find a home for you stuff here , you bring too much -rrb- .<ssssss>the other side of the dress room have a door to the lavatory which consist of a commode and a walk-in shower .<ssssss>this be a european style shower , with a transitional space outside the water flow .<ssssss>the pressure be excellent , and the shower be a hand-held one that be mount on a adjustable rod .<ssssss>the living room have a slide door that open to a veranda .<ssssss>i would say we veranda be over 20 foot long .<ssssss>the regular veranda be about half that .<ssssss>the veranda have a plastic table and two plastic chair .<ssssss>there be a large jacuzzi on the far end .<ssssss>we use this a lot and it be great .<ssssss>it only take about 20 minute to fill.in general , the room be lovely but there be minor issue , like a rusty closet rod , chip paint , and a couple of warped ceiling tile that prevent this place from be a 5-star facility .<ssssss>maybe the transition include plan repair that will improve it.now for the food .<ssssss>the default be the world cafe , a huge buffet with a wide variety of food .<ssssss>there be a italian place within the world cafe , kind of a pizza and pasta place .<ssssss>also in the main building be himatsu , part teppenyakus , part chinese , and the patio , a mexican restaurant adjacent to the world cafe.in another building by the ocean , there be 3 restaurant .<ssssss>on the second floor be bordeaux -lrb- formerly dream -rrb- , a adults-only continental style restaurant .<ssssss>on the ground level be oceana , with a seafood emphasis and the seaside grill , with a meat emphasis .<ssssss>none of the prepared food be particularly good .<ssssss>some of it be ok ; a lot be overcooked and/or oversauced .<ssssss>seafood and shrimp in particular , seem to get better treatment than meat and fowl .<ssssss>the chinese food be actually bizarre and make I pine for la choy !<ssssss>there be no actual asian employee -lrb- that i could see -rrb- in the asian restaurant .<ssssss>on the upside , the fruit be wonderful , some of the seafood dish be quite good , and there be plenty to eat .<ssssss>only the world be open for 3 meal .<ssssss>the seaside grill be also open for lunch .<ssssss>there be a daily lunch barbeque on the beach , and all the other be dinner only.we be unlikely to return to this place , mainly because of the hassle of travel here from the southwestern we , but the weather and the service be wonderful , and it be a really lovely place .<ssssss>because of the spread-out nature , plus a lack of elevator , i would not recommend it to anybody with major physical disability , although they do accommodate such .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 1 3 1 -1		beware - mouse !!!<ssssss>i book this hotel purely on the basis of the rating i see with tripadvisor and when i arrive i thought - yes this be nice - room good size , facility fine and location not too bad .<ssssss>this change very quickly when i return to the hotel on the first night -lrb- friday -rrb- for a few drink before retire .<ssssss>a while after we first drink , my husband start to say something to I but stop - to which i pay no heed until he realise a little later that two woman beside we have see what he be about to tell I about - mouse - run freely around the bar area .<ssssss>we mention this to the bar and restaurant staff and they response be amazing .<ssssss>they be totally aware of it and be prepare to do nothing about it - one of they ask do we expect they to kill a animal .<ssssss>the girl deal with the restaurant be extremely rude say that as long as it be not rat she do not care .<ssssss>when i point out that the mouse could run around glass , pourer on the bottle , nut that be be give out she just say there be no mouse in the kitchen which i tell she i do not believe .<ssssss>we watch the mouse come in and out through a gap in the internal wall so i can only imagine that they be in other place throughout the hotel .<ssssss>the duty manager eventually come over and try to diffuse the issue but we just leave after a heated discussion as he maintain he do not know the mouse be there even though the bar and restaurant staff be fully aware of it - i do not think so .<ssssss>as we see three in the space of a hour , i would imagine theres quite a few more in they comfortable little breeding ground .<ssssss>the next morning , we recieve a very small box of sweet - as in the size of a box of card - as a apology - do not go too far at make we feel like we want to stay in the hotel as all i could think of be what if they be in the air conditioning system and one of they join I in bed !<ssssss>also when we go down to go out for we breakfast - be i glad i have room only or what !<ssssss>- the breakfast be be serve in the bar area where the mouse have free reign the previous night.apart from that the hotel itself would have be fine - and the concierge be very nice and helpful but i will not be go back there again - kinda take alot of the good of a rare weekend away from the kid .<ssssss>

3 2 1 4 2 4 3 2		overrated - just ok i can not believe all of the stunning review this place get .<ssssss>it be very very average .<ssssss>con : the room be extremely small ... feel more like a tiney bedroom than a hotel room .<ssssss>at first glance the room look clean , however i feel like i could not walk around and shower without flip flop .<ssssss>we sink be clog and take a while to drain each time we use it .<ssssss>breakfast be terrible .<ssssss>basically it be a tray of ham and cheese , yogurt , croissant -lrb- which have mold on it -rrb- and juice.pros : front desk be nice and helpful.they allow we to shower and change in the hotel when we get back from the beach after we check out -lrb- have a late flight -rrb- location be pretty good .<ssssss>about 3 block from a ok beach .<ssssss>condado beach be not a typical carribean beach .<ssssss>some trash scatter around , water be not calm ... lot of wave .<ssssss>no big deal ... just a fyi.doing this trip again i would stay at the marriott -lrb- one block away from coral princess -rrb- .<ssssss>it be beach front and much nicer inside .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 2 3 1 2		dont stay here this hotel be terrible - do not stay here under any circumstances.i have the mis fortune of stay here for 6 night .<ssssss>6 night of hell .<ssssss>the air conditioning dosent work - moscito in the room - bad mannered staff and the list continue ... i dont normally rant but do not stay here .<ssssss>
5 5 4 3 5 4 5 2		hotel meet we expectation , storm exceed they my husband and i stay at this hotel for 4 night at the start of we trip to china , and one night prior to leave .<ssssss>we choose the holiday inn central plaza after study trip advisor .<ssssss>the hotel room be well furnished , spotless , with fairly comfortable bed .<ssssss>two bottle of water , and usually 2 pice of fruit be complimentary daily .<ssssss>we have several meal at the main restaurant , the buffet choice be comprehensive and tasty , but do seem a little expensive .<ssssss>one night we choose from the menu but we be both disappointed with the qualitywe have the perfectly adequate ` two egg ' room service breakfast -lrb- coffee extra -rrb- several time , the cost be reasonable , and the egg be usually still hot on arrival .<ssssss>the location of the hotel be ok , we find it very interesting go for walk to check out the neighbourhood .<ssssss>there be a nice bakery a short walk to the left of the hotel , bottled water/soft drink be very cheap locally -lrb- approx 100yd to right -rrb- .<ssssss>taxi be very easy to find , and we be only turn down once one evening .<ssssss>the hotel be well staff , they be very polite , and most have a reasonable command of english.we have read many positive comment about storm , we be please when he introduce himself to we on we second day , and ask how he could help .<ssssss>the next day he arrange a pedicab ride from the hotel to the hutong to finish with peking duck lunch .<ssssss>that evening he arrange ticket for the excellent acrobatic show .<ssssss>when we return to the hotel for the second time he arrange a driver to meet we at the airport , and detour via the olympic stadium which we have want to see.storm really go up in we estimation when he take time out of he busy day to accompany we to catch a train to zhengzhou .<ssssss>it be a huge relief to have he guide we through the massive beijing west station .<ssssss>when we discover we have be book on the slow instead of the fast train he manage to find 2 people to exchange train with we !<ssssss>lastly he help we onto the train and make sure we be able to sit together .<ssssss>we just feel so grateful to he for all he help .<ssssss>there be a world of difference between someone who say have a nice day and storm , who take the extra trouble and time to make sure it be .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 3 -1 -1		beware ventilation / air quality issue we have originally intend to stay 5 night at this hotel which be just a couple of block from waikiki beach and offer a great view of the surf .<ssssss>however , when we enter we room we be hit with a strong mold odor and could see mold along the top and bottom of the wall between the bathroom and main space .<ssssss>when we try to call down to the front desk to report the problem the phone do not work .<ssssss>we drag we luggage back down to the front desk and be give another room .<ssssss>this room smell better but still have a slight odor and visible evidence of past water damage .<ssssss>we know ahead of time that the hotel be undergo renovation and will not allow guest to open the slide door to the balcony .<ssssss>however , we have not realize the balcony door offer the only available fresh air source above the lobby level .<ssssss>this do not help the obvious moisture issue .<ssssss>the air quality be so bad we hardly sleep , feel ill and check out the follow morning .<ssssss>the hotel lobby , which include a bar and seating area , have already be renovate and might be a nice place to be if it have decent lighting .<ssssss>the front desk staff be okay .<ssssss>the valet staff be rather agressive - we have 4 people on we car the first moment we pull in and find it a bit much .<ssssss>we will not be go back .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 4 3 1 4		substandard experience i , too , be mystified as to why the review of this hotel be so positive .<ssssss>i expect the service to be as good as what previous reviewer have say that it would be but find it to be quite mediocre .<ssssss>the front desk staff be business-like but not particularly friendly .<ssssss>the service at the cafe andre be actually poor during we stay .<ssssss>also , the decor of we room be somewhat worn , and the noise from the street at night necessitate the use of earplug in order to have any chance of get a good night 's sleep .<ssssss>and the shower keep turn off repeatedly while in use , which be annoying .<ssssss>with so many wonderful hotel from which to choose in san francisco , the hotel rex certainly give I no reason to return .<ssssss>
3 3 4 2 5 4 5 4		nice and comfortable hotel but in not a great location .<ssssss>the standard room<ssssss>
1 1 2 4 3 5 2 -1		not if you want a good night sleep !!<ssssss>i agree with the other reviewer it be a lovely hotel and in a great location and the room be nicely do but none of this overlook thefact that there be no soundproofing at all in the hotel and you can hear every single thing that go on , it be just not acceptable in a hotel that bill itself at five star.we arrive late on a thurs night -lrb- about 10 -rrb- and go straight to dinner , it be late when we get back so be look forward to sleep until at least nine the next morning , this be not possible.we be on the first floor and from six o'clock that morning we be awake with the sound of people walk overhead and toilet flushing , we end up get up at eight which do not make we happy -lrb- on a childfree weekend so wanted to sleep for a while -rrb- .<ssssss>i ask reception to move we to a top floor room but they be fully book so in the end we have no option but to move hotel that morninga we could not put up with the noise for another three morning .<ssssss>in addition we room overlook a apartment block where there be wash hang out from the window which do not improve the situation.so whilst there be a lot of good point about this hotel for I none of they outweigh the fact that you can not sleep past six in the morning , i just do not find find that acceptable and would not recommend the hotel on this basis .<ssssss>

1 1 2 5 3 1 1 -1		i be sorry to have be such a inconvenience !<ssssss>wow , the idea of a boutique hotel seem so romantic , do not it ?<ssssss>away from the mainstream , off the corporate conveyor belt , no loyalty card or be upsold to spa package at every opportunity ... what boutique seem to translate to - at least with this hotel - be complete lack of service or comfort .<ssssss>in fact , i would like to apologise to the staff of the kirketon for be such a inconveniece !<ssssss>firstly , to the gentleman that check we in : i so do hope that show we to we room -lrb- no , do not worry about take we bags - we will lug they up two flight off stair ourselves -rrb- mean that you do not miss out on you ebay auction .<ssssss>and i be truly sorry for be so uninformed to as sydney geography to even * dare * to ask direction to oxford street - how silly of I not to bring my tomtom -lrb- at rude and aloof receptionist , turn right and walk 200 metre ... -rrb- .<ssssss>gosh , you would think i would walk into the rsl and ask where the beer was.and to cap it off , check out be less than a breeze , where say receptionist do not acknowledge we in the slightest and instead spend he - albeit * very * valuable time - talk with another staff member regard which staff drink he want to comp off he tab .<ssssss>after dump the key on the front desk , the parting salvo from front desk ?<ssssss>hey , what room be you in ?<ssssss>but you know what ?<ssssss>i be not sorry for this one ... that be just woeful service .<ssssss>if only the heart ache stop there .<ssssss>grant , the hotel be be close for refurbishment the day after we be leave , but really ?<ssssss>that be how you keep up with the time ?<ssssss>who use a vcr these day ?<ssssss>cavemen ?<ssssss>no , apparently the kirketon 's hotel 's patron .<ssssss>i love the special touch as well - the fact that the vcr be * duct tape * -lrb- no joke ! -rrb-<ssssss>to the underside of the circa 1992 television .<ssssss>i must admit , that i do have a giggle at the hifi system .<ssssss>here i be look for a jack for my ipod , when i should have go into my attic and brush off my cassette collection.if only i have read the review post on this site prior to booking .<ssssss>the only thing worse than a establishment that do not acknowledge feedback be a establishment that respond to feedback and do nothing about see management response.oh well , back to the hilton for me.cheers , chri bp.s .<ssssss>i do forget to mention that we do receive good service .<ssssss>after have we key disabled since we be 10 minute late for check out -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>, the cleaning lady be lovely and let we in .<ssssss>or be that just another symptom of the rot that match the decor ?<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 5 4 3		friendly staff , but smell like a sewer like other traveller mention before : very friendly staff , good location 100 m from bell and drum tower and close -lrb- but not too close -rrb- to the nightlife/restaurants/hutongs around the nearby lakes.however do not expect the room to be like they look on the hotel website .<ssssss>biggest problem be the strong sewer smell in the room .<ssssss>this originate from the fact that no siphon be use to connect sink etc to the sewage system.ok breakfast .<ssssss>
3 3 5 -1 4 -1 1 -1		i would go back there ... but just for the beach we have just return from a very relaxing 1 week stay at breeze .<ssssss>we go there with a open mind after read some of the review and be overall pleased with the hotel .<ssssss>we encounter a few of the problem that other guest have note on this review site , but generally there be nothing that i would say be cause for complaint.the room be spacious and ours have a great view of the garden and part of the beach -lrb- even though we do not pay for a sea view !!! -rrb-<ssssss>the room be always well clean and towel change as and when request - you do need to leave they in the bath though , they do not just change they daily unless you want they change !!<ssssss>the grounds of the hotel be immaculate - there must have be more maintenance staff than guest there because day and night we see staff busy keep the grounds clean and presentable.the beach ... one of the best i have ever see .<ssssss>the sea be always warm - a little rough at time , always keep one eye on the wave come in behind you and do not get catch out like i do and get knock over by one !<ssssss>-lrb- i be sure it be not healthy to drink as muck seawater as i do that afternoon ! -rrb-<ssssss>if you prefer a little piece and quiet while sun yourself , stay to the left of the water sport centre - there be no more than 15 sun loungerâ€™s down that end .<ssssss>the other end of the beach , nearest the pool end of the hotel be much noisier with lot of kids.the pool be ok , the service at the swim up bar be very slow .<ssssss>the pool area do get quite rowdy come about 3pm with the entertainment people do game , play music etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i love the fact that one of the larger restaurant be situate right on the pool side , so it be never far to walk for a snack or a drink .<ssssss>the food at this restaurant be generally ok , the bbq food be quite often very dry and taste like it have be sit on the grill a while.the lobby bar be quite often very busy in the evening and it be often very hard to get serve .<ssssss>we prefer to go to the beach bar by the pool , it be much quieter down there and you would be serve immediately - the staff down there actually look happy and relax unlike some of the other staff around the hotel .<ssssss>like the service and food in the restaurant , it be very hit and miss with the staff .<ssssss>some could not do enough for you , some would not even acknowledge you!the main restaurant - alcazar -lrb- we keep call it alcatraz because basically you can imagine that the food the serve in there be of the same standard they would serve in prison !!! -rrb-<ssssss>there be little choice for such a big restaurant and the table allocation be a disaster !!<ssssss>you have to go in and take what ever table be empty and clean - which be hard to do .<ssssss>so you end up spending quite a while wonder around try to find somewhere to eat .<ssssss>and when you do eventually sit down , you can be expect to wait up to 20 min to get some drink serve !<ssssss>the food be quite often bland and dry .<ssssss>if you can , try and get book in to either the japanese or the italian restaurant - the service and the food be outstanding in both of these .<ssssss>we do also visit the french restaurant , and the service here be terrible .<ssssss>food be ok , but nothing special.the food and drink aspect , although quite a important one be the only let down at this hotel .<ssssss>we keep remind ourselves of the amount of people they cater for on a daily basis , but they should not be class as a 4 * if they can not keep to those standard expect .<ssssss>overall the hotel itself meet we expectation and we do have a very nice time .<ssssss>but the food and the service be a big let down .<ssssss>personally i would not return to this hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		wish we stay at the uma or begawan girus !<ssssss>long story short ... feel in love with ubud , less than impressed with the fs sayan.we stay here for 5 night two week ago .<ssssss>think we be go to have a relaxing holiday until we hear the first wave of rafter .<ssssss>for those that want peace , quiet and seclusion , do not request a riverfront villa !<ssssss>for hour in the morning you will hear whitewater rafter scream they lung out .<ssssss>this may not bother some people but it certainly bother us.part of the reason why we stay at the fs sayan be because of the view we keep hear about .<ssssss>wish we do more research before we go because we go to the begawan giri for lunch and the view be about 100 time better than the fs sayan !<ssssss>first off , it be hard to compare the two resort because the giri be just so much nicer than the sayan .<ssssss>the grounds be amazing ... acre and acre of natural beauty , and the eye can see for mile along deep , deep river gorge on both side of you !<ssssss>the sayan river gorge seem like a trench compare to the giri 's .<ssssss>another thing that jump out at I be how distinctive the architecture and the furnishings the begawan giri 's be compare to the fs sayan .<ssssss>i tell you something , if you be stay at the fs and do not want to ruin you trip like we do , do not visit the begawan girus .<ssssss>man , be we depress look at the city hotel-style furniture of we villa after witness the african-inspired furnishings of the fire house -lrb- i think that be what it be call -rrb- or the outdoor japanese bath of the water house.getting a suite in one of the begawan giri 's residence be roughly the same price as a villa at the fs sayan , yet the occupancy be so low that i be tell we could have have a entire residence to ourselves !<ssssss>this mean a real private pool , not those tiny dip fountain that we had.lest you think we be real snob that only want to stay in we $ 1k room a night , we also find a small boutique hotel that have cheap rate that we still like better than the fs !<ssssss>it be call the uma ubud and it be gorgeous !<ssssss>very minimalistic , but island-flavored furnishings ... imagine what a futuristic sci-fi balinese room would be like and you have get the uma .<ssssss>just a gorgeous hotel.sounds expensive , right ?<ssssss>we $ 200 per night for a standard , but very pretty room .<ssssss>$ 350 get a suite with a private pool ... not only nicer than the fs but cheaper too.why do not we move out ?<ssssss>wish we could have but we -lrb- over -rrb- pay for the 5 night f sayan stay at a charity auction back in the us.i like to see a silver lining in everything and certainly in this case , the next time i be in balus , i will know where to stay !<ssssss>

4 4 3 3 5 3 4 2		good experience overall i just get back from a few night stay at this hotel , which i choose after read all the glowing review at tripadvisor .<ssssss>the reviewer be spot on in prep I for the up and downs of this hotel .<ssssss>i stay near the needle when in seattle last year and have do some explore then and have figure out the city somewhat , so be curious about stay in the u district and be not disappoint with that choice .<ssssss>i agree with another reviewer that it be important to know what you be do if you be go to stay near the u vs. downtown or queen anne .<ssssss>but the hotel have a shuttle service with very accommodate and helpful driver , it be easy to use and readily available , as be they car service which you can reserve for ride to and from the airport .<ssssss>i use they car service for a one day conference in bellevue and be please with how that work out .<ssssss>the hotel also can call cab for you if it be not during shuttle hour , and they come right away and be helpful too .<ssssss>the front desk staff be pretty good , helpful and friendly .<ssssss>every once in a while i ask a question that confuse they , but there be someone else to ask and they do they best to make sure i have correct answer to my question .<ssssss>fitness room be adequate - heck , seattle have so many outdoor fitness option , include bicycle and helmet to borrow at the hotel - so you do not have to settle for the fitness room as the only option .<ssssss>breakfast be adequate as well , more than ample choice and it be decent and available over several hour which be nice .<ssssss>breakfast and happy hour with wine and beer and little snack on the weeknight be include with the room price .<ssssss>there be plenty of other hotel in seattle in higher price range that do not offer nearly as much as this place do .<ssssss>the room be pretty nice , a little on the small side -lrb- at least the studio i have be a little small , but you be not in the room that much -rrb- , but they seem european in feeling , with window that open and very clean and well appoint , lot of nice pillow and modern fixture and bathrobe and decent bath product .<ssssss>the a la carte option be also fun , and a nice free feature .<ssssss>aaa discount offer decent rate .<ssssss>and on the last night , since housekeeping forget to make up my room , the front desk make a special deal for I to make up for that disappointment , which be greatly appreciate .<ssssss>it be a wonderful selling point to have that kind of service which be more than willing to go out of they way when it be they oversight cause a guest disappointment .<ssssss>i do not always find this level of service at hotel that be more expensive , so it go a long way when hotel staff be willing to pay that extra attention to guest comfort and complaint .<ssssss>the watertown certainly have another fan !<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 5 2 2 3		new but tiny we stay here for 3 night split up with a side trip in between .<ssssss>we be newly arrive from america and wonder the street look for the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel be set a few foot off the street with no big signage to guide the way .<ssssss>note to hotel : allow guest to find the hotel be a good idea !<ssssss>you can literally be stand at the shop next to the hotel and not at all tell that the hotel be there!once inside we find a tiny room with 2 tiny single bed .<ssssss>we have be tell by the hotel that no double room be available even though we have book one .<ssssss>it probably be better this way -lrb- we friend stay at the dorsett seaview hotel with a double bed that be not much bigger than a single -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel be very new which be a plus .<ssssss>i have be to other scary old hong kong hotel and it be nice to have a bathroom not cover in mildrew .<ssssss>there be a flat screen tv on the wall with a handful of channel .<ssssss>no closet just one shelf .<ssssss>needless to say we have to close we suitcase just to walk to the bathroom , either that or step through the suitcase .<ssssss>in order to pass each other in the hallway someone have to move to sit on the bed .<ssssss>the location be ok .<ssssss>the good thing be that it be on a quieter street so we do get some sleep .<ssssss>there be restaurant and a 711 plus mcdonald nearby -lrb- for those that have jetlag and need to leave they roomy to sleep -rrb- .<ssssss>the bad thing be that it be a little bit of a hike to nathan road .<ssssss>we do not mind so much since argyle st be a market street and we be able to get all sort of yummy food and drink there -lrb- sugar cane juice be awesome ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>it could have be a bit closer to the action though especially at the end of a long day of walking.i would stay there again but only if i could not get a room at the mingle .<ssssss>and i forget to mention that the staff be only barely helpful .<ssssss>do not bother ask for recommendation or any question about the local area .<ssssss>they be absolutely no help .<ssssss>when we be leave the hotel we be stand outside we room adjust we bag .<ssssss>the maid ask if we be check out and then go into the room to look for the tip then leave .<ssssss>this be right in front of us!we only stay there on the return from we sidetrip since no other hotel room be available for booking -lrb- hong kong be sell out -rrb- .<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		ocena bavaro my girlfriend i stay at this resort form june 1st to june 4th .<ssssss>here be a honest review from someone who have travel extensively .<ssssss>we be upgrade to bloque 5 -lrb- ocean view -rrb- with no additional fee .<ssssss>we arrive at 11:00 a.m. but could not check in until 3 p.m. , no problem , we go to lunch .<ssssss>the food quality and service at the buffet be horrible .<ssssss>the food be edible , but very different .<ssssss>pureed pumpkin for breakfast ?????<ssssss>the mimosa and bloody mary station be nice , and the coffee be great .<ssssss>we feel like 2nd class citizen when we try to get a cup of coffee or a ashtray .<ssssss>we tip like crazy , and speak spanish , but no matter what we do , we be ignore .<ssssss>the beach bartender be great , however .<ssssss>maria at the gift shop -lrb- cigar lady -rrb- be very friendly and a great help .<ssssss>the brazilian resturant be a joke .<ssssss>please do not waste a reservation to eat there , the service be just as bad as the food .<ssssss>the italian be good , but service be lack as well .<ssssss>the room quality be fine , but there be no alarm clock , so use you phone or bring one .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful , very deep with nice white sand .<ssssss>the grounds be beautiful but it do take a while to walk around , and i prefer a much smaller resort .<ssssss>cigarette be $ 2.00 a pack as my friend be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>we meet some really nice people , and the beach staff do work hard to keep thing go .<ssssss>it be a good time , but not a place i would recommend .<ssssss>i have hear all of the dominican resort lack in food quality , which be fine so i do not gain any weight !<ssssss>for the money , we have a good time , but i stand firm that this resort prefer european to american , which be a shame .<ssssss>try it once if you get a good deal .<ssssss>you may feel differently .<ssssss>
2 3 5 -1 5 -1 1 -1		high promise - poor execution this hotel have more promise but fail on execution more than any iâ€™ve ever experience .<ssssss>it be highly regrettable that this most excellent property be run by such a bunch of uncaring and unhelpful people .<ssssss>indeed , ask they the simplest question seem to create a burden on they that only stop sort of outward sigh and hostility .<ssssss>more on that in a moment .<ssssss>first , the good thing : the hotel be a former convent that be in remarkable shape with cross carve in the ceiling beam along with all antique furnishings .<ssssss>when we first arrive , i couldnâ€™t help but softly begin a gregorian chant just to hear it echo in the high ceiling of the entry .<ssssss>similarly , the room have wonderful oriental rug set on top of inlaid wood floor .<ssssss>truly beautiful .<ssssss>unfortunately , the physical plant be where the beauty end .<ssssss>the fellow who work the desk remind one of movie character out of a grade c horror flick who might have take over a convent in order to work on frankenstein-style experiment in the basement while have to put up with boarder to support themselves .<ssssss>even the smallest and tiniest of request create a burden for they and they be quite excellent at make you feel a burden.for example , the hotel advertise â€œwi-fiâ€ ?<ssssss>internet access in every room .<ssssss>after settle in , i try to connect my laptop but no luck .<ssssss>there be a very modern pc in the room that have mozilla browser available but it demand access code -lrb- profile -rrb- before connect .<ssssss>-lrb- i learn latter that the pc in the room be wireless but you can not hook up you own pc to they network -rrb- .<ssssss>so , i go out to inquire as to how to get on the internet .<ssssss>i be tell , â€?i have no idea about thing like computer and so you must try by just press on key hope that it will connect.â€?i ask if tech support be available via a phone call and be tell that would not be possible.another terrific example be when we go to the desk with the name and address of a florence restaurant that have be highly recommend by friend .<ssssss>after considerable prodding , the desk fellow finally agree to look up the phone number in the phone book .<ssssss>he first attempt fail .<ssssss>i insist he try again , he do so and this time he fail again .<ssssss>he say that since we have the address , forget about call and just go there .<ssssss>so , after a 10-euro cab ride we arrive at the restaurant to find it completely close .<ssssss>he couldnâ€™t have care less that we spend time and money track down a place he could have find by phone with just a little bit of effort .<ssssss>but the lack of help that take the cake be we desperate attempt to find a tour into the uffizi gallery .<ssssss>we have not purchase ticket in advance -lrb- sell out -rrb- and be loathe to wait 3 hour in the â€œno reservationâ€?ticket line .<ssssss>we learn that tour group be a definite possibility because include with most tour be a â€œno waitâ€?ticket into the museum .<ssssss>we inquire about such tour at the desk and the fellow tell we he know nothing about they .<ssssss>he say he didnâ€™t know where to locate any and that he best recommendation be to spend the 3 hour in line .<ssssss>late into the evening , i find a tour company on the internet and make arrangement for a tour for the follow day .<ssssss>the tour operator ask where we be stay and when i reply the morandi alla crochette , the operator say we could find the tour company 's brochure in the lobby .<ssssss>later , i ask the same fellow at the desk for the brochure and he produce tour brochure for 3 different operator !<ssssss>he have bald-faced lie to I in my original request for help !<ssssss>he just didnâ€™t want to be bother !<ssssss>one final well-deserved criticism of these guy .<ssssss>i mention earlier how physically beautiful the property be â€?well these fellow be even try to mess that up .<ssssss>the bathroom have ceramic tile that be consistent with the rest of the property .<ssssss>but , these guy hang cheap-looking plastic towel bar and shelve that look like it belong in motel 6 .<ssssss>so , bottom line be that unless they completely overhaul the help -lrb- god forbid that maybe these guy be the owner ! -rrb-<ssssss>, i must recommend vigorously against this place .<ssssss>too bad , too , because without the much affected front desk help , this would be a dynamite hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 5 4 2		beach + staff = excellent/food + drink terrible we just return yesterday from a 6 day stay at the riu bambu .<ssssss>trip date be 1-10-07 thru 1-16-07 .<ssssss>i read as many review of this hotel as i could find before we leave for this vacation and decide that i would take the review as be probably not as good as the best and not as bad as the worst that i have read .<ssssss>there be twelve in my party range in age from 25-60 .<ssssss>i be 42 and my wife be 48 .<ssssss>let start with something i think everyone could agree on .<ssssss>the beach be the best i have ever see in my 25 year of travel .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly .<ssssss>the front desk worker know many langauge and communicate with they be not a problem .<ssssss>very helpful.one call and a delivery to restock you towel or fridge be do within 10 minutes.top notch.those be the only two good part of we stay.since i have read many review on this property i pack one whole duffle bag with nothing but snack , insulate mug , cooler , flashlight , and other essential .<ssssss>good thing i do .<ssssss>do not eat anywhere on the property other than the buffet .<ssssss>only two people in we party do not get ill and that be the two who do not go to the steakhouse , caribe grill , and italian restaurant .<ssssss>while we do not get seriously sick , 1 or 2 day of diarrhea sure put a damper on a 6 day trip .<ssssss>not to mention when you go to one of these place it take a hour and a half to eat .<ssssss>staff be great , food terrible .<ssssss>buffet - egg , bacon -lrb- if cook well that day -rrb- , and pork be only good tasting item other than french fries .<ssssss>i be not a health nut and will eat most anything and none of we have a good meal twice.drinks-if you a beer drinker you s-o-l .<ssssss>the dominican have three different kind of beer , el presedente , bohemia especial , and quisqueya .<ssssss>quisqueya be the only one that taste terrible and that the only one th riu property carry .<ssssss>all in we party be beer drinker with various taste in beer and be very dissapointed .<ssssss>i decide that since i spend almost 2 g 's for my wife and i to go i would not hesitate to spend $ 60 a case in the gift shop for bud , bud light and corrona .<ssssss>get costly but i do not care.bad move on my part to walk around drink out of the bottle.after numerous people find out where i get they they sell out quickly as each gift shop in the riu family only stock about a twelve pack of each .<ssssss>room - very basic 2 star in u.s.a. grounds be well kept.bottom line for we be we could not wait to get back to the state and all eat at mcdonald as we wait for out connect flight in atlanta .<ssssss>i go with the mindset that even if the food be so-so i just want to lay on the beach and drink a few beer for 5 or 6 day .<ssssss>for these people who say the food be excellent and the room be 5 star i would like to sell you some swamp land in florida .<ssssss>unless i eat only fruit or come from a third world country would i say the food be great .<ssssss>i have doubt and do not believe many of the review i read such as this but you will find i be tell the truth .<ssssss>so here be some tip to help you out when you realize what i do .<ssssss># 1 when you want to get a good beer or even a case take a taxi to the mall where hard rock cafe be located and get a good meal while you down there .<ssssss>only cost about $ 10 for the taxi and they have good food and all different brand of beer .<ssssss>not cheap beer or food but good .<ssssss>save the book they hand you about punta cana as you walk into the airport upon arrival .<ssssss>read it and use it to point out to the taxi driver where you want to go .<ssssss># 2 bring a soft cooler and insulate mug to bring you beverage down to the beach .<ssssss>no service down there and long walk to keep fill up 10 o.z. glass they give you at bar .<ssssss># 3 if you be a soda drinker do not expect the 7 up and pepsi they give you in the room for free to taste like back home because they do not .<ssssss>buy some coke or gatorade when you make you beer run .<ssssss>and i like pepsi not coke .<ssssss># 4 go to costco and pick up a 30 pack of snack and pack they away .<ssssss>even if you go off site the price for these item be ridiculous .<ssssss># 5 if you like to read then bring enough material for the whole trip as you can not find a u.s. newspaper anywhere in the riu .<ssssss>they have some popular u.s. magazine with date from a month ago on them.finally and probably the most important tip i would give be to not book at this resort complex .<ssssss>maybe in a few year when they get the food and drink issue resolve .<ssssss>i have find , maybe contrary to other that all inclusive be not the way to go in the dominican .<ssssss>food not good/drinks be water down very badly/and beer and liquer serve be very low quality which be probably why we do not see many drunk people .<ssssss>talk to many other people who where stay at non-all inclusive resort and they indicate you could get any beverage you want and food be very good.if you have any other question feel free to e-mail I and i will give a honest answer as i do not want anyone to go through what we do if they can avoid it .<ssssss>by the time we figure everything out it be time to go home.sincerely , chrisharrison township , michigan u.s.a.burden1@wowway.com<ssssss>

.<ssssss>also , brush up on spanish or take a couple of class .<ssssss>i plan too !<ssssss>most everyone speak spanish and itâ€™s most difficult to communicate .<ssssss>they do have some staff that speak english and some just speak it a little .<ssssss>i be get tired of say â€?no comprehendeâ€ ?<ssssss>my sister be a great help because she new some of what they be say .<ssssss>itâ€™s a good

2 2 4 -1 4 1 3 1		great hotel but not so good welcome ... we stay 4 day .<ssssss>the hotel be confortable and nice .<ssssss>the big deception be about people at the desk .<ssssss>they should take more care of the customer .<ssssss>we just have a hello yes no this be you room number that be all .<ssssss>the last day we have to check out at noon but we be leave at 2pm .<ssssss>we have to carry down we luggage because the people in charge be out for lunch and nobody help we even to keep the door open to put we luggage out !<ssssss>i ask for a cab and just have a grab one outside !<ssssss>answer , that be all .<ssssss>not even a goodbye have a nice trip back we be really disapoint with the unwelcoming people at the front desk !<ssssss>the housekeeping people be very kind fortunately .<ssssss>the smell of chlore be too important in entrance because of the pool .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		noisy , but cute we stay here one night and then head somewhere more quiet after get up in the middle of the night to put earplug in so that we could sleep .<ssssss>the hotel be cute and charming and the owner be nice and welcome .<ssssss>the room be spacious and clean , although they could use some update .<ssssss>there be no air conditioning in we room so we have to leave the window open and the vespa and chatter noise from the street below be intolerable .<ssssss>nice and spacious patio , but do not expect to be able to use it for you private use .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 -1 1 1 -1		warn they overbook !<ssssss>after travel 8 hour to arrive in nyc .<ssssss>i bring in my orbitz confirmation for a reservation .<ssssss>the cold response at the front desk be sorry we just book we last room .<ssssss>they tell I i could pay for a cab togo to they sister hotel and that hotel would would be happy to offer I a room for $ 60.00 more.the manager be so indifferent that i think i be on candid camera .<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		smaller room , but great view and excellent service the room be fairly small and plain , lack the wow factor we have experience at some other four season property .<ssssss>-lrb- but it be also the least expensive four season we have stay at -rrb- .<ssssss>the view be fantastic -- the opera house , circular quay , harbour bridge , and rock district .<ssssss>we room package include a buffet breakfast each morning , and it be wonderful .<ssssss>highly recommended.the gym be small but adequate and be never crowd when we be there .<ssssss>the pool area up on the roof be pretty.the service be excellent -- unfailingly prompt and helpful .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 3 3 4 3		be this really a westin ?<ssssss>we arrive tired and a little edgy after fly in from hong kong , via la .<ssssss>i be confident we would be look after ; my starwood gold card would look after we , right ?<ssssss>wrong !<ssssss>we be give what be without doubt the worst hotel room i have ever stay in , in a developed country .<ssssss>the room be on the 9th floor , which , as it turn out , be also a convention and meeting area , where the few room be cluster together at one end .<ssssss>the room smell musty , the plumbing be extremely noisy , and the fit out of the room remind I of the 1970 .<ssssss>the piece de resistance , though , be the view ... of a plant room some 10 foot from the window !<ssssss>the promise city view have not materialise , though if i stand on the bed and look up i could just see the sky .<ssssss>we ask for another room , but be tell there be not one .<ssssss>in the morning , we be wake by the rattle of trolley , provision the conference and meeting area for the day .<ssssss>in short , a disaster , and one which cause I to wonder what standard be apply by starwood to ensure its property under the westin brand be uniformly good .<ssssss>i have stay at first class westin in shanghai , auckland , melbourne , and sydney ; they bear no resemblance , other than the name , to this place .<ssssss>thankfully there be a first rate steakhouse on site , and the door staff be most helpful ... without that i would have demand my money back ... and i be not pay !<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 2 3 3 -1		absolutely horrible i stay two night at the beginning of my trip to amsterdam .<ssssss>it be such a terrible place that i cancel my last night 's stay and book myself at the ibis for approximately the same price.reasons why i do not like the botel :1 -rrb- the room smell like stale smoke , though i think i request a non-smoking room .2 -rrb- my room be right under the bar , so it be noisy until late .3 -rrb- the bathroom be ridiculously small - i be a small person and hardly fit into the shower4 -rrb- the reservation website say that breakfast be include , but they want a extra 10 euro per day .5 -rrb- the room be not very clean , though the towel be -lrb- i think . -rrb-<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 4 4		best honeymoon ever !<ssssss>.<ssssss>view from we room<ssssss>
4 3 4 4 4 5 2 3		would stay there again , however ... we be always look for good , reasonably-priced hotel in the general area of time square .<ssssss>we spot the belvedere in one of we visit , so we stay there on this trip .<ssssss>the location be good - 2 block from time square .<ssssss>unlike many comparably-priced hotel we have stay at in the area , we room be quite large and very up-to-date ; the bathroom be small , but seem to be recently renovate .<ssssss>there be even a mini kitchenette area with refrigerator and coffee maker .<ssssss>the front desk folk be extremely nice .<ssssss>we be also concern about have to wait a long time for elevator , as we have see this mention in other review - but there be 4 elevator and we have no problem in this area .<ssssss>so we generally love the accommodation -- with 2 exception : # 1 - the most significant be that the room smell of smoke ; it be suppose to be a non-smoking room and be so designate outside the door ; but the room not only smell of smoke , there be also a ashtray in the room !<ssssss>since the bedding also smell of smoke we ask for a change of linen ; the new bedding be deliver to the room , but then the maid make up the bed without use the new linen .<ssssss>have we be stay more than 2 night we probably would have request a different room .<ssssss># 2 - this item be less significant , but be a safety issue .<ssssss>the floor of the hallway enter the room , in front of the bathroom , and in the bathroom be nicely tile , but the tile be extremely slippery - it have be polish so well .<ssssss>we have to put object on the floor in this area to remind ourselves to step very carefully - and even then slip a couple of time - even with sneaker on.we feel we would try this hotel again , but if we have a similar experience with smoke smell we would then cross it off we list .<ssssss>
4 -1 3 5 5 3 3 -1		fantastic location totally agree about the room be very small .<ssssss>i be surprise to see such a tiny double bed .<ssssss>however , we be so tired with all the travel and walk we sleep very well .<ssssss>although there be no noise from other room , there be some distubance during the night from what i think be refuse collector - we have a room at the back of the hotel .<ssssss>have say that , we be in the centre of boston and it could have be a lot worse .<ssssss>the bar be very lively and popular with young people .<ssssss>self service breakfast be fine - well stock and not too busy.the hotel be directly opposite the boston public library and this be truly a hidden gem .<ssssss>do not miss a opportunity to go in - it be absolutely stunning !<ssssss>finally , you can can walk just about everywhere from here or catch the t which be a few metre away .<ssssss>super location at a good value price .<ssssss>boston be a fabulous city - we love it !<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 3 1 4 4		try hard stay at qbic in september .<ssssss>location be hard to find base on the direction give on the websitekiosk check-in be a bit dodgy , they have to do my check-in manually -lrb- and the person before I -rrb- as it didnt seem to want to deliver the cardthe concept be interesting and amazing to think that you can build ahotel pretty much anywhere , but the finish be quite poor , electric socket in my room be already start to pull away from the wall - i would be very interested to see how the room look like after 1 year .<ssssss>but - the hÃ¤stens bed be just amazing and i have a really good night sleep , which be after all the main thing you be look forwould stay again , but only if the price be low<ssssss>

2 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		the hotel definitely have some problem but ... i stay at the grand hotel baglionus for three night .<ssssss>upon arrival , we be somewhat warmly greet by a woman at the front desk .<ssssss>-lrb- i say ` somewhat warmly ' because in florence , if they even speak to you or look at you directly i consider that to be ` warm ' . -rrb-<ssssss>as it be a saturday night , my friend and i ask if there be anywhere in the area to go to -lrb- such as a bar/pub or not too crazy nightclub - i be not the typical tourist want to go crazy in italy -rrb- and the woman say she would tell we when we come back downstairs .<ssssss>when we get to we room , everything seem fine , it be a decent size with a good size bathroom .<ssssss>then we go back downstairs to ask about where to go .<ssssss>the front desk trainee -lrb- alessandro -rrb- insist on help we and be extremely unhelpful .<ssssss>not only could he not tell I where the accademia be on a map -lrb- marked one spot , say no , that be wrong and then proceed to mark another spot and tell I then that he be unsure -rrb- , but he be rude when we insist on speak to the other woman who work at the front desk -lrb- who probably know a lot more than he do ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>he say that he be the only one who could help -lrb- although she be on the other end of the desk -rrb- .<ssssss>that be we first night .<ssssss>there be two main problem with the hotel - first , the staff can be rude and unhelpful -lrb- some be kind and helpful , but do not expect they will be -rrb- and most of the time the information desk be not helpful at all when we ask about major site , such as the uffizi -lrb- as in where it be in relation to the hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>this be the information desk !<ssssss>the second main problem we have be with they card key system .<ssssss>the door be old and have be rework to incorporate the modern card key system and unfortunately it do not work well !<ssssss>the bellman warn we about this and boy be he right !<ssssss>we have to literally almost break down we door every time we want to get into we room .<ssssss>other than that , the hotel have two major thing go for it - it be literally across the street from the train station and have a fantastic breakfast spread in a beautiful breakfast room .<ssssss>despite the problem with my stay , those two positive might be enough for I to go back to this hotel .<ssssss>if you do stay there , please be aware that the service be not so good -lrb- they be responsive if you call housekeeping or the front desk but not friendly and not especially helpful if they do not want to be -rrb- so be prepare for that florentine attitude and you will be fine .<ssssss>tip : hotel do not let you use they restroom - although i ask very politey i encounter the rudest hotel staff i have ever encounter in my life !<ssssss>this hotel be no different - when i be in the lobby at the baglioni i overheard the person at the front desk proclaim , this be not a public restroom !<ssssss>
5 4 5 2 5 5 5 3		a fine hotel we begin we elbe river cruise with 3 day at the concorde in berlin .<ssssss>there be no disappointment .<ssssss>the hotel be worthy of 4 to 5 star .<ssssss>it be location be not the most convenient for the tourist sight but be very close to the underground station .<ssssss>then room be clean and well appoint the staff be polite and well train .<ssssss>the breakfast be awesome .<ssssss>what more can we say ?<ssssss>a bit pricey , but so be all of berlin .<ssssss>we would probably not stay again but only because of the location .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 2 3 4 -1		price go up and quality go down .<ssssss>we have stay at the villa del mar hau 3 or 4 year in a row , but have not be back to pr for 3 year .<ssssss>we be in for a shock.the first room they give we for $ 124 have indoor/outdoor carpeting that be filthy , window ditto , the whole room smell moldy , or ?<ssssss>speak with another couple who have have a similar experience.we refuse that room and get another with same window condition -lrb- look like they have not be wash in the 3 year we be not there -rrb- .<ssssss>the drapery have not be open in age and be very dirty .<ssssss>but it do have a balcony view of beach , and a stove frig.we leave to visit rincon for 2 night and call the del mar hau to try to get out of the rest of we reservation , but they refuse .<ssssss>the manager ask what be wrong , so i tell he about the rug , window , drapery filth .<ssssss>and , they finally give a room like we be use to , which now go for $ 150 .<ssssss>in other word they try ... i think they wash the window and the curtain do not smell that bad ; tile floor , much easier to keep clean .<ssssss>french door open out to beach , nice , yes , that be why we come back 4 time .<ssssss>the beach have good snorkling and swimming .<ssssss>lot of surfer stay in the cottage and split the high cost .<ssssss>so , the owners/managers be rely on they incredibly wonderful location and beach to charge they high fee .<ssssss>while , quality suffers.we be there 4 year ago when they buy and be place the new bed .<ssssss>we see they do it .<ssssss>however , the bed do get pretty worn and uncomfortable in 5 year of frequent use .<ssssss>also , they do not use mattress pad which help hold the sheet on and can be wash , , , , , so you hope that the sheet fit well enough so you do not end up sleep directly on the mattress like i do the first night , , , , not nice .<ssssss>and the restaurant ... .<ssssss>whoa , gemme a break .<ssssss>it be common knowledge that the restaurant be no good .<ssssss>eh food , and really bad service , as witness by very few people eat there .<ssssss>one example : fresh prican bread be baked fresh and deliver everyday , almost everywhere -lrb- even the funky local cigar store/mini market -rrb- .<ssssss>we try the restaurant once more ... .<ssssss>ask for some bread butter to tide we over and receive lousy whole wheat sandwich bread slice in half with some weird roasted unfresh roasted garlic .<ssssss>eck , we almost go back to we room to get we fresh bread.all in all , it be really a shame .<ssssss>we be realize that it be better to stay inland for more reasonable price and just go visit this beach , playa montones , and other beach .<ssssss>probably the same elsewhere too .<ssssss>see we positive review of do angele in rincon .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 4 5 5 2		elegant , accommodate and comfortable i return a week ago from new orlean , louisiana , and stay at the hilton riverside .<ssssss>the hotel be magnificent and i have to tell you the accommodation , service , and ambience be very good .<ssssss>i be a hilton honor member so i choose this hotel on this fact .<ssssss>while arrange my travel , i book my arrival a couple day before a large convention come in so i could ask for a better room if it be not to my expectation .<ssssss>i also ask for a remodeled room face the river with a king bed since i be travel alone .<ssssss>a day before i fly out , i confirm my room and again ask for a newer room with the same booking - and it be as i order .<ssssss>upon arrival i find it be lovely and comfortable , so much that it be hard to get away from the hotel to go to many of my tour and activity .<ssssss>hilton honor stock my favorite spa and fragrance brand which be crabtree and evelyn , which also add to my positive experience .<ssssss>in fact , many evening i just stay in a rest with the several stuff pillow and comforter on the bed , have be to some of the popular night place .<ssssss>the room be always clean well every day -lrb- with exception of dust on light fixture in the bathroom and the desk area -rrb- .<ssssss>i do lay out $ 5 per day to the maid service because i think the maid service do a better job change out many thing like product , clean towel and the service be very nice .<ssssss>i be disappoint when i do not receive a new morning menu , new stationary or any small touch little things.a few pitfall with the riverside :1 -rrb- air system be too enclosed and not enough outside air exchange .<ssssss>there be no opening in this hotel , no window , no air from the outside .<ssssss>i be always stuff up however , due to the central air system ; the filter system be not keep up so the room be always stuffy .<ssssss>2 -rrb- everything , everything , cost at this hotel and even though you be a hilton honor member food cost , no continental breakfast , no mint on bed .<ssssss>the foodservice be extremely expensive ; and housekeeping do not offer any more order tag for breakfast so i do not order from the restaurant any more than my first morning .<ssssss>there be not a fridge to store any cold item as the stock food fridge -lrb- double price -rrb- will not store guest item .<ssssss>a fridge cost extra .<ssssss>movie of course cost on a pay per view basis .<ssssss>vend cost $ 2.50 each down by the ice machine .<ssssss>the internet wireless connection cost even if you be a hilton honor member at the rate of $ 5.95 per hour or $ 14.95 for 24 continual hour -lrb- you can not stop and start -rrb- so i do not use it only for a hour .<ssssss>the hilton riverside do not have a exit survey which i be a little skeptical as to why ?<ssssss>the short survey upon checkout use the tv remote be out of service .<ssssss>the honor program do not allow for full health club access but i walk around the city too much to worry about this small detail.the two pool be lovely , especially the one face the river .<ssssss>i see that it be not use as much as expect .<ssssss>the health center 's pool be very busy !<ssssss>the health center be way in the far distance of the hilton complex and i do take time to tour it and enjoy a short walking workout .<ssssss>the bell boy be very sloooow , and never come to retrieve my luggage when call before checkout .<ssssss>there be not enough personnel at the concierge desk so if a guest be to call downstairs instead of wait in line for a question or tour assistance , they would pick up the phone and hang it up -lrb- i.e. you would get a dead line -rrb- .<ssssss>when you do reach they the woman be sincerely helpful , but the older gentleman be rather too cantankerous for my taste .<ssssss>restaurant be great , and they even accommodate to go order for hotel guest .<ssssss>what i really love about the hilton riverside be its location in the new orlean tourist section of the city .<ssssss>the hilton be connect to a lower level mall call the ` riverwalk .<ssssss>you enter 1 and 2 story down to what actually be river level or ground floor , into a half a mile or so of over 130 store !<ssssss>the mall also connect to the convention center so if i need to walk that direction i could do so in air conditioning !<ssssss>the hilton be next to the aquarium , imax theatre , and harrahâ€™s .<ssssss>even though i have a harrahâ€™s promotion package i only game once due to harrah 's internal air - too smoky for I .<ssssss>all thing asside , i think the hotel and room be of excellent value while in new orlean .<ssssss>
2 2 5 4 5 1 1 4		not for people under 25 it be a beautiful hotel with a beautiful view ... but , if you be under 25 you can not use the gym , the hot spring , or even the pool .<ssssss>sadly , they do not advertise this on they website .<ssssss>the sole reason i pick this hotel over the other offer be all the extra it have to offer .<ssssss>unfortunately , my son that be travel with I be only 20 and could not use any of they .<ssssss>it be very disappointing to say the least.the room be beautiful and clean .<ssssss>the tub be heaven , especially after a long day of sightseeing ... -lrb- although the hot spring probably would have be nicer . -rrb-<ssssss>the staff be very stuffy and we have several problem find someone that understand english well .<ssssss>i think they cater mostly to businessman and conference and really do not care about regular tourists.the other hotel i have stay at in tokyo in march be much more tourist friendly .<ssssss>
1 1 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		barcelona -lrb- fawlty tower -rrb- princess at first sight the design of the hotel be very modern and cool , but the service be at the very least confused .<ssssss>we have a conference here the food be generally poor , one dinner we have for 25 people the food be cold .<ssssss>the air conditioning in we room take 3 day and four attempt to fix and then the maid lock my wife out on the balcony for half a hour .<ssssss>the manager send we a bottle of cava by way of apology but never phone to apologise.asking reception for a taxi be like ask they to sell they family into slavery!in the main foyer beautiful glass window and table be break and remain unmended over 6 day .<ssssss>what a shame , the hotel could be superb if the service be improve and reorganised.shame<ssssss>
1 3 1 3 1 3 3 -1		3 star roach motel be more like it we book the holiday inn ssf through priceline and since we be unfamiliar with the hotel , we be hope it would live up to priceline 's standard .<ssssss>most time we have stay in 4 star hotel but since this be the new year 's weekend , it be not possible to get a 4 star within we price range .<ssssss>overall the lobby and room seem to be renovate somewhat and upon enter we room , it appear to be clean and comfortable .<ssssss>we spend one night in what we think be relative comfort until the next morning .<ssssss>i go to take a shower in the early morning .<ssssss>my 8 year old daughter enter the bathroom to brush she tooth .<ssssss>i be still in the shower when i hear she scream , mommy , there be a roach on the wall !<ssssss>i hurry up and finish my shower and yell to my husband to try to kill it .<ssssss>by the time he get up , the insect in question have already flee up to the light fixture .<ssssss>i reassure my daughter that it may have be a beetle or something else , surely not a roach even though she insist that she have watch enough national geographic channel to know the difference between a beetle and a roach .<ssssss>anyway , since neither my husband nor i have see the insect in question , we go about we usual routine .<ssssss>i get dress and as i be about to plug in my hair straightener , there it be , clear as day ... a roach in the outlet !<ssssss>needless to say we be disgusted and quickly pack up we thing and promptly go to the front desk to complain .<ssssss>we take several picture from we digital camera for evidence , and i would post they if it be not for the gross factor .<ssssss>since we go through priceline , we have to contact they regard we experience and luckily , holiday inn be very cooperative and agree to a full refund .<ssssss>it be a hassle , but the staff be very apologetic .<ssssss>unfortunately , it do nothing to quell my daughter 's paranoia about roach be in we thing .<ssssss>when we inform the front desk , they immediately send custodial staff to investigate but do nothing to ask we where we have see the roach .<ssssss>we all know how prolific roach can be and there clearly must be a problem in more than this one room .<ssssss>while the hotel seem fairly clean , this be a warning , book you room somewhere that you be comfortable with .<ssssss>i know i will never settle for anything less than a 4 or 5 star hotel .<ssssss>we rebook at a neighbor 4 star hotel and have a great weekend , despite we adventure with holiday inn .<ssssss>
2 2 4 2 4 3 1 -1		mixed feeling the hotel be modern and clean .<ssssss>the reception staff be pleasant but ineffective .<ssssss>we be a little disappointed to find the hotel be further out of the centre than we would expect but this be not a great problem as we use the tourist bus which stop just round the corner from the hotel .<ssssss>the room be good and the bed really comfortable .<ssssss>unfortunately the floor be not carpet and noise due to foot fall level be high late at night and early in the morning .<ssssss>we do appreciate the bottled water which be available as you come out of the lift .<ssssss>we stay at the hotel for 4 day and on two occasion we room have not be service by 16.30 ... when i ring reception they tell I they would be busy and do i want the matter report to the manager .<ssssss>i say i would and i be still wait for he response ... we be tell that the bar and catering have be franchise out - perhaps this explain the fact that although the bar be advertise as be open until 1pm it be near impossible to get a nightcap after 11.30 ... there be also a problem with breakfast - they do not always replace item that have run out ie butter , orange juice , coffee etc. i would not recommend this hotel , but can not wait to go back to barcolona .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 3 3 2		a bit date the only benefit of this hotel be the location , just a pedestrian bridge away from the airport .<ssssss>a great thing when you be fly over 20 hour from india to get there .<ssssss>the room be ok , clean sheet , clean carpet , etc. but no tea / coffee make facility in the room .<ssssss>what be that about ?<ssssss>there be a nice big tub in the bathroom , and some nice bath gel , but no stopper in the tub , so how do u fill it up ?<ssssss>tv channel be ok , but the retract door of the tv cabinet do not retract enough , and i keep bang into they , scrape quite a bit of skin off my shoulder .<ssssss>ouch !<ssssss>laundry be good , but the claim same day service be only accurate if you live 48 hour days.room service be efficient .<ssssss>i order a burger at 2 be one night .<ssssss>it arrive in 15 minute , fresh , hot , and juicy.coffee shop food be ok .<ssssss>breakfast spread be adequate .<ssssss>the nearby angus restaurant , however , be a must try .<ssssss>excellent food , nice ambience , and some very beautiful waitress to boot !<ssssss>
3 2 5 4 3 4 5 4		not the perfect party spot but its sure nice ... beautiful spot around the resort<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 5 3 3 3		great location - very noisy !!<ssssss>the locationof this hote l be fantastic - just off las rambles .<ssssss>room be small and noisy - we request a room on the higher floor but could still hear all the traffic and siren from the road below .<ssssss>get very little sleep here .<ssssss>also - the swimming pool be more like a oversized bath - a joke really .<ssssss>other than that though the hotel be ok - decor be good and the rooftop bar be lovely .<ssssss>location be the main thing here though .<ssssss>
