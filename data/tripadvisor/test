2 1 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		a towering absurdity first , the nearly impenetrable crowd of time square tourist make entrance to this hotel a exhausting challenge .<ssssss>-lrb- if you be always hope to see time square , you should know that it have become little more than a gigantic outdoor mall - a sunglass hut here , gap across the street , olive garden down on the corner -rrb- .<ssssss>but you have get the energy and the nerve -lrb- hey , this be ny ! -rrb-<ssssss>, and you have make it inside !<ssssss>you wait with a dozen other guest -lrb- now 15 , now 21 -rrb- for the elevator to you room , or to the check-in desk which be on the eighth floor .<ssssss>the wait be as much as 15 minute , since the computer system that control the elevator tend to crash when it get busy .<ssssss>and it be always busy here - there be three conference go on simultaneously when we be here , and that be less than usual .<ssssss>you be grateful when john show up in he red double-breasted jacket to excort the now highly impatient crowd to the freight elevator - past the stack chair and dusty case of hotel water bottle .<ssssss>john 's nice enough -lrb- everyone 's nice enough here -rrb- , and he say simply that this be what happen here when it be busy .<ssssss>that be what the waitress say when she try to deliver we breakfast 35 minute late .<ssssss>but do not worry , they will comp it when it be late .<ssssss>they be use to it .<ssssss>thing here be always late .<ssssss>now you be ready to check out .<ssssss>you stand on the 33rd or 41st floor for 10 minute , 15 minute , as the crowd grow , bag in tow , wait for a elevator to stop at you floor .<ssssss>slowly the awkward banter go silent , the humor be go , and someone go to call from the nearby emergency phone .<ssssss>they will send someone soon .<ssssss>they be very nice - they be use to it here .<ssssss>the crowd grow .<ssssss>on a floor above , the alarm ring .<ssssss>uh oh .<ssssss>someone 's have a worse time than you .<ssssss>but at last a elevator stop at the floor , ten of the more ambitious of you squeeze on -lrb- hope that alarm do not have to ring -rrb- , and soon you be downstairs , thankful to have make it out alive .<ssssss>wait on the 50 person line for a cab ?<ssssss>no thanks , we will just walk up to eighth ave and hail one ourselves .<ssssss>but the room be nice .<ssssss>good luck .<ssssss>
2 3 4 5 3 1 5 4		hmm .<ssssss>.<ssssss>where to start ??<ssssss>brother get mug on resort ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>.<ssssss>-lsb- -- -rsb- front desk ??<ssssss>... well let 's just start off by say that the resort be beautiful and we have a prime spot close to the buffet , pool and beach .<ssssss>but it be too bad that they food be garbage , and although we have access to all 5 a la carte the portion be very very small and everything taste like garbage.i must say that the best thing about the resort be the activity staff !!<ssssss>... always smile and have a great time around the pool and on the beach !!!<ssssss>and i must say that that be the best lobby party i have ever be to before .<ssssss>thank you activity staff , , you guy be awesome!although we have a amazing time with the activity staff and bar staff , we have a horrible experience when we be on the resort ... my brother end up get mug outside of the disco and the man hold a huge machette knife to my brother throught ... my brother think that that be the end of he life then and there .<ssssss>but thank god he could run as fast as he do .<ssssss>so the man get all of my brother money , he bank card , which he somehow manage to withdraw over $ 1000 , as well as he silver chain and braclet .<ssssss>we be just disgusted of how something like that could happen on a 4 star resort ... do not make sense to I at all .<ssssss>it be horrible when something like that have to happen on the resort right in the middle of we vacation .<ssssss>to not even feel safe on the resort that we book we 1 week vacation on be the worst feeling to have especially have 3 day leave to spend on that resort.bottom line , the front desk lobby staff and guest service staff be absolutly horrible .<ssssss>they didnt help we out at all .<ssssss>they screw we around more then anything .<ssssss>horrible when you have to go to the front desk for help and no one be capable or willing to help !!<ssssss>disgust ... so due to the mugging incodent and the usless front lobby staff i strongly do not reccommend this resort to anyone .<ssssss>stay away , it be not safe !!!!<ssssss>
1 -1 1 5 1 1 1 -1		this place stink this be suppose to be the crown jewel of berlin hotel .<ssssss>it be not , it stink .<ssssss>staff be totally apathetic , the place stink of cigarette smoke -lrb- and we be in the non-smoking floor -rrb- and the room we be assign be cramped and uncomfortable .<ssssss>after two day we cut we loss -lrb- hotel would not give we a refund on we one week stay book through expedia -rrb- and check into the swisshotel , which btw be absolutely wonderful.don ' t stay at the kempi under any circumstance .<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great potential , unrealized i too arrive at the sofitel with high expectation .<ssssss>the website photo look great and the staff have respond to all of my email request quickly and graciously .<ssssss>travel with friend , we book a superior room at a rate of 185e and a executive suite at a rate of 295e .<ssssss>for a four night stay.i arrive around 10am , please to discover the hotel be honor my request for a early check-in .<ssssss>the process be quick , the staff very friendly .<ssssss>unfortunately , my happiness level decrease when i see my suite .<ssssss>i be locate on the 6th floor overlook dam square .<ssssss>decorate as you see in the web photo with blonde and dark wood , the tiny living area be about 7-8 foot with a small sofa , chair , desk and build in cabinet with a expresso maker , minibar and tv .<ssssss>the promise cd player be miss .<ssssss>there be a small doorway to the bedroom just barely hold a king-sized bed with another small doorway to a bathroom .<ssssss>very small , almost like regular room but cut into two compartment .<ssssss>i call the front desk and comment that the suite seem very different from the one show on the website which contain a table and chair .<ssssss>i be tell that i would be give one of the largest suite .<ssssss>this , i learn later , be not true .<ssssss>the second room be not ready until later in the day .<ssssss>we appreciate that the staff have provide a room right across the hall from the suite , face the back of the hotel .<ssssss>it be a tad dark but otherwise fine with the same blonde/dark wood decor .<ssssss>the bathroom be spacious with a very large bathtub and very clean .<ssssss>it closely resemble the website photo.the hotel be located on dam square across from the royal palace and just a few block from central station , the center of tourist mecca .<ssssss>the grand krasnapolsky be across the square and the hotel amsterdam be next door .<ssssss>the tram stop right in front of the hotel with additional stop for other route very close by .<ssssss>this make the hotel very convenient .<ssssss>you can hop on a tram or you can walk to you destination .<ssssss>we walk everywhere , have a fun dinner and walk back to the hotel with no problems.the suite be claustrophobic to sleep in and the noise of dam square make it impossible to keep the window open .<ssssss>the tram bell prove to be the greatest challenge .<ssssss>a housekeeper show we a junior suite the next morning and , at we request , the hotel allow we to move into it , generously lower we rate to 225e .<ssssss>a vast improvement over the suite .<ssssss>the junior suite be about the same size but without the wall that create the separate living area .<ssssss>the bathroom wall be make of glass , which add to the feel of spaciousness .<ssssss>the junior suite be larger than the superior room and not as dark .<ssssss>bottom line : skip the executive suite and get a junior suite .<ssssss>request the 07 suite .<ssssss>.<ssssss>room 207-507 .<ssssss>they be the best with a tiny set of stair into a room with a beam ceiling .<ssssss>we do not land one of these junior suite but the housekeeper recommend they .<ssssss>they also recommend the suite on the opposite corner of the building .<ssssss>i think they be room 217-517 but i may be off .<ssssss>apparently these be junior suite as well the larger one bedroom suite .<ssssss>they also have a tiny set of stair into the room and come with tiny balcony overlook dam square .<ssssss>if you book with swissotel , email the hotel and request these corner rooms.breakfast come with we rate but we only eat in the hotel a couple of time .<ssssss>the breakfast be good , with a variety of bread , pastry , cereal , cheese , smoked fish , egg , bacon , sausage , coffee and fresh juice .<ssssss>but there be so many other place you can go and if breakfast be not include , you have to pay 20e which be too much in comparison with all of the nearby cafe .<ssssss>i be also a bit outraged that the hotel charge my friend 20e for the ` breakfast ' on the morning of we arrival when all she have be a cup of coffee and roll while she wait for I to put my thing into my suite .<ssssss>other observation : the room have ac but it do not always work very well .<ssssss>you can not leave you window open because of the noise so the room can get a bit stuffy .<ssssss>the decor be very pleasant and contemporary , definitely a step above many of the other hotel in the area , but even recently renovate room have a bit of a ` worn ' feel .<ssssss>the beautiful wood floor of the junior suite be badly stain in one area , truly a shame .<ssssss>the housekeeping staff be top knotch .<ssssss>the room be very clean and the bathroom be spotless .<ssssss>the staff overall be very accommodate although one person leave we cold .<ssssss>the internet access offer from the room be spotty .<ssssss>i could not get it to work and could not get someone from the staff to help I .<ssssss>i have to resort to the business center computer .<ssssss>also , the crowd of tourist during the day wear you down quickly and the street toward central station be a bit seedy at night .<ssssss>i think it be because the hotel be very close to the red light district .<ssssss>the hotel have great potential .<ssssss>you really want to like it with its upscale room decor .<ssssss>.<ssssss>central location .<ssssss>.<ssssss>pleasant staff .<ssssss>.<ssssss>and clean enormous bathroom .<ssssss>hotel often grow on I after i get past the biasness of my expectation .<ssssss>unfortunately , this one do not .<ssssss>i doubt i will stay there again .<ssssss>after walk around amsterdam , i think i will sacrifice the ` great location ' on dam square for the charm of the canal and more ` residential ' area .<ssssss>i be more likely to stay at a place like the ambassade for less money , more charm and a bit of quiet .<ssssss>

4 2 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		solid choice if a tad expensive a work colleague and i be attend a conference at the raus centre on the outskirts of amsterdam .<ssssss>we would have prefer a hotel near the raus but all of these be book up , too expensive or have bad review on this site .<ssssss>therefore we settle on the jolly carlton as it be just off rembrantdplein and on the route of the number 4 tram , which go directly to the raus .<ssssss>the hotel be a few tram stop down from central station with the rai centre about 20 minute further down the line.i book one standard double room each for myself and my colleague on expedia .<ssssss>i arrive on a sunday and do not get a upgrade to a superior room whereas my colleague arrive on a tuesday and , without prompt , do get a upgrade .<ssssss>we both check out on friday morning so perhaps he shorter stay mean he be more likely to get the lucky break.i can not speak for my colleague 's room but my standard double room -lrb- 215 -rrb- be suitable for its purpose .<ssssss>the size of the room be adequate for one person but it may feel a bit cramped for two .<ssssss>there be plenty of cupboard and hang space , the desk be a good size and the separate table and chair be most useful .<ssssss>the desk be too close to the bed for comfort and there be a general lack of power point but i get by by shuffling recharge device .<ssssss>free coffee/tea make facility be included.the bed be very comfortable for a hotel bed and it have decent pillow .<ssssss>the window arrangement be slightly odd , semi-circular in shape with a assortment of drape to pull across and no view to speak of .<ssssss>however there be no significant light spill or noise creep from the fairly busy main road outside and this be a big plus for I .<ssssss>in fact , i do not realise i have the ac turn on for the first two day , which be help to mask the outside noise.the bathroom be very clean and well stock , with a excellent light shave mirror .<ssssss>the shower , over a medium size bath , be very cramped ; anyone over 6 foot would have to stand sideways to avoid bump they shoulder into a protrude wooden cover along the length of the cieling above the bath , which be hide a large pipe i presume .<ssssss>the shower itself be slightly tricky to get the temperature right - and keep it there - but i have have much worse and the pressure be good.the mini-bar be reasonably stock , with a small can of heineken cost 5 euro .<ssssss>i use the laundry service at 10 euro for a pair of jeans and these be competently clean .<ssssss>the wireless internet do not work very well , maybe because the antenna on my room 's device be break .<ssssss>the 100mb lan connection from the same device do work well , even if it be more than 20 euro for one day 's access -lrb- max 24 hour , to 14:00 -rrb- .<ssssss>the television work properly with bbc world , sky news and cnn for the english speaker and a better choice of german , dutch , french and italian channel for others.the description of the hotel on expedia claim that all room have a mini-safe .<ssssss>this be not the case !<ssssss>also , there be nothing even vaguely suitable that i could find to securely attach a kensington lock to .<ssssss>even though the staff at reception be more than happy to put my laptop in the back room when i want to leave it at the hotel , i would have prefer to secure it in my room.the hotel recpetion staff and porter be all very friendly and speak excellent english -lrb- and italian i think -rrb- .<ssssss>i choose not to eat at the hotel since i do not have time for a full breakfast and most other meal be provide at the conference .<ssssss>the menu look expensive but of a high standard.overall , i would say this be a good three star hotel but not a four star hotel .<ssssss>if you be go as a couple , or be over 6 foot tall , i would strongly recommend get one of the superior room but for a single person or a small couple , the standard room be sufficient .<ssssss>i will give it 4/5 however if i have have to pay for the room myself , i would have give 3/5 .<ssssss>

1 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		good location , awful service , and expensive i spend 2 night at holiday inn fisherman 's wharf last week , the last 2 day of a roadtrip that take I to a handful of similar holiday inn properties.our room rate of $ 196.00 midweek be expensive , so i be expect reasonable service and a comfortable room .<ssssss>in reality , the room and the service level be significantly worse than at a $ 60 holiday inn express in other cities.the first -lrb- non-smoking -rrb- room that we be give - as gold-level priority club member - be tatty and stank of smoke , and look out onto a bank of noisy air-conditioning unit .<ssssss>we immediately ask to be move to a cleaner , quieter room , which we be give .<ssssss>there be nothing wrong with the room , but it look a bit worn and tired , and really be nothing special at all.front-desk staff be arrogant , curt , and verge on rude .<ssssss>we use some $ 10 restaurant voucher we have to have breakfast in the hotel , which be a mistake !<ssssss>we be sit at a table and offer coffee , and all of the coffee cup be dirty - they have 1/2 of milky brown water in the bottom , and bit of food stick around the mug as if they would be rinse off in dirty water .<ssssss>the cutlery be the same - my fork have a bit of dry egg inbetween the prongs!anyway , we order we breakfast , wait 25 minute , and eventually 3 of we 4 breakfast arrive .<ssssss>my omlette do not .<ssssss>i could see the waitress standing by the kitchen door chat to another member of staff .<ssssss>i wait and wait , and eventually ask for the manager who come and apologise , and my omlette turn up about 5 minute later , by which time the rest of my family have finish and be ready to leave.breakfast for 4 of we - which be 4 coffee and 4 omlette / egg bacon etc - come to $ 80 , the biggest rip-off and the worst service that i have every experience in any hotel .<ssssss>fortunately , the manager take $ 40 off after i would complain about the service.parking at the hotel be perfectly ok , but at $ 32.00 + tax per day it be not cheap .<ssssss>i notice that there be some public parking lot near the cruise ship terminal for $ 10 a day which would have be a better bet.all in all , the hotel be poor value for money .<ssssss>overprice , complacent , and poorly-trained staff .<ssssss>we total bill for 2 night ' accomodation , tax and parking -lrb- without the breakfast -rrb- come to almost $ 600 .<ssssss>the next night we stay in a holiday inn express near the airport for $ 69.00 which be twice as good .<ssssss>
1 2 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		say no to jw marriot-new orlean i have stay at marriot before and have top-notch service , but this be one of my worst hotel experience ever .<ssssss>i leave a message for the hotel to allow my sister , who would be arrive from san francisco 3 hour before i would be check in , to be able to check-in and get access to my prepaid room .<ssssss>the message be never give .<ssssss>she in turn leave a message at the front desk to let I know she be in the hotel restaurant wait for I .<ssssss>the message be never give .<ssssss>i checked-in and get settle in my room .<ssssss>my sister do not have a cell phone in case you be wonder .<ssssss>i decide to go to the restaurant and eat , but want to leave a message at the front desk for when she arrive .<ssssss>i be tell a paper message would be throw away and give the impression that a message would be ineffective .<ssssss>obviously this jw marriot have inefficiency issue with message .<ssssss>the list go on : a rude and discourteous valet , have to call for housekeeping at 3:30 in the afternoon because the room have not be clean , have to call for toilet paper , short-circuit iron , short-handed bar staff , take 30 minute to get my car out of valet at check-out .<ssssss>new orlean be great , but the stay at this jw make the trip a disappointment .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 5 5 5 4		wonderful except for the noise ... .<ssssss>a lovely hotel , great staff , terrific restaurant , and what a location !<ssssss>but , if you want to sleep on you vacation ... this property be not a good choice .<ssssss>wall be paper-thin between room and you can hear everything go on in the adjoining room -lrb- on either side , and above -rrb- .<ssssss>after report concern to the front desk they say we have to call they as soon as we hear the noise -lrb- which be more or less non-stop -rrb- and they would send security to investigate ... not really something we want to become involved/engaged in during we vacation .<ssssss>people in other room be not be that unreasonable ... the hotel just need to do something about soundproofing .<ssssss>there be also a gaggle of musician make noise for donation directly in front of the international marketplace -lrb- right across the road from this hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>the drum , electric guitar and steel drum solo carry on until after 2:00 am , make it impossible to have a window open .<ssssss>we speak with hotel security staff at the entrance and they say there be not really anything they could do about it .<ssssss>it be obvious that we be not the only one be bother as we witness other voice similar complaint .<ssssss>i would think the surround hotel would be take step with the local authority to establish some guideline .<ssssss>we speak with the police at the waikiki beach detachment and they have receive similar complaint that same day .<ssssss>we live in the heart of downtown vancouver in a condo and be not unreasonable about city noise , but between the poor sound proofing and the unregulated noise maker across the road we do not get one night of sleep in two week !<ssssss>so , if you be hope to get any rest during you stay in waikiki i would personally not recommend this otherwise lovely property .<ssssss>

3 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		be you expectation too high ?<ssssss>i be at the grand paradise at the beginning of march and find the hotel to be just what we expect .<ssssss>a 4 * .<ssssss>if you be go to cuba or dominican you should know that a 4 star here be not a 4 star in canada .<ssssss>we be at sandal in cuba in november and other than the room -lrb- sandal be a suite -rrb- there be not a lot of difference .<ssssss>we find the food basically the same at the resort .<ssssss>i be happy eating omelette and pasta and typically do not eat anything different even if i be on vacation in the we .<ssssss>my husband try everything and we be never sick at all .<ssssss>we have visit many resort and find the staff at this one , the best .<ssssss>the guy make omelette actually be make 4 or 5 at one time , unlike some who only cook one at a time at other place .<ssssss>the bartender at the beach bar be quick , friendly and call out to people in the line so they could be serve quicker .<ssssss>there be pop and lot of water provide in you room fridge and never have any trouble with towel or the room get clean .<ssssss>the room need update and we notice that there be painting in one of the area be start .<ssssss>we initially do not like the location of we room so they move we the next day to a room around the pool .<ssssss>the front desk go out of they way to accomodate .<ssssss>the show here be some of the best .<ssssss>i pay $ 860.00 plus tax so be very satisfied .<ssssss>if you want a low key resort , with a beautiful walking beach , a place to lay you head at night , go here .<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 3 2 1 3		sharp practice it be a shame to see this hotel slide down the trip advisor rating .<ssssss>this be a good hotel that be in a truly excellent location however i guess some of the staff be just upset they clients.i book this hotel directly with the internet , book superior velvet room for my group at they internet rate of euro 115,00 per night .<ssssss>however , upon leave the hotel realise that they have charge I a rate of euro 139,00 per room per night .<ssssss>okay , i should have have my wit about I -lrb- but have a heavy night previously -rrb- but the hotel will not respond to my e-mail nor will anybody in authority return my call .<ssssss>they simply do not seem to care now that i have left.having say that , the room -lrb- at the front -rrb- have a tremendous view of the street , be bright , spacious and clean .<ssssss>the furnishings be funky and modern with lot of nice touch .<ssssss>make sure you get a room overlook the street as the picture window be great -lrb- and maybe better than the suite on the top floof ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>there be room with a more ` traditional ' bathroom than discuss in other review .<ssssss>disabled / superior room will have the traditional bathroom style although it be more of a wetroom than a bathroom.people have rave about the breakfast on this site but to be honest it be rather ordinary .<ssssss>there be much better and far funkier place to eat for better food and better value.similarly , when surround by so many bar , it be pretty pointless staying in the hotel bar which be smart but fairly dull but massively overpriced.the location be excellent for the s-bahn and for the tram and there be a great choice of nightlife in this area.however on oranienburgerstrasse , be aware of the pushy -lrb- but non-aggressive -rrb- drug dealer who try and ply you with coke and hash .<ssssss>i mean , even my 71 year old father be offer some -lrb- and he do not quite look like a user ... -rrb- !<ssssss>also be aware of the very pushy prositute .<ssssss>they all look the same with orange tan , bleached hair , skinny jeans and bum bag .<ssssss>i be sure that they will leave you alone if you be a couple but they really want to ply you with they service .<ssssss>all harmless enough though !<ssssss>berlin be a great place , especially the old east , the hotel be in a great location , just take confirmation of you book with you when pay or the staff at th arcotel velvet will sting you for full rate .<ssssss>very sneaky!i have be to berlin previously and will be back again .<ssssss>so watch out arcotel , i be come back for my cash !<ssssss>grr !<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 2 4 4 -1		ok , a bit old the hotel be a little run down and the bathroom be fairly old.the spa , le spa be not worth go to.very average hotel .<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 3 4 3 3		tired and rough around the edge i be a business traveler and stay at marriott property 150 + night a year , and be very loyal to the chain .<ssssss>thus , i generally know what to expect when i arrive at a hotel .<ssssss>i value consistency across property and a standardized level of service and amenity , and i find marriott generally do this better than other chains.i be disappoint by this property .<ssssss>while it be located right across the street from the beach , and the view from most of the room be beautiful , other aspect of the property leave I disappointed.this be a older hotel -lrb- probably 30 year old -rrb- , not build originally as a marriott , and it get heavy foreign tourist traffic ... all ingredient for disaster even before you set foot on the property .<ssssss>i realize that this be not the typical airport business marriott , and a resort be different , but it still fail in many respects where marriott should know how to do better.the room -lrb- 2269 -rrb- have the terrific new marriott revive bed , but the rest of the room be tired and in need of refurbishment .<ssssss>the carpet , furniture and wallcovering be wear out and shabby .<ssssss>the bathroom smell badly of mold in the shower , and i try in vain to find the source of the terrible smell .<ssssss>bath towel be cheap and small , and they do not stock adequate number in the room for a resort hotel where you may shower a couple time a day come and go from you activity .<ssssss>even just better linen would have class the room up a great deal .<ssssss>no robe .<ssssss>tolietry be average .<ssssss>standard glaring fluorescent light in all the lamp which always make it too bright in one part of the room and pitch black in another part .<ssssss>the room do have a great lanai which be fun to sit on for the sunsets.my room rate , book on -lsb- -- -rsb- , be $ 191/night , which be fairly reasonable these day now that hotel price be so high .<ssssss>they accidentally put another guest 's bill under my door , and he be pay $ 269 .<ssssss>elevator be undergo renovation , mean a 5-10 minute wait most time , sometimes wait for two or three elevator car because you be stand in the lobby with 20 other people also waiting.i eat two time at the poolside restaurant on the third floor overlook the beach .<ssssss>each time i find the food of crappy theme park snackbar quality , the service nonchalant and slow , and the price high .<ssssss>i be really take by the big bowl on every table of individual packet of every imaginable condiment ... be this how you serve ketchup and mustard in a place with any class at all ?<ssssss>ick .<ssssss>my simple lunch with two fruity hawaius cocktail run over $ 40 .<ssssss>dinner one evening in the steakhouse , also on the third floor , be delicious -lrb- the steak really be as great as they claim -rrb- and the service be really attentive , but i be befuddle by the restaurant 's decor which be a odd cross between denny 's and a chinese restaurant and have a bunch of vinyl seat and fake plant .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i also find it funny how they advertise a beach view for the restaurant , and the picture window be about the same size as the one on the front of my house back home .<ssssss>unless you get one of three or four table by the window , forget about see the beach.i agree with another poster that the pool be really small for a property of this size .<ssssss>the one nearest the beach get the most traffic and it be teeny-tiny and chock full of kid and middle-aged fat man in speedo .<ssssss>the back pool always look empty to I and much quieter.there be lot of shop on-site and nearby , and the hotel really be in the heart of everything , which be a huge plus .<ssssss>all the fun stuff in waikiki be within a 1-15 minute walk.valet parking -lrb- at $ 25/day -rrb- be fast , efficient and professional .<ssssss>my car be always wait when i call down before leave the room .<ssssss>self parking be $ 15/day .<ssssss>every staff member i encounter be friendly and helpful.overall , if i have to stay at a marriott , and i be really loyal , i would stay here again .<ssssss>if i be open to other property , i would definitely consider something more fresh and a little more refined elsewhere in waikiki .<ssssss>i will be back again if they renovate !<ssssss>
5 5 4 3 5 4 5 3		a place to remember .<ssssss>part of the reception area<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 3 -1 3 -1		i would rather stay at a motel 6 my wife and i stay at this hotel while we be in town for a friend 's wedding .<ssssss>the hotel be one of three suggest in the wedding invitation , so we do not bother to research it .<ssssss>too bad for we .<ssssss>we pay $ 150 for one night .<ssssss>guess what ?<ssssss>parking be extra -- $ 35 per day to be exact .<ssssss>the hotel itself do not have a garage though , so when you want to retrieve you car , you will need to wait at least 15 minute for a valet to drive it to the hotel from a distant facility.the room really leave a lot to be desire .<ssssss>the wallpaper in we room be probably fairly old , as it be peel away at the edge .<ssssss>the baseboard and ceiling molding be very ding up and appear to have be paint so many time that much of the detail be lose .<ssssss>this may seem like nitpicking , but it really contribute to the impression that the hotel be simply old and in need of real renovation.when the bellhop escort we to we room , he make a point of tell we that the hotel have recently undergo several upgrade , include new bed , new carpet and new television .<ssssss>the bed and the carpet be fine , and the tv be certainly new , but the reception be not much better than could be obtain with a pair of rabbit ears.when i first try to take a shower , i be not able to get any hot water .<ssssss>i call down to the desk to inquire if they be aware of any problem with the hot water delivery and be instruct to let the water run for about 5 minute .<ssssss>that work , though it be certainly wasteful and inconvenient .<ssssss>i should mention that we be only on the third floor .<ssssss>assume the hot water be pump from the basement , i wonder how long one would have to wait if on the top floor ?<ssssss>additionally , after flush , the toilet in we room require about 15 minute to shut off .<ssssss>the tank fill up promptly , but for whatever reason , the float do not shut off the valve.lastly , for $ 150 per night , one might expect the the chain to at least splurge on the tp and kleenex , but as with everything else , the price tag do not reflect the reality .<ssssss>these two amenity be of the single-ply sandpaper variety.i would have be much happer at a motel 6 .<ssssss>it would have cost considerably less and the facility would probably have be in much better shape .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 5 4 2		love the hotel , hate the pipe my wife and i stay next door to my brother and he wife on the 9th floor for one night .<ssssss>we be elate with the hotel .<ssssss>the priceline price be great , the location be great , the hotel be great .<ssssss>everything have meet or exceed we expection .<ssssss>other than the expensive parking , the one thing that happen that totally ruin we stay be the plumbing .<ssssss>at 5am , the pipe in we bathroom start moan and creak loudly and i can not stress loudly enough here .<ssssss>now i have hear this before ; i know what it be , but this go on continuously for 2 straight hour .<ssssss>we be try to ignore it and go back to sleep , but that be impossible .<ssssss>this be we one day to sleep in a little and it totally ruin we stay .<ssssss>i can not say that it happen every morning or even on every floor , but it happen to we and that be the reason i can not give this hotel a better rating .<ssssss>
3 5 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		reasonable , clean , close to the beach we spend 7 night in latter part of march .<ssssss>the queen badly need updating-paint , sink , carpeting , etc. but it be clean extremely close to everything : 1/2 block to the beach , next to the park , zoo , denny 's other restaurant .<ssssss>traffic be very noisy at waikiki , no matter where we walk .<ssssss>we room be a corner very quiet .<ssssss>we never do hear we neighbor at all .<ssssss>buffet in in-house restaurant be generous reasonably price .<ssssss>one thing we do not like be that we room be never clean until after 3 pm each day -- do they need more housekeeping help ???<ssssss>we would stay here again , simply because of the proximity to the beach -- which by the way be much less crowd at this end of the beach -lrb- diamond head -rrb- versus further toward downtown .<ssssss>

2 4 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		very disappointed in the gran bahia principe first , the positive comment : the hotel be gorgeous , the room very spacious and attractive , everything immaculate , and the grounds beautiful .<ssssss>the pool be crystal clear and of a temperature which make they refreshing yet comfortable at the same time .<ssssss>we never have any trouble find lounge chair .<ssssss>the beach be absolutely beautiful and you can literally walk for mile .<ssssss>when we encounter staff who provide good service , it go beyond good to excellent .<ssssss>now for the problem .<ssssss>we have check this website prior to we trip and be encourage by the high rating and the very large proportion of positive comment .<ssssss>however , be concern about report of a swamp , mosquito , and a pervasive sewer odor , we ask we travel agent to please check these specifically .<ssssss>she check with the nolitour representative , and she tell we that none of those negative report be accurate .<ssssss>thus imagine we surprise and disappointment when we discover that we room be border by not one but two swamp -lrb- the nolitour rep that we later speak with initially refuse to call they swamp but when press , she do concede that they be marsh -rrb- ; certainly there be mosquito to the extent that we could not use we balcony during the evening ; and there be a very pronounced sewer odor constantly in the main buffet dining room -lrb- which the nolitour rep deny ever have experience -rrb- and in the lobby bar .<ssssss>to top it off , i get what i believe be food poisoning there and spend the last three day of my trip -lrb- and the first two week of my return -rrb- with nausea , vomit , and diarrhea -lrb- with a antibiotic , the symptom eventually go away although it take I more than two week to completely recover -rrb- .<ssssss>the nolitour rep blame these symptom on too much sun , too much food , and too much drinking -lrb- none of which be true in my case -rrb- .<ssssss>i can not help but wonder if there be a connection between the sewer odor and my illness .<ssssss>service be hit or miss , mostly miss .<ssssss>there be some excellent staff people -lrb- we chambermaid and one of the dining room server , for example -rrb- who be always pleasant and do a very good job ; but for the most part service be very lax and the vast majority of the staff always have very sullen expression and do not seem happy to be do what they be do .<ssssss>if i have not become ill , i would have rate this hotel probably at 3 or maybe even 4 star , but the illness put I over the top so to speak .<ssssss>i can not recommend this resort to anyone , and i certainly will never travel with nolitour again .<ssssss>
3 4 2 5 3 4 4 4		love the sun deck and pool a large group of we book three room here for a week .<ssssss>when we arrive , two of the three room do not meet the spec that we have ask for .<ssssss>the two room have a awful smell ; after complain the next day , we be move to adequate room and we have no problem for the rest of the trip.the location be great .<ssssss>only a five-minute walk from waikiki beach and located right in the middle of ton of restaurant , shop , and local markets.the sun deck at the resort be amazing .<ssssss>the pool look really nice , and there be lot of place to sit and enjoy the sun .<ssssss>what i really enjoy be the free wireless internet here .<ssssss>the connection be excellent .<ssssss>keep in mind though , i could not get any wireless in the hotel room ; only one wire connection be available , and this may be difficult for two laptop in one room!breakfast be good .<ssssss>free muffin , coffee , fruit , and juice.i would recommend this place for people who be just look for a place to stay with nothing fancy .<ssssss>
1 1 1 1 1 2 4 -1		give it a miss look at some of the review i be expect a decent hotel .<ssssss>i should have take note of the other comment .<ssssss>it be difficult to reconcile the positive comment about this hotel with the hotel i stay in and it make I wonder whether some of the positive comment be connect with the owner as they be so far out from my experience or whether there be another hotel of the same name.its not near a beach unless near means far .<ssssss>its near nothing actually .<ssssss>my room be smelly and you could not walk barefeet on the carpet without foot stick to it .<ssssss>ughh.avoid<ssssss>
1 1 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		rude !<ssssss>it be too bad that they have a front desk staff that should never be allow to work in any service industry .<ssssss>we be not give the rate we be promise over the phone thru a 1-800 number , but charge a $ 100 more with not even the possibility of they take any money off.that would have be bad enough but most frustrating be the horrible attitude of the people at the front desk .<ssssss>it be as if you be suppose to be thankful that you be even allow to stay in they hotel.i would never stay here again or recommend it ... go somewhere where the still vibrant and friendly new orlean spirit survives.too bad because the location be good and the king bed be very comfortable ... elevator be awful .<ssssss>
4 2 4 -1 3 -1 5 -1		great hotel staff - avoid suite 222 at all cost this review would have 2 star if not for the staff .<ssssss>i research hollywood hotel for quite a while , and love magic castle 's spacious 2 bedroom site with the hip , new furniture display on the magic castle 's website .<ssssss>we family arrive and be usher to suite 222 , the one room outside the hotel which be a -lrb- recently ? -rrb-<ssssss>convert studio .<ssssss>it be dingy , have only 1 of the 2 promise bathroom , offer closet so musty that i immediately re-close the door , and a shower the size of a coffin .<ssssss>but the real horrible twist be the paper-thin wall and the loud noise from the street .<ssssss>i immediately request a room change but none be available and the newbie clerk say just close the window .<ssssss>with all window close , this heavy sleeper be awoken multiple time and finally crawl into bed with she child in a inner room where noise be still heard.i go to the clerk the next morning almost in tear : for $ 250 a night , i expect more , at least a decent night of sleep .<ssssss>she end up refund the night 's charge , assign we to a new room -lrb- switch we with new unfortunate guest -rrb- , and treat we to a box of treat .<ssssss>very pleasant .<ssssss>the new room be all that i have expect : light , roomy , and hip .<ssssss>no street noise since we be in a courtyard off the street .<ssssss>it be recently renovate but already wear be show through , but still , after that nightmare suite 222 , it be heaven.great staff .<ssssss>ready , helpful , and pleasant .<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 5 4 5 -1		great hotel , great location i recommend this hotel .<ssssss>the hotel griffon be a very nice boutique hotel located in the financial district .<ssssss>the room be small , but newly renovate and quite comfortable .<ssssss>the staff be extremely nice and willing to please .<ssssss>there be a lot of very nice restaurant within walk distance , especially cosmopolitan .<ssssss>the ferry building be around the corner and the bus line that run up market to union square be within a couple of blocks.the hotel lower they on-line price after i have make reservation .<ssssss>when i inquire about get the new discounted rate they be more than happy to accommodate I .<ssssss>
4 4 4 3 5 5 5 1		great location , good service central location , comfortable room .<ssssss>have a noisy airconditioner .<ssssss>they fix it within a hour after we call .<ssssss>shower be hot with good pressure .<ssssss>no real complaint about the room .<ssssss>location be good for connection to other part of sydney .<ssssss>half way between two rail station within a couple block .<ssssss>if you exit the back of the hotel you find yourself on elizabeth street with easy access to the bus line and cab .<ssssss>hotel restaurant be decent .<ssssss>we have a hard time find a open restaurant close by after 5pm .<ssssss>internet access be worse than dial-up .<ssssss>spend a lot of time on phone with they internet provider .<ssssss>could not find a internet cafe nearby either .<ssssss>
3 2 2 4 4 4 3 3		we be slightly dissapoint the hotel be modern , the staff friendly , the breakfast-buffet great and the location very central with a city-bus cover all the major attraction in berlin right outside the door .<ssssss>but as mention we be slightly disappointed .<ssssss>the largest problem be that the modern room design , with door choose for they look , and not for they sound-insulating capability .<ssssss>the result be that privacy on the loo be only possible by turn up the television-volume .<ssssss>the maid not respect the do-not-disturb light and the complementary shampoo smell like clean detergent be also letdown .<ssssss>consider the price of the room we can therefore only rate the hotel as average .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 2 3 2		good location if you be a sport fan the review of this hotel make we approach a bit nervously , but we come want to give it a fair chance .<ssssss>we room be book online , and we stay for 3 night over super bowl weekend .<ssssss>the facility be adequate , and certainly not awful -lrb- no bedbug , roach , or problem mention in other review -rrb- .<ssssss>but there be a number of little quirk , and a couple of big problem that may or may not have be the hotelâs fault .<ssssss>first , the quirk : carpet -lrb- room and hallway -rrb- not terrible , but could use replacement .<ssssss>low shower pressure .<ssssss>bedside lamp and clock be unplugged , and the plug be behind the mattress , where they would get jossled loose repeatedly .<ssssss>bed be of different heightsâIâm not sure why .<ssssss>fitness room be only a few bike and treadmillsâno weight .<ssssss>none of these be big problem , but just little quirk .<ssssss>now , about the bigger problem .<ssssss>we be surprise that we be charge a daily fee for a in-room safe , and a resort fee .<ssssss>not that these fee be a lot , but we would appreciate know ahead of time .<ssssss>second , we have no idea that the hotel have rent out the bar and restaurant to another company that be sell superbowl ticket and admission to they pre-game and during-game party .<ssssss>part of we attraction to book this hotel be the possibility of watch the big game in they sport bar .<ssssss>we be shock to find out that admission to the bar during the super bowl would be $ 400 .<ssssss>they also have another $ 400 pre-game party .<ssssss>-lrb- we talk they down to $ 50 for the super bowl meal , which be admittedly a pretty good buffet . -rrb-<ssssss>again , these issue may have be the fault of the company that rent the restaurant space , rather than the hotel itself .<ssssss>lesson learn : be sure to find out ahead of time whether a special event in the area make a difference in the price of the hotel amenity .<ssssss>to sum up we review , el palacio have the best location for sport fan , be the closest to dolphin stadium .<ssssss>but if you miami plan be more about beach or other activity , you should stay in south beach or somewhere else .<ssssss>and be sure to investigate thoroughly whether a special event in the area will affect the price of meal , parking , and other amenity .<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 4 -1 3 -1		love the muse my daughter and i have stay at the muse three time , and i be surprise by some of the very negative comment post by guest .<ssssss>time square be a very noisy area , so i think it be unrealistic to expect that a hotel located in the heart of the theatre district will be quiet , but i have not experience a uncomfortable noise level during any of my stay .<ssssss>the location be wonderful for theatre and dining , and be convenient to the subway for other excursion .<ssssss>the bed be one of the most comfortable that i have sleep on , the room be plenty large for two people -lrb- the last two time we also have a pull out couch in we room -rrb- , and the bathroom be great ... especially the baudelaire soap which we now use regularly at home .<ssssss>we do not like the bar -lrb- very pricey and unfriendly -rrb- and have not dine in the district .<ssssss>the staff be efficient and responsive .<ssssss>since we focus when come to new york be on see show , the muse continue to be we first choice for lodging .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 3 3 3 4		poor hotel - there be much better around here be the list of problem with this hotel : - tiny room -lrb- they obviously divide they exist room in half -rrb- - power point in very inconvenient location - water take up to 2 minute to heat up to be warm/hot - certain tap do not work at all - no clock in room -lrb- i.e. no alarm clock -rrb- for the location , and the price , there be much better hotel around union square .<ssssss>i will never stay here again .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 3 4 5		fabulous location we choose this hotel because it be not the typical chain hotel like four season etc. sometimes with these once you have be to one you know what to expect.the lobby be very none descript and not at all like the picure on the internet - the entrance off maddison ave be the grand elaborate one - we arrive on the 5th jan and all the christmas decoration be still there - very pretty.check in be very efficient if a little expensive - tip for taxi driver , door man , man who take luggage to reception , then man who take we up to we room , then man who bring we luggage up to we room all within the space of 20 minute of arrive when you be still get use to the new note and havent always get small amount at hand.our room be large , immaculatly clean and overlook st patrick cathedral - the view at night be stunning .<ssssss>the bed be huge and after hour of shopping and sightseeing we fall into what feel like a giant white marshmellow - it be so comfortable.we stay 5 night room only so didnt really use the hotel for much other than sleep in .<ssssss>we do have a drink in the lobby bar - the service be shocking but then another night we have one in the new restaurant bar and that be very nice - decor be fantastic.we do use the concierge who be all very helpfull and manage to get we book into all the very best restaurant - use the zagat guide book if you like good food - quite a lot of the best one be within walk distance of the hotel the best be le bernadin - truly sublime -lrb- no problem walk round at night -rrb- iin the room there be a concierge guide which be very helpful and do give some fantastic recommendation for all sort of thing - its nothing to do with the hotel - its a list of recommendation from a variety of 5 star hotel in the city and be very informative.we do enquire about a show with the concierge who say they have to use a agency and quote $ 1200 for two of we - yes one thousand two hundred dollar to see jersey boy - we declined.all in all we really enjoy we stay here the hotel be a fantastic location , sak be just over the road on fifth ave , central park be a ten minute walk away and the room have a stunning view at night be big , comfortable and spotless .<ssssss>can not ask for much more !!<ssssss>
3 4 4 2 5 2 3 3		nice hotel , but expensive there be many mixed review about this hotel so hopely this one will be somewhat informative .<ssssss>first of all the hotel be located quite some distance from the city center .<ssssss>if you need to get there from the amsterdam train station it be tram # 2 .<ssssss>-lrb- in a altered state at night the night bus be # 358 -rrb- you can also take the metro , but its quite a walk from the metro station , about 2 mile .<ssssss>its located somewhat between amsterdam city center and the airport .<ssssss>its in the same building complex with ibm and other corporation .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very interesting .<ssssss>the front desk staff be not the nicest .<ssssss>not quite rude , but somewhat arrogant .<ssssss>once we get to we room , i have to say it be nice .<ssssss>the only room leave be a smoking room on the 8th floor cost 138 euro .<ssssss>very very expensive , but somewhat average amongst the other amsterdam hotel .<ssssss>the room be nice with a double bed and a flat screen tv .<ssssss>the bathroom be also very nice with standard ammenity .<ssssss>the room come equipe with a mini-bar , and pay-per-view movie -lrb- 12 euro each -rrb- .<ssssss>overall , not a bad hotel .<ssssss>the distance from city center be significant but honestly it be still very accessable by tram or night bus require just a short walk .<ssssss>the neighborhood be very safe and quiet so it be not at all a concern .<ssssss>if the price be not so high and staff be not soo stick up , i would highly recommend this hotel<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 2 3 3 -1		serve its purpose my husband and i have reservation at the st. marie antoinette hotel but i guess they be overbook because they send we to the saint loui hotel instead .<ssssss>we have friend stay at the marie antoinette and they room be horrible , so when we first walk into we room at the saint loui we be initially pretty happy .<ssssss>the room be very large and we have two large french door lead onto a small balcony overlook a courtyard .<ssssss>you can definitely tell that this be a old hotel .<ssssss>it be not gross-dirty , but it be musty and i kepy my flip flop on almost the whole time .<ssssss>since we be visit new orlean to drink and have a good time , the hotel definitely serve its purpose as a place for we to crash after late night bar hop , especially since it be practically on bourbon street .<ssssss>around 4 a.m. on saturday night we awake to what sound like wwius right outside we door .<ssssss>we be able to fall back asleep but if you stay here definitely plan on hearing loud music , police siren and scream drunk right outside you window/door .<ssssss>besides the noise , we stay at the hotel saint loui be fine .<ssssss>if i could get the same price again i would probably stay here for another weekend of fun in new orlean .<ssssss>
1 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		bali hilton fact not fiction for the potential honeymooner as a senior employee with one of the big 4 global accounting firm i often stay in 4/5 star hotel all over the world on business trip , so i should have a moderately good understanding what be a 4 or 5 star hotel .<ssssss>the bali hilton in my opinion be not a 4 or 5 star hotel , in fact i would rate it 3 or 3 plus at best .<ssssss>the principal reason for this rating be : a overall lack of service , as a guest i feel that i be a type of commodity rather than a value customer , hotel staff while not rude be not in my opinion concern with provide service to I or see if everything be acceptable to me.the lack of variety of quality foodthe lack of romantic aura of the hotela feeling that i really do not get value for my money after visit other hotel in nusa dua that charge similar prices.i have detail below my principal issue as to why this be not a 4 or 5 star hotel below .<ssssss>i would strongly advise anyone against honeymoon at the bali hilton if you be expect to pay for a romantic holiday or alternatively be look for a value for money holiday .<ssssss>my poor opinion of the bali hilton be reinforce when we start frequent other nusa dua hotel for dinner in order to get a impression of the range of quality hotel accomodation and service available .<ssssss>base on we assessment of the hotel in the eastern nusa dua area i personally would only stay at the sheraton lagoona if i want a romantic holiday.my issue with my stay at the bali hiltonthe massive entrance and lobby that contain two bar be a pure facade , the two bar be rarely use by large number of guest , in the evening there be a singer at one of the bar but no one be ever there to really listen and the quality of the entertainment could be questioned.the hotel look to be age rapidly , both in structure and vegatation -lrb- i believe it be build in the late eigty or early ninety -rrb- and be in need of serio renovation .<ssssss>the vegatation and tropical plant in place appear to be on they last leg and the gardening be shabby in a lot of place particularly when compare to other nusa dua hotel such as the nusa dua beach hotel and the sheraton lagoona .<ssssss>the lift in we grande room block be not modern and regularly be out of service during we stay , which when you be on the 5th floor can be kind of annoying.do not get a ocean view room it be not worth the additional expense as you will not be on a beach front look out onto the sea but will be look at the sea from a tight angle and from a distance of several hundred metres.the reception area be understaffed and the staff or assistant manager seem incapable of multi-tasking so guest be often wait to be serve while the assistant manager sit around .<ssssss>this happen to I on a number of occasion where i be wait 10-15 minute to be served.the pool be ok in my opinion and the beach be probably larger in both width and length than most of the other hotel but be steeply inclined and it be about a 30 second walk from the sunbathe area to the water edge .<ssssss>note there be no sun lounger on the beach so you be not close to the water 's edge i.e. 5-10 metre away.the hotel have a massive green lagoon area around which most of the restaurant be situate , which appear to be a kind of nature area .<ssssss>however , certain area i.e. the north-west corner of the lagoon start to smell strongly of sewage during the evening .<ssssss>i do mention this to the management.the hotel gym-workout facility be not own by the hotel and therefore be not free of charge , you be require to pay usd 4 for a day pass to use the gym facilities.issues with we room include the shower need to be run for 5-7 minute prior to the hot water come through which seem hypocritical consider the hotel 's reccomendation that guest try to save water .<ssssss>obviously the quality of every room may not be the same as ours .<ssssss>the balcony table wobble so badly it be difficult to eat room service on it while not a major issue it be sometimes inconvenient .<ssssss>the tv reception quality be poor for the majority of satellite channel , i do mention this to management while i be there.the hotel do not in my opinion openly market the menu and location of its restaurant , it be not until the third week of we stay that we find out where the meditteranean and pub bar were.at the towel area you be require to sign for towel and put you room number , however when you return the towel nothing be request of you .<ssssss>why not a real be , why this process be necessary except for statistically gather the datum of how many towel each room use i do not know.in my opinion one of the main issue with the hotel be that it have no real open air restaurant , ok the waterfall and the indonesian restaurant be open air but they be not really romantic in my opinion .<ssssss>for example at the sheraton lagoona you can have have a romantic evening meal by the beach or in one of they special romantic canopy hut , this be not possible at the bali hilton.the menu of the pool bar be limit , and tend to have a lot of deep fried item , i do not think that the food have a kind of care about it that would make you think it be high quality .<ssssss>about 10-15 % of the time the staff would bring I the a drink i do not order but more importantly they do not check guest requirement that often , for example in my opinion at the pool the staff would walk around check guest may be once a hour and generally it be quicker to go to the bar and order.breakfast be kind of a third us/uk , a third continental european and a third asian .<ssssss>in my experience the breakfast hostess be not that friendly .<ssssss>the strength of the tea serve at breakfast be poor as it turn a grey-cream colour when you add milk .<ssssss>i suggest to the manager that they put the tea bags on the table for guest to choose and have the waiter serve boiling water .<ssssss>
4 2 1 5 4 1 5 1		great 3 star not a 4 star hotel this be a great 3 star hotel .<ssssss>it can not be a 4 star because if you walk down the hill to the westin palace that be a 5 star just one better and thus this be not a 4 .<ssssss>it be a good three star and if you get the price of a 3 you have a great find .<ssssss>the issue be the total package .<ssssss>there be no lobby .<ssssss>the restaurant be a after think in a town know for great food .<ssssss>a $ 20 + breakfast be basically a standard bacon sausage and amenitite buffet keep warm too long .<ssssss>the diunner be basic .<ssssss>the room choice vary from the magnificent 202 to a literal dungeon 03 .<ssssss>i be not kid a dungeon be a room with no real window and it be dark all the time and it at the lowest point in the hotel thus room 03 .<ssssss>so the ability to predict a great experience be base on what be available .<ssssss>if you be fly here from the usa you have better insist on a certain type of room as all of the good one be go by 1800 .<ssssss>what make it a great 3 star be the cleanliness , the location , walk to the thyssen , the prado the archeologie museo , the botanical garden or the park .<ssssss>a quick tube stop to almost anywhere else .<ssssss>the bathroom be all in marble and the floor be wood which be nice unless the person above you walk around in heal which then drive you crazy .<ssssss>the people be nice and helpful and the internet be free .<ssssss>so it be a great 3 star .<ssssss>there be no amenity other than the internet , so if you need a place to sleep and get a good rate and a nice choice of room you will feel like you be in heaven .<ssssss>if anyone of those do not happen you will feel sort of put off and if two do not happen you will wonder who those people be that write those glowing reviews.jim<ssssss>
5 5 3 3 4 5 -1 -1		great room !!<ssssss>i be very surprised at this hotel .<ssssss>i have read some very negative review of the hotel and be not expect a good experience .<ssssss>the hotel lobby and room be very clean .<ssssss>the bed and bedding be first rate .<ssssss>the room be not super large - but we be go to go on a cruise , so we be not bother with a smaller room .<ssssss>noise level be good in hotel .<ssssss>the breakfast in the morning be good .<ssssss>they keep it well stock and be clean the counter all the time .<ssssss>the only problem be try to find a place to sit , but there be tray that you could take the food back to you room .<ssssss>i would stay there again .<ssssss>
3 3 5 4 5 3 1 5		nice hotel , bad service my room be very nice .<ssssss>it be clean and comfortable and quiet .<ssssss>it be also walk distance to the forbid city -lrb- it be kind of a long walk though -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel service be terrible .<ssssss>the concierge service be worthless .<ssssss>every time i ask for a restaurant recommendation they seem surprised that i would be ask such a question , and they recommendation be never very good .<ssssss>i would stay here again because the hotel be very nice , but i would not rely on the concierge .<ssssss>if you do talk to the concierge , talk to one of the older guy and not the bell boy .<ssssss>
5 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		a relaxing experience ... my boyfriend and i go to san juan to ring in the new year .<ssssss>we stay at the ritz which be in isla verde .<ssssss>i have a good time overall .<ssssss>the service be excellent throughout we stay .<ssssss>we be there from dec. 30 until january 3 .<ssssss>we know the staff by name by the time we leave and they know we by name .<ssssss>there be a lot of family there with small child which surprise I .<ssssss>however , i do not see it as a problem and actually enjoy watch the little one enjoy themselves in the pool .<ssssss>isla verde be not a resort area .<ssssss>we have a 3rd floor room with really no view for about $ 800/night .<ssssss>the room be very standard but clean .<ssssss>we do not expect to spend a substantial time in the room anyway .<ssssss>we just want to stay in a nice hotel with such amenity .<ssssss>unlike the other premium hotel on the strip , the ritz be overall quiet and only frequent by the guest of the hotel .<ssssss>intercontinental and el san juan have too much go on for my taste because of all of the attraction in the hotel .<ssssss>also , the ritz provide every service that you can possibly imagine .<ssssss>this allow the guest to retreat in the hotel for the duration of they stay if they like .<ssssss>the casino be nothing to write home about but if you be a gambler i guess it will be ok .<ssssss>i be not a gambler .<ssssss>the spa service be ridiculously overpriced .<ssssss>i be unsure if the price quote to I be holiday price or everyday price .<ssssss>i just believe that a manicure and pedicure for $ 160 be absolutely ridiculous .<ssssss>although it be extremely pricy for the holiday , i definitely enjoy the ritz .<ssssss>if i go back again , i think i would stay in old san juan because it be less touristy and feel like you be on a island with rich history and tradition ... plus i may be able to find a cheaper yet still enjoyable experience .<ssssss>
4 5 4 4 5 5 3 3		very new and convenient , good value get very good rate on wotif and it be very close to causeway bay so i do not hesitate .<ssssss>when we arrive at the hotel we be pleasantly surprise by how new and modern the place look .<ssssss>the whole building be build 2 year ago from what i hear , so it be not some old formerly-nasty-but-refurbished building like a lot of place in hk be .<ssssss>room be a decent size , still slightly on the small side , but efficient and nicely decorate .<ssssss>naturally , everything be still new and in good condition .<ssssss>i get a room on the 31st floor , and the view from my room be brilliant .<ssssss>they have this clever little sensor that turn the room entrance light on when you walk towards the bathroom , which be very handy at night .<ssssss>overall , very good room with all the essential .<ssssss>the hotel be just across the street from tin hau station , literally .<ssssss>it be one stop away from cwb station and there be a lot of small restaurant around the area that be open into the late hour of the night .<ssssss>also the convenient store chain watson 's be next to the hotel so it be a breeze to buy thing you need .<ssssss>maybe this be why the mini bar in the room be completely empty .<ssssss>i like this location very much , as it be close enough to cwb but away from the craziness .<ssssss>breakfast be not include in the good rate i get , but i try the breakfast here anyway .<ssssss>it be all right , could have be better in term of variety .<ssssss>main grouse -- i do not know if the wall here be thin or if it be because they put I in a adjoining room with my colleague but i could hear she in she room .<ssssss>if i could hear she cough and blow dry she hair then she can hear I .<ssssss>it do not give I a feeling of privacy .<ssssss>also , i know it be not standard but it be always a nice touch to provide free internet in the room .<ssssss>here they still ask you to pay .<ssssss>i would have give this place 5 point if it be not for these 2 thing .<ssssss>however , it be still a very nice hotel with great value and i would recommend this place to anyone and would stay here again .<ssssss>
5 5 5 3 5 3 4 5		have to be the best hotel value in l.a. !<ssssss>i book this hotel base on the many good review i read here on trip advisor .<ssssss>this be my last night in this hotel and i could not be happier with the choice .<ssssss>i do not usually travel alone , and though a new york city native , i do have some trepidation about stay alone in a hotel in l.a.i agree with all of the reviewer who mention the excellent security at this hotel .<ssssss>there be camera everywhere and yes , the front desk be behind a glass partition .<ssssss>rather than make I nervous by they mere existence , they really have make I feel safer.as for the room , i can not understand how other reviewer have describe this place as a basic , no-frills hotel .<ssssss>my room be extremely spacious , as be most of the other i have see in pass .<ssssss>all the room i have see have be renovate : the vanity be granite , with a new faucet .<ssssss>the bathtub surround be flat-panel stone , with none of the grout and tile that can be cover with mold .<ssssss>in fact , the bedroom and bath be spotless .<ssssss>there be a small , quiet refrigerator and a microwave that sit on granite shelf , and both be also completely clean .<ssssss>the king-sized bed be cover in a luxurious-looking burnt-orange shiny quilted new-looking bedspread .<ssssss>the bed itself could be a little softer , but it be not rock-hard either ; this non-sleeper have sleep well .<ssssss>even the entry doorsill and hinge have be replace .<ssssss>there be a desk , armoire , table , and three chair , and there be still a huge amount of room to walk around .<ssssss>the carpet be not old , but during my stay all of the room be have the carpet restretch and clean .<ssssss>the shower be good , with a new , adjustable showerhead .<ssssss>the lighting be good in the bedroom and bathroom , and there be two telephone .<ssssss>my only complaint be that the table and one of the chair could use replacement.the lobby be small , but furnish with newer furniture in excellent condition , and the small breakfast room be bright and modern , too.a number of people write about the somewhat seedy neighborhood .<ssssss>have drive back all the way on sunset from west hollywood to the hotel , the neighborhood do change - store and restaurant be close and largely ethnic , mostly hispanic .<ssssss>it certainly do not have the glitz and polish and lighting of the area i be come from .<ssssss>but not once do i feel unsafe .<ssssss>i do not use the underground parking , because the lobby be at one end of a small strip mall with outdoor parking , and i be able to park one foot away from the hotel lobby.after book this hotel by call choice 's 800 number , i later do a comparison on choice hotel 's own website among this hotel and four other comfort inn in the area .<ssssss>i be dismay to see that this be the only one that do not have high speed internet service list for the room .<ssssss>i be about to cancel my reservation , but then decide to call choice to verify it .<ssssss>they make a direct call to the hotel and tell I that they do indeed have high speed in all the room .<ssssss>i be use it right now , and it have work perfectly.i do not have a chance to check out the actual breakfast - i either sleep in or have to leave very early before they begin serve .<ssssss>but on my first morning i ask the desk after breakfast be over if i might be able to get some bread for toast .<ssssss>no problem .<ssssss>the guy at the desk call and get the woman in charge of breakfast to come down and get I some food .<ssssss>she give I a plate of bread and pastry and , of course , there be always coffee available.in closing , i must say that i be a snob about hotel .<ssssss>i absolutely can not stay in a old room ; i find it too depressing .<ssssss>and i be squeamish and easily skeeve , and will not tolerate anything that be not immaculate .<ssssss>also , i always stay in smoking room .<ssssss>this hotel room be not only one step away from be sterilize , it be also the only smoking room i have be in anywhere that do not have that nauseating , suffocating smell of stale smoke .<ssssss>and that go for the hallway , too , despite what one woman write about it .<ssssss>i can sniff out smoke anywhere , at any time , but not at this place .<ssssss>they be certainly do something right.this comfort inn have get to be the best deal in l.a. for $ 81 a night , you can not get better .<ssssss>and i would wager that you room in a high-rise hotel would not be any nicer .<ssssss>as long as you have a car and a map , it would be very short-sighted to stay somewhere else .<ssssss>if i return to l.a. , this will be my first , and only , choice .<ssssss>

1 3 1 4 1 4 2 -1		what a dump !!!!!!!!!!!!<ssssss>the hotel look great on the website and the amenity sound great , but the hotel be a total disaster .<ssssss>i say stay away from this resort : if you like you room clean before 3pm .<ssssss>if you like to use wash clothsif you do not like roach in the bathroomsif you like hot waterif you like good foodif you do not like to have salad leave out for hoursif you like clean dishesif you like clean towelsif you like top shelf liquorif you like to sleep and not hear the people in the other room.if you like to see the ocean view in you ocean view room -lrb- not the tree -rrb- yeah the price be good , but i can think of a lot of other place for the price .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 3 -1 2 -1		great location , pity about the view i stay in the victoria for 2 night at the end of october 2005 .<ssssss>if you be go to stay in amsterdam , i be sure you can find better ... the positive : excellent location , you cant miss it from the central stationroom spacious and cleanthe bed comfortablethe negative : there be alot of building work go on to the outside of the hotel itself , which not only cause lot of noise , but obstruct any view overlook the station as there be lot of scaffolding and netting.there be lot of building work go on near the station too , as they be convert the entrance - so the area be noisy and very unattractive.many problem have checking in , which be not until 3pmthe drink in the bar be very expensiveour maid / or whoever clean we room after the first night decide to -lrb- shall we say -rrb- relieve herself of she waste in we toilet - so it smelt.our tv brokeno milk for we tea/coffee .<ssssss>pleasant enough hotel , just go somewhere else!amsterdam as a city though be lot and lot of fun !!!!!!<ssssss>
1 1 -1 3 -1 3 2 -1		not recommend i stay for 4 night and do not enjoy my stay at all .<ssssss>admittedly , i would opt for the cheapest room type -lrb- attic , no window -rrb- but find the room to be extremely small and noisy due to the bed be right up against the paper-thin corridor wall .<ssssss>this be compound by other guest run up and down the corridor at all hour with creak floorboard , slam door - all make worse when you be lie in the bed which be but right up to the wall .<ssssss>bathroom be also very tiny and barely big enough to move around in.the only positive thing to say be the reception and ground floor public area which have nice rustic charm.overall , unless you be on a very tight budget , i would steer clear .<ssssss>

2 3 2 2 5 2 2 5		unhelpful staff , small room my husband , two dtr and i stay here for 4 night .<ssssss>the hotel be stylish but its position be rather suspect as adjoining the tenderloin , consequently it be often a battle to walk from union square to the lobby door at night without be approach by homeless , druggie , drunk , itinerant folk etc. a reality check for the kid but all rather depress after a while .<ssssss>we book a double double room on a high floor which be quiet and very clean and well furnished but as state by previous reviewer very small .<ssssss>once we 4 case be bring it there be hardly room to get around the bed .<ssssss>the bathroom have insufficient storage / shelve for a mum and 2 dtr !!<ssssss>there be a bar / restaurant attach which do great cocktail but this be not very well publicize by reception staff who be polite but not that helpful.my husband leave he credit card in a nearby atm just before we check out .<ssssss>when he go to pay he realise and have to use my card .<ssssss>he explain to staff what have happen and then spend 45 min try to get through to cc company in uk on he mobile to cancel the card , he be very stressed as the call be be frequently cut off .<ssssss>the reception staff do nothing to help , do not offer he the use of they phone or a private room as he have check out .<ssssss>leave he to call from a very public lobby area.their attitude seem to be that the bill be pay so job do very dissappointing service , very impersonal , overall it sully we view of the place which we think be slightly overprice anyway for a boutique hotel .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 3 5 5 3		fun for the family overall , this be a nice hotel .<ssssss>we check in late and the hotel be 100 % full .<ssssss>as a result , we receive a room in which the air conditioning do not work .<ssssss>the hotel say they be unaware of the problem prior to we arrival and would fix it .<ssssss>they forget to fix it .<ssssss>they do fix it on we second day at the property .<ssssss>they compensate we very well for the inconvenience!the room be nice , a very large 1 bedroom suite .<ssssss>housekeeping do not clean it very well after the prior guest , but they take care of that too.the facility be great for a family , lot of child 's activity for my 5 year old son .<ssssss>he love the waterslide , ping pong , tennis and hiking.our stay be smack in the middle of they busy season , and it show .<ssssss>the staff seem overwhelmed , maybe even under-manned .<ssssss>however , everyone we work with be great .<ssssss>they be harry yet remain polite , professional , helpful , gracious and sympathetic when necessary !<ssssss>any inconvenience we encounter be more than rectify by the staff!my son want to go back and we be actually look forward to it !<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 4 5 3 3		plus and minus of cm punta cana as i always read review prior book my vacation , i want to post a review again this year.last year , my husband and twin boy of 20 month then , go to the melia caribe in they new concierge section in punta cana and we really like we experience .<ssssss>however , i would not have recommend the melia caribe if you be in they regular sections.i also want to point out that i have travel in europe , north america and caribbean and therefore i have a lot of point of comparison .<ssssss>here be my review for club med punta cana .<ssssss>the main reason we select this resort be because of the petit club , which take care of 2 and 3 year old .<ssssss>we need to rest and do not have a babysitter so we take that resort .<ssssss>for a week it cost we $ 6,800 can from montreal .<ssssss>so it be not cheap.here be the plus1 .<ssssss>contrary to other review , i feel that the care at the petit club be great .<ssssss>however , i can not talk for minus club , i.e. 4 and up .<ssssss>although the kid at the mini club be have a blast .<ssssss>the manager and assist manager be certify educator from belgium and france and the other staff member be either from canada , england or haiti and frankly they really try they best to entertain the kid .<ssssss>they do not just watch they as oppose to what go on that the petit club at the melia resort .<ssssss>however that be for the day schedule only as the night shift from 7:30 pm to 9pm they put they in front of a tv or bring they to the kid ' show if one be on that night .<ssssss>we have a issue one night be we kid be leave with one g.o. , the light be off and they do not do anything .<ssssss>we do not like how management deal with the problem , ie .<ssssss>confront we version and the go version .<ssssss>anyway , the day staff be great .2 .<ssssss>the facility for the petit club be great as they have a area to nap , it be super clean , they have a very strict schedule they report on what the kid do , eat .<ssssss>there be also a lot of area that be not directly expose to the sun to protect the kidâs skin .3 .<ssssss>if you want to practice a activity whether sailing or archery the g.o be all well trained and professional .4 .<ssssss>the way the club be set up be nice as you always have a view of the beach from the beach .5 .<ssssss>the pool be big and there be a big section for kid so parent be not restricted to a small baby pool .6 .<ssssss>regular wine offer during meal be ok , i.e. you do not really have to purchase a la carte as oppose to the other resort be the house wine be not drinkable .7 .<ssssss>overall facility be very clean .8 .<ssssss>we be located in the punta cana building behind the petit club and close to everything on the resort .9 .<ssssss>there be a doctor and a nurse on site .10 .<ssssss>the resort be 5 minute from the airport.here be the minus .1 .<ssssss>the facility need to be update as it be very old and do not stand up to the price they be ask .2 .<ssssss>there be only buffet .<ssssss>although the buffet be better than those at other resort , most respectable resort now offer at least one or two a la carte restaurant .<ssssss>my kid be use to go to restaurant and the buffet do not work .<ssssss>they do not understand why everybody keep leave they seat , we always eat cold and it be not relax at all to eat .<ssssss>we rest during the day while the boy be at the daycare but be exhaust after dinner .<ssssss>if you kid can serve themselves it might be better .<ssssss>other than that i would not recommend it .3 .<ssssss>go be always interact with you .<ssssss>while most of they be nice , after a few day , talk to 25 year old go be not we thing .4 .<ssssss>there be not bar service around the pool or at the beach or alcohol in the room .<ssssss>as a result , you always have to get you own drink and it make it more difficult to enjoy you vacation with the kid .5 .<ssssss>while the beach be good for kid as there be no wave at all , it be not exceptional .<ssssss>i be tell club med always have the best spot i be disappoint .<ssssss>the melia beach on the bavaro beach be much nicer .6 .<ssssss>the atmosphere be very kid camp in the sense that there be always one or two activity organize go on whether at the beach , at the bar -lrb- only one bar -rrb- or in the pool .<ssssss>consequently it be harder to relax .<ssssss>however , if you be the type who always seek to participate in game , it be you place .7 .<ssssss>if you kid be not use to go to daycare , they will have a hard time at the petit club .<ssssss>i see many kid cry because they be not use to daycare .<ssssss>there be a limit to what care provider can do .8 .<ssssss>the resort be huge so it be easy to be far away from the main activity .9 .<ssssss>once night come , there be not much do to for the kid .<ssssss>there be only the main bar or reception where light be on .<ssssss>around the pool , it be slippery so it make it hard for parent to have a drink as the kid do not have a place to play .10 .<ssssss>while the place be orient towards family , there be only a shower without a bathtub in the room , which make it harder with young one .<ssssss>also , once the child be in bed , you can either go in you bed or go outside to the smallest balcony every to relax .<ssssss>if you want a drink you have to go to the bar and brink it back to you room.in conclusion , i be not impress with the club med experience .<ssssss>maybe the go thing be not for I nor the buffet .<ssssss>my father be from france and i travel to europe many time as well as in north america and i be very disappointed .<ssssss>it be overprice .<ssssss>maybe the renovate club med be nicer .<ssssss>but i would hesitate to try one until the boy be older -lrb- 7 or 8 -rrb- .<ssssss>in the meantime , we will go back to the melia chain such as paradisius who now offer concierge room for family and we might try a beach resort .<ssssss>
2 2 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		everyone be not treat the same ... very disappointing stay before book my reservation at the outrigger waikiki , i think i do my homework .<ssssss>i read every available book on this hotel to include the review from this website , travel advisor .<ssssss>this be my third time visit hawaius and my daugther 's first so i want to ensure that it to be very special for she .<ssssss>we arrive on a saturday and i call the hotel before take a taxi since we flight be early .<ssssss>i be tell that i could show up and if my room be available , then i could check in early since regular check in be 3 pm .<ssssss>we take a taxi to the hotel .<ssssss>wei be greet in the lobby by a very nice staff member who tell I to go sit and natalie would take care of I .<ssssss>as my daughter and i walk over to sit down , i immediately say hello natalie loud enough for natalie to hear .<ssssss>to my shock and surprise , natalie do not say a word back -lrb- no aloha or hello -rrb- to my daughter or i. ... this be not a good first impression by the outrigger staff which i have hear time and time again be friendly and outgoing .<ssssss>what do you say when something like this happen ?<ssssss>i just sit there in totally amazement ... no aloha , hello or even acknowledgement that perhaps natalie should exhibit the hawaiian attitude that draw so many people to waikikus .<ssssss>nothing .<ssssss>we be tell to return at 1:30 pm since we room be still not ready .<ssssss>at 1:30 pm we return and again , another rude front desk woman say that they be try to get we room ready as quickly as possible and that we should return at 3pm .<ssssss>i point out to the woman that 3pm be the regular check in time but she say that be the best they could do ... which be ok except for she go on and on how the outrigger be work quickly and that the room would be ready at 3pm as if they be go out of they way to assist we with a earlier arrival .<ssssss>we do return around 3:30 pm and after enter the room and notice that the room face the cheese cake factory and its huge loud fan , i return to the front desk and ask for my room to be change .<ssssss>well this do not sit well with the front desk .<ssssss>i tell they that for the kind of money i be spend for a six night stay , that there be no way i would not get a good night 's sleep with that fan on all night .<ssssss>this be one of the good thing that i learn in one of the travel advisor review be do not get a room that face the cheese factory fan !!!<ssssss>we be then move to a room that although it do not have two bed like i have request -lrb- just one king size bed -rrb- it be a definite improvement to the first room .<ssssss>no one at the front desk offer any information about service at the hotel and anything i eventually find out be on my own ... mahola !<ssssss>my daughter and i stay at the pool due to the water scare in waikiki because of pollution in the water a few week before .<ssssss>the pool attendant do not treat people fairly and only take care of those who pay they off on the side .<ssssss>it be so unfair .<ssssss>i pay to stay at this hotel like other customer yet if i do not slip the pool attendant a little extra , then no lounge chair for I or my daughter .<ssssss>this go again the rule of the pool that state if you arrive by 8:00 be then you can get a chair if available .<ssssss>day after day i would show up at 7:45 am and 2/3 of the chair have reserve sign on they yet the pool rule state that only at 8:00 be chair would be release .<ssssss>on my second to last day at the hotel , i ask one of the pool attendant about some of the chair that be vacant for more than four hour which he claim that the folk have just step away and would be back .<ssssss>well i be at the pool from 9 be until 2pm and never see anyone sit in these seat ... payoff ?<ssssss>you bet .<ssssss>i feel very discriminate against and even the waitress who serve drink from duke seem to focus on accomodate a specific crowd of folk although i tip 20 % each time .<ssssss>what give ?<ssssss>i be make to wait , i be ask for my id when i be 42 year of age and constantly ask if i be stay at the hotel , the duration of my stay or when i be leave .<ssssss>i do not feel welcome in the least .<ssssss>just discriminate against yet i pay just as well as the next person .<ssssss>luckily , my daughter be young and be not aware of the discrimination and i hope she never will have to feel the way i be mean to feel .<ssssss>paradise ?<ssssss>perhaps for some but for the average person i do not think so .<ssssss>maybe i do not have the right look , or maybe my new york accent be the thing that do it or maybe the staff who be suppose to treat all people the same , choose not to uphold the hawaiian tradition we have hear so much about ... mahola .<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		would stay here again in a heartbeat !<ssssss>we stay at the inglaterra hotel for 3 night in july .<ssssss>the hotel be situate in a excellent location near the rambla and numerous shop .<ssssss>the room and bathroom be extremely clean and of a good size .<ssssss>we room have a great balcony on the side of the hotel , so noise be never a problem .<ssssss>the hotel also have a lovely rooftop terrace with great view of the city .<ssssss>in addition , the food be excellent and of a reasonable cost .<ssssss>the only downside be that there be not any english channel on the tv .<ssssss>we would definately reccommend this hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 4 1 -1 4		nice hotel , lack customer service .<ssssss>after have stay at the club quarter in rockefeller center , we decide to try we luck at the one in san fran .<ssssss>we really enjoy we time in the new york hotel , and think that this experience would be similar .<ssssss>the hotel itself be not as impressive as they new york branch , but the stay itself be pleasant , no complaint about noise or the room.however , the main reason we book a stay here be for the weekend ` deal ' available to cq member company employee .<ssssss>the advertised rate be 69 dollar a night for friday , saturday and sunday night .<ssssss>we book about 2 month in advance to ensure we would be able to get the special rate .<ssssss>my boyfriend speak on the phone with they main booking agency and they be very helpful , but tell we that there be a special event go on saturday evening , so that we would not be able to recieve the discounted rate that night .<ssssss>we be ok with that , but the rate be expect to jump to around $ 130 for that one evening .<ssssss>however , upon check out , serious flaw in they seamless check-in/check-out be make apparant .<ssssss>the most serious problem i see with the electronic check in check out that they have be that they staff be totally un-oriented with they own hotel policy when a problem arise !!<ssssss>we check out electronically , and we reciept be for 450 dollar , and have quote totally wrong price for each night .<ssssss>the staff we discuss we problem with be friendly , but have no idea that they even offer a special rate to corporate member on the weekend .<ssssss>he seem to think that we should have be pay more on a weekend , and be totally confuse with something that be clearly display all over they website .<ssssss>frankly , i be extremly upset , since we have stay in the financial district on a weekend -- obviously not the most exciting place to stay in the city , but we have do it for the special price .<ssssss>we could have stay somewhere nicer , with close attraction , not pay a lot for cab , if we have know earlier that we would not indeed , be recieve a special price .<ssssss>we even show the clerk we confirmation that quote the price we would be pay .<ssssss>he say that price be subject to change base on room availablility .<ssssss>that be pretty much b , since you can not charge someone more for a service once they have book it .<ssssss>the whole experience leave a very bad taste in my mouth , and i find it insulting that if you go to the clerk for check-in/check-out , they direct you to they electronic machine for check in .<ssssss>the motel 6 will personally check I in , but not a hotel room that i end up pay 160 dollar for ?!<ssssss>come on club quarter , have some class .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 5 4 4 1		clean , but that be about it the hotel be clean , but it be like something out of the 70 's .<ssssss>everything need to be update .<ssssss>can not even control the temperature in the room .<ssssss>if you be a techie , this hotel be definately not for you .<ssssss>the room only have three prong power outlet in the bathroom .<ssssss>i have to plug the laptop into the bathroom and use it sit on the floor because the power cord would not reach the desk .<ssssss>moreover , the wireless connection be not free and it be terrible .<ssssss>i lose internet connection every 5-10 minutes.i would recommend spend a few buck more and stay somewhere else .<ssssss>i will not be back .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 5 5 5 4		great hotel !<ssssss>stay at the hotel albe from july 14th to the 20th .<ssssss>it be in a fantastic location , the staff be amazing and the room be very clean .<ssssss>the hotel be right next to the metro and rer - could not have ask for a better experience .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 4 3 3		problematic visit to hotel beacon i stay at hotel beacon in march during a visit to new york city.the first problem be the parking .<ssssss>while this might not have necessarily be the hotel 's fault , since i be drive in from the airport , i want to make arrangement .<ssssss>i be tell by two different associate at the hotel that nearby parking be available .<ssssss>when i find the parking garage and other by it , they be fill so i end up drive around for a hour for a spot on the street.check in be prompt and friendly .<ssssss>i go up to my room have order the wireless internet access for $ 9.95 per 24 hour .<ssssss>first the television do not work so they send someone up to fix it .<ssssss>the television be very temperamental so once the man get it work , it go out again .<ssssss>then again .<ssssss>well , i do not come to watch television , so i deal with it .<ssssss>then i try to sign on to the internet , which do not work either .<ssssss>luckily , i call the internet help desk and the problem be correct in short order.sleeping be a issue here .<ssssss>the first night , since the television be set against the headboard of the next room , i hear my neighbor watch television until 4 am .<ssssss>it be not a sound sleep .<ssssss>the next night there be a outrageous set of people in the room surround mine that be scream and slam door until 6 am .<ssssss>the hotel management do nothing .<ssssss>the hotel lobby be very nice however the room be a bit worn , with peel wallpaper and worn carpet but overall , be clean and the bathroom be quite nice and well stock .<ssssss>the room have a kitchenette with a coffee maker , refridgerator , and sink , which be nice .<ssssss>the best part of this hotel be the location - this be not in the middle of time square but in a great neighborhood with cute restaurant , store , and entertainment within a few step .<ssssss>there be even a grocery store right across the street , which be wonderful .<ssssss>the hotel be right near central park and other point of interest.overall , hotel beacon be a fairly good value for new york city and be in a great location .<ssssss>however , if you want a quiet and sound night 's sleep , this might not be the place for you .<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 5 2 5 -1		dodgy start but turn out ok ... i visit this hotel in october 2008 for 4 night .<ssssss>it be my first time to san francisco and i be travel alone .<ssssss>i have sit on tripadvisor for week beforehand as i just didnât know which hotel i should book .<ssssss>i keep reading review after review and in the end i just take a chance and book the grand hyatt , despite some of the bad reviews.i arrive at san francisco airport and get a taxi to the hotel .<ssssss>tip â?only get in yellow meter cab , which will be wait outside baggage claim .<ssssss>do not go with the driver that stand and offer they service for a fix price .<ssssss>they will rip you off and often donât have taxi licens .<ssssss>when we pull up at the hotel i pay the driver what be on the meter .<ssssss>he then say there be a extra $ 2 airport fee .<ssssss>i wasnât really think at the time and i just pay it .<ssssss>when i get out of the cab i ask the receptionist if this be right and they say no .<ssssss>you only need to pay whatâs on the meter .<ssssss>so please please please do not fool for this like i do !<ssssss>also , the driver be very surprise when i only tip he a dollar and mutter something rude in spanish .<ssssss>i donât really see the need to tip a taxi driver anyway unless they have provide a exemplary service .<ssssss>that go for everything in america and as a english person i think it be quite frankly a disgrace the way a lot of american behave with the tip system .<ssssss>i couldnât give a monkey that service be not include .<ssssss>people should only be tip if they have really earn it.anyway now on to the hotel !<ssssss>i have book a regency club king which be a high floor room with a king bed , âluxuryâ?bath amenity and access to the regency club lounge .<ssssss>oh and let not forget you be on a private floor so you have to use you key card in the elevator to access it â?this be really just for insecure people who like to look important when they be in a elevator .<ssssss>the receptionist be friendly and i be escort by the bellboy to my room .<ssssss>when i get to the room , there be two queen bed in it and like i say i have book a regency club king .<ssssss>i go back downstairs and ask what this nonsense be all about .<ssssss>i be tell that unfortunately they do not have any regency club room with king bed and that it be the only thing they could offer I .<ssssss>she try to make out that a king bed be not guarantee to which i reply â?why be you advertise something you canât produce ?<ssssss>i.e. false advertising .<ssssss>well iâm not a mug so i ask to see the manager .<ssssss>she try it on as well until i be about to leave and check-in to the westin st. franci instead â?at which point she be able to find I a king bed on a high floor with a view of the financial district which be what i want .<ssssss>it wasnât however on the regency club floor which mean i wouldnât get to use my key card in the elevator .<ssssss>big loss !<ssssss>i do however make sure that the robe and âluxuryâ?bathroom amenity be send to the room as i be still pay for a regency club room .<ssssss>by the way in case you be wonder , all room in this hotel be exactly the same .<ssssss>you just get a few extra luxury in a regency club room and access to the lounge.i enter the room and i be pretty happy overall .<ssssss>the room itself be a pretty standard hyatt room .<ssssss>you would think they would have flatscreen tv for the price you be pay and the day and age we live in but no obviously not .<ssssss>again , this didnât really bother I .<ssssss>it be only a place to stay but the room be very presentable and well decorate i think .<ssssss>there be a ipod port on the bedside table which be a nice touch and there be plenty of drawer and cupboard space .<ssssss>the bathroom be what i be always most concerned about in a hotel room but it be very clean and welcome .<ssssss>the shower pressure be good and i didnât encounter the problem of lukewarm water , which be often report on here .<ssssss>if i want boil hot water , thatâs what i get .<ssssss>this be a relief as the frequent comment about this have worry I a little.one of the reason why i also book this hotel , be because it have window that open onto a small balcony and i canât stand hotel room with window that donât open .<ssssss>i stay in a skyscraper hyatt once with no window and you just donât get any oxygen in the room .<ssssss>itâs awful if you be spray deodorant and hairspray or aftershave .<ssssss>how be you suppose to air the room ?<ssssss>the air conditioning ?!<ssssss>do I a favour .<ssssss>anyway i call the hotel before i book it to make sure that the window do open .<ssssss>i be tell by the front desk that they open to about 4 inch , and if you want they open fully you need to sign a release form as they have have a couple of suicide in the past apparently .<ssssss>this sound good except when i arrive i be tell that this be not the case anymore and hasnât be for the last year and you be only allow to have the window open to the 4 inch mark .<ssssss>this wasnât great to be honest and i be pretty annoy as i be tell something completely different .<ssssss>it also seem ridiculous to have a balcony you canât even use .<ssssss>you may think iâm a very picky person but when you be pay this sort of money , you have every right to be picky.i have a view of the skyscraper of the financial district and the view really be spectacular , especially at night with all the building light up .<ssssss>it really be wonderful and one of the great thing about this hotel be the view you get from all the room , especially on a high floor.i have pay to have breakfast each morning in the grandview restaurant on the 36th floor .<ssssss>this really be spectacular to eat breakfast and look out over the whole of san francisco .<ssssss>probably one of the highlight of the hotel .<ssssss>the breakfast itself be very good .<ssssss>it be a small buffet but not too small .<ssssss>plenty of choice .<ssssss>the âfresh , â?orange juice they offer you be clearly from a carton and i would expect freshly squeeze in a hyatt and for the price i be pay .<ssssss>they also bring you a complimentary small glass of a strawberry smoothie each morning , which for the record , be also from a carton .<ssssss>the breakfast staff be very nice .<ssssss>can be a little too talkative at time when you want to eat you breakfast in peace but i guess i should just lighten up a little.the staff overall in this hotel be absolutely superb .<ssssss>i be extremely impressed with all the staff here .<ssssss>everyone will greet you with a smile on they face , and all the staff be extremely courteous and helpful .<ssssss>this be very nice to see .<ssssss>the concierge be fabulous at this hotel and they really can not do enough for you .<ssssss>probably the best concierge i have ever come across and i travel a lot .<ssssss>this be very refreshing and extremely impressive .<ssssss>the regency club lounge be really nothing special .<ssssss>it be a small room on the 32nd floor and although the view be great , itâs not a very impressive room .<ssssss>they do a continental breakfast each morning which be ideal if you havenât pay for the breakfast in the grandview restaurant .<ssssss>the hors dâoeuvres they serve in the evening be pretty poor .<ssssss>just a small buffet area of poorly present cruditÃ©s , brocollus throw in a bowl , dumpling and a few other random bit .<ssssss>it all just look like leave over from dinner and iâm pretty sure it be .<ssssss>there be also a bar area but you do have to pay for alcoholic drink .<ssssss>all soft drink be free which be handy for I as i could get a bottle of water whenever i wanted.i do not sleep well at all in this hotel .<ssssss>at about 8 oâclock every morning there be a click noise that come from something in the room .<ssssss>it be extremely annoying and there be no way i could sleep with that noise .<ssssss>it sound as though it be the air conditioning unit cool down but i didnât ever even use the air conditioning unit .<ssssss>luckily i need to get up around that time anyway so i didnât bother complain .<ssssss>the bed themselves be not bad at all .<ssssss>they be not the most comfortable i have ever sleep in but they be definitely comfortable enough.be very careful when check out of this hotel and read through the bill very carefully !<ssssss>they will try and charge you for the minibar even if you havenât use it .<ssssss>i guess they do this just to cover themselves .<ssssss>they be very relax about take it off the bill so it be pretty obvious they do it all the time.i would probably stay somewhere else next time just to try something different .<ssssss>my experience here be good overall .<ssssss>it have its good point and bad point but i can not justify the money i pay for it .<ssssss>i think i will try the fairmont next time as it really do look spectacular and there be not much difference in the price.in term of restaurant , i wouldnât bother with the grandview restaurant for dinner .<ssssss>the food do not get great write-up and the price be absolutely insane .<ssssss>you be just pay for the view .<ssssss>if you want to see the view then pay for breakfast in there .<ssssss>wouldnât you rather say you go to a famous wolfgang puck restaurant for dinner than say you go to the hyatt for dinner ?<ssssss>trust I itâs the same price .<ssssss>avoid the local daily grill restaurant down the street .<ssssss>the hotel recommend this but my steak in there be absolutely appalling even though it be a steak restaurant .<ssssss>i go to the cardonian room restaurant which be at the top of the bank of america building -lrb- 2nd tallest building in san francisco -rrb- .<ssssss>the view be stunning and the food be ok â?very small portion .<ssssss>i like nouveau

what film they have be extra in etc , but it be all good fun .<ssssss>some great film have be film in san francisco .<ssssss>obviously do alcatraz .<ssssss>youâd be stupid to go there and not to it .<ssssss>be extremely fascinating .<ssssss>get on the boat and go across to sausalito .<ssssss>very pretty town and nice to go there for lunch .<ssssss>the golden gate bridge be one of the most spectacular thing i have ever see and if you like walk , do walk across it as the view be stunning .<ssssss>i would recommend take the hop on hop off city tour on you first day to get you bearing and

3 4 3 4 4 3 3 1		great for shopping ; dislike guest policy we stay at the europa hotel for six night between 22 february through 3 march .<ssssss>the hotel be located right on the popular puerta del sol and just across from corte , a large department store with a supermarket at the basement .<ssssss>so get food / drink be not a problem , particularly since there be also a coffee shop next to the hotel.it be worth mention that if you be unfamiliar with the area , you might have a little bit of trouble find the hotel after be drop off by the cab driver -lrb- who be most likely not able to converse in english -rrb- for a short walk .<ssssss>please note that the taxi can not stop right in front of the hotel so a little bit of walk be require .<ssssss>i would suggest that you bring a suitcase that have wheel .<ssssss>if you like shopping and crowd watching , this be definitely the hotel for you - it be also a short walk to grand via , where there be plenty of shop like zara as well as some theater .<ssssss>however , if you require peace and quiet , this be not the hotel for you , as it could get pretty loud particularly on friday and saturday night with the noise continue till dawn .<ssssss>i be disturb a little and we stay on the third floor.we also do not like the fact that we be charge 2 euro per day for the use of the safe deposit box.but the biggest minus for this hotel be its guest policy , which do not allow for any guest at any time to come up to you room .<ssssss>in fact , we have to leave we room key at the reception each and every time we leave the hotel.we have a couple of friend who be stay in another hotel at grand via come over as they want to compare the room .<ssssss>after explain the situation , we friend be allow up to see we room , but after just a couple minute , the front desk ring and demand that we guest leave the room.overall it be a ok experience , and we would stay there again simplybecause of the convenient location and the reasonable price .<ssssss>
2 3 3 4 2 2 1 -1		mediocore the grounds of the hotel be very nice .<ssssss>the hotel be enormous , and there be 2 very large pool with swim up bar .<ssssss>the hotel also have lounge chair and canope on the beach.the food be not very good .<ssssss>we do not try any of the specialty restaurant , because they do not seem to be worth the price.the service be also not very good .<ssssss>on we first full day there , we wre outdise we room from 9am-5 :30 pm with a sign on we door to make up we room .<ssssss>the room be never make up.the thing that disturb I the most be the aggressive employee constantly try to sell thing .<ssssss>one night they have a sidewalk sale , and every employee you see be grab you hand , try to pull you to he table .<ssssss>keep in mind , this be inside the hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 2 -1 3 -1		great place .<ssssss>mediocre attitude .<ssssss>we stay at the hotel from the 25th to the 30th of may , 2006 .<ssssss>well , this be we -lrb- my wife , 2 yr old baby and I -rrb- intention .<ssssss>we make the reservation 3 month ahead of time and get very good and prompt answer on the email .<ssssss>the night before arrive we post a email to remind the staff that we be come the next day late night and we get a ok .<ssssss>however , when arrive at the hotel we be tell that there be no room for tonight and we be offer a 2 star hotel for one night .<ssssss>as you may imagine , when it come after a 5 hr flight + 1 hour rer + climb up and down the stair of the saint michel station with a 30kg suitacase and a baby stroller , all at midnight , we be very disappointed from this .<ssssss>when ask why could not they ask someone else come earlier without a baby to move for the night we get no answer .<ssssss>as we have no other alternative we move for the night to the 2 star hotel .<ssssss>no one offer any help with we lagguage.when arrive next day to the hotel we find a very helpful receptionist and a very friendly kitchen staff .<ssssss>they help we find we way , sterilize we baby 's milk bottle etc. in the weekend the receptionist be change and the new one 's attitude be not as helpful as the first one .<ssssss>she sour she face for every question we have and do not bother to look on the web -lrb- she have a free one at the reception desk -rrb- for some very basic info we needed.location of the hotel be good , although it be a bit challenging with a baby stroller -lrb- as use the metro be a nightmare -rrb- .<ssssss>use the bus to go to the eiffel tower be quite cumbersome .<ssssss>go to the arch de triumph be just impossible .<ssssss>fortunately , on sunday there be the balabus -lrb- no one in the hotel know about it -rrb- that have several stop in touristic place -lrb- include arch de triumph -rrb- that make it a direct drive from st michel.windows of room be indeed noise proof but be ready to use the ac as it turn the room to be over warmed.the room be not as clean as we expect it to be -lrb- linen be not 100 % white -rrb- but in general the room be ok , even for the 3 of we -lrb- do not bring more than one suitcase , though -rrb- .<ssssss>we expect a bit more from a hotel that be rate among the top 20 hotel in paris , accord to the recommendation in trip advisor .<ssssss>we be disappoint .<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 2 -1 2 -1		a little out of touch clean , friendly , convenient location.but the blare music on friday night in the middle of the main courtyard be too much ; well i hope i do not have to pay extra for this performancestill here , and the do-tink-to be blare away on the 5 $ casio keyboard and 100000 -lrb- ok , a exageration -rrb- watt peavy amp at 11pm .<ssssss>would have give it a good review , but the put green have a single lefty putter for someone under 5ft tall ; the sailboat that you can see , you can not use .<ssssss>waitstaff have serious problem with english from time to time .<ssssss>the hot tub be kinda warm .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1		dissapoint !<ssssss>this place look great online , but very different in reality .<ssssss>we arrive 10 minute before check in time and we room be not ready .<ssssss>no problem , we grab a late lunch at the restaurant .<ssssss>service there be incredibly slow -lrb- even though we be the only people in the restaurant -rrb- and we waitress be awkward .<ssssss>the food be good when it finally arrive .<ssssss>after lunch , we room be still not ready .<ssssss>we go shopping and return later to a room that be definetly not worth the wait .<ssssss>dirty wall with scuff mark , very dirty bedspread with multiple stain , run toilet , tile floor that remind I of 1970s linoleum that seem dirty , window with blind that do not open so there really be not any window and it be very cavelike with one flurescent overhead light .<ssssss>the room be very small and sparsely furnish ... not even a clock or phone , no artwork on the wall , just a mirror .<ssssss>we check out immediately , eat the cost of one night stay and rebook elsewhere .<ssssss>it be unfortunate , because the beach and location be beautiful .<ssssss>with minimal investment in decor and attention to good housekeeping , this could be a great place , but in it be present state , we find this highly undesirable .<ssssss>

3 4 4 4 4 2 5 3		great hotel spoil by tourist trap medical facilty date of travel 25th may 2008 for 2 week , sireni tropical suites.an excellent hotel with good restaurant , good facility , very friendly staff and located right on a beautiful beach .<ssssss>unfortunately we holiday be spoil by the hotel medical facility which be a real tourist trap .<ssssss>on site doctor after a week or so my wife become ill with a high temperature .<ssssss>we go to see the on site doctor but and after a examination and a bill for $ 90 he say that he could not determine the cause and that my wife would need to go to hospital for urine and blood test .<ssssss>he say he could not do this on site and the nearest hospital be 40 minute taxi ride away .<ssssss>he even suggest we bring a change of clothing incase we have to stay overnight .<ssssss>we think it very strange that he could not perform these simple test on site and we suspect he be on a commission for any tourist he could refer .<ssssss>he be insistent throughout that we let he know which clinic we be plan to go to and he even suggest we bring a change of clothing incase we have to stay overnight .<ssssss>my wife choose not to go to hospital as although we have medical insurance we think they be bind to question the need for a hospital stay just to have basic test .<ssssss>what disappointed we the most be that after we tell the doctor my wife do not want to go to hospital he offer no treatment in order to ease she discomfort .<ssssss>i believe he be hope she condition would worsen to the extent she would feel compel to go to hospital .<ssssss>fortunately i happen to mention my wife condition to a member of staff and he be able to tell we what it be .<ssssss>they call it caribbean fever and its just a type of flu that foreigner to the island be prone to .<ssssss>we go to the onsite pharmacy and purchase some tymanol and andadin which work a treat .<ssssss>as there be malaria in dr we be worry it could be that but after look up the symptom on the internet be confident it be not .<ssssss>obviously on we return my wife go straight to she gp to confirm this .<ssssss>while we be there we hear other of other incident that reinforce we view that any medical treatment would be detrimental to you pocket .<ssssss>a friend with a ear infection be treat for a cost of Â£200 .<ssssss>while we be there we hear someone have contract gastro enteritis .<ssssss>the onsite doctor do manage to put this person on a drip , which be far more complicated than take a urine test .<ssssss>unfortunately this person do not get any better and have to spend 3 day in hospital at a cost of Â£2000 .<ssssss>i hope they be cover by they insurance .<ssssss>a rep also tell I of some other incident , i be not sure if these be sirenis specific .<ssssss>one of she guest be charge $ 500 to clear some ear wax .<ssssss>but the worst one be a woman who travel to the dr 7 month pregnant and give birth in she hotel room .<ssssss>the authority would not let the couple leave the dr until they could prove the child be theirs through dna testing .<ssssss>i suspect this be because dr have a history of child trafficking .<ssssss>this take a month and they be lucky that the hotel give they free accommodation .<ssssss>unfortunately they medical bill be 32,000 euros!if you be plan to travel to the dr make sure you have the best possible cover and do not travel if you be pregnant or have any pre-existing conditions.obviously the fact that my wife be allow to suffer needlessly for a couple day spoil the holiday to a certain extent and we would not go back to the same hotel after be treat that way .<ssssss>this be a shame as we think the rest of the hotel be excellent .<ssssss>we be fortunate that although my wife condition be very uncomfortable it be bearable .<ssssss>have the same thing happen to one of we child we would have be completely at the doctor mercy .<ssssss>roomshotel be split into two half â?cocotal beach on one side and tropical suite on the other .<ssssss>its really one hotel with two type of accommodation as all the facility be share .<ssssss>we be in the tropical suite where the room have small lounge area with a sofabe .<ssssss>useful if you have a party of three but we do not really use it much as we be a party of four in two room .<ssssss>room be nice , with two tv and a fridge which be stock with water and soft drink daily .<ssssss>we be in block m which overlook the pool and have a great seaview .<ssssss>the only thing i didnt like about the room be that the air con be very weak .<ssssss>even though we leave in on constantly it never cool the room enough .<ssssss>i dont think it be a fault as we have two room and it be the same in both .<ssssss>the room be keep very clean and fault report to reception be deal with promptly .<ssssss>while we be there the water stop a few time and we have power cut .<ssssss>there be mosquito and we get bite quite a bit .<ssssss>as well as spray yourself remember to regularly spray the bottom of you door and the air vent in the bathroom.foodi wasnt impress by the evening buffet , the choice and quality be not great .<ssssss>the staff be excellent though as they be in all the restaurant .<ssssss>very friendly , very quick to supply drink and table be keep clean .<ssssss>the a la carte be much better .<ssssss>jade and the italian be excellent i thought and a real surprise after the buffet .<ssssss>bring a camera to jade as the chef will give you some good photo opportunity .<ssssss>we try all the a carte , didnt like the vegetarian , mexican or seafood .<ssssss>steakhouse be ok .<ssssss>we try the lobster restaurant which be $ 35 a head extra .<ssssss>the lobser be huge and we be glad we go .<ssssss>lunchtime buffet be ok and there be a bbq on the beach which i though be good for snack .<ssssss>try room service one day but be disappoint to find it the same food as in the buffet even though you have to pay for it .<ssssss>i could not see the point of that.one annoyance be the booking system for the a la carte .<ssssss>basically the guest service team would lbe econonic with the truth regard availability .<ssssss>they try to get you into unpopular time by say the restaurant be fully book when it be not or they will say a particular restaurant you want be close that night and point you to the mexican .<ssssss>for example we be tell we could only go to the italian at 18:30 one night as it be fully book .<ssssss>when we leave at 19:15 there be only one other table occupy .<ssssss>on another night friend of ours be tell the steak house be close on a night that we eat there.drinksi do not drink much alcohol so i cant vouch for the alcoholic drink .<ssssss>i do notice they be use mainly unbranded drink but i think they have brand if you specifically ask .<ssssss>the non alcoholic cocktail be great , a lot better on other all inclusive i have be on .<ssssss>the other major difference i notice be that it be very easy to get serve , there be no queue at the bar , probably because it be low season .<ssssss>even at reception if you be not at the bar you would be frequently ask by waitress if you want a drink.watersportswindsurfing , kayak , snorkel equipment and catamaran be all available free for a hour a day on all inclusive .<ssssss>for some equipment you be ask to pay $ 10 a day or $ 30 a week insurance .<ssssss>other watersport such as scuba diving , parasailing and banana boat be available for a fee .<ssssss>i normally scuba dive on holiday but didnt bother as i have read the diving wasnt great .<ssssss>i have dive other caribbean island before and they be not as good as the likes of the red sea or the maldive .<ssssss>i do try sailing a catamaran for the first time and i be really glad i do .<ssssss>i be give a lesson one morning and then allow to head off on my own .<ssssss>it be a bit difficult to start as the sailing area be shallow and full of coral so you endup get grouded very easily .<ssssss>once i be more confident i go into deeper water which be more fun , especially with the wave .<ssssss>i really enjoy the sailing even though i do manage to capsize it one afternoon .<ssssss>the watersport guy be great and have a proper lifeboat to pick I up and return I to the beach .<ssssss>the watersport guy be all very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>i think that once i have capsize the catamaran once they would be hesitant to let I go on it again as it be a hard work for they to get the catamaran back but they didnt mind and encourage I to go again .<ssssss>the sailing be one of the highlight of the holiday for I .<ssssss>pooltwo big pool each with shallow and deep area and a pool bar .<ssssss>the tropical side seem to be quieter and all the activity and load music be on the cocatal side .<ssssss>we go during the low season so i would say only half the sunbed be in use at any one time .<ssssss>lot of bed be reserve under umbrella but it wasnt hard to find one especially if you go on the beach .<ssssss>as there be so many empty bed every day i think there be no chance of any squabble over bed .<ssssss>unfortunately i be prove wrong .<ssssss>we leave towel on the bed only to find a couple have decide to take the bed and dump we towel .<ssssss>i really dont like argue on holiday so i ask they to move and even though they have lose 2 of we towel which be go to cost I $ 40 to replace i didnt make a fuss .<ssssss>unfortunately later in the day the couple french daughter and husband turn up and she launch into a almighty tirade against we because we have ask she parent to move .<ssssss>she be unbelievably rude , she swear at I and my wife and even at a little english girl that happen to be watch .<ssssss>in the end i decide that a shout match be not how i want to spend my time on holiday so i wish they a pleasant holiday and move on .<ssssss>i still cant believe how i manage to get into a argument over sunbed in a half empty resort .<ssssss>locationsirenis be about a hour taxi ride from the airport in a rural location .<ssssss>apart from a hotel either side there be local shop or town to visit so apart from excursion you be pretty much tie to the hotel .<ssssss>because the road be so bad it be not recommend to hire a car either .<ssssss>local tourist sight seem to be either cave or coffee/cacao plantations.entertainmentthe entertainment be probably the best we have see on holiday .<ssssss>daytime entertainment team be excellent .<ssssss>very funny guy , especially spaghetti .<ssssss>eddie and chico be also good .<ssssss>we have child aged 10 and 13 and although there do not seem to be activity directly for they they be allow to join in most of the adult activity .<ssssss>the daytime entertainment be good fun and well organised most of the time .<ssssss>my only gripe be that the some of the entertainment team use language not suitable with child around .<ssssss>the evening show be perform in a very profession theatre with a large stage , lot of seating and good sound and light .<ssssss>i be very impressed with the quality of the dancer , they seem very professional compare to what i have see elsewhere .<ssssss>unfortunately a lot of the show be dance theme so although very good they soon lose they appeal .<ssssss>there be a few show with audience participation which although very funny again contain material not suitable with child in the audience .<ssssss>i go to the casino a couple of time .<ssssss>lot of slot and three table .<ssssss>i play black jack and it must have be a training night when i go as there be a manageress overlook the dealer and i have never see so many error in add up or pay out before .<ssssss>quite funny to watch , the manageress be livid when a dealer be go to pay out $ 70 on what should have be a $ 30 win .<ssssss>my wife and daughter have some treatment in the spa and they say they be great.there be a game room opposite the doctor which have pool , table tennis and pool table .<ssssss>you have to pay for pool but the other be free .<ssssss>open in the evening but the light above the table tennis table be so dim you can hardly see the ball.excursionsthere be plenty of choice for excursion , swim with dolphin , swim with shark and ray , helicopter ride , speed boat , zip line , trip to island , snorkel , horse ride , buggy and atv , scuba diving.after reading report on the internet we do horse ride and atv with ramone who can be find on the beach if you go left .<ssssss>a very nice man and we really enjoy the trip especially the atv 's .<ssssss>we get to ride both the horse and the atv on the beach which be great .<ssssss>my daughter be not impress with the guy that take we horse ride though.friends of ours go parasailing and they be in a group of about 8 people .<ssssss>as a result they have to spend quite a bit of time on the boat for every to have they go and a few of they be sick .<ssssss>tippingi tip a lot more than usual on this holiday and be happy to do so as the service be so good and the staff so friendly.receptionspanish be the main language but most speak enough english to get by .<ssssss>reception staff least friendly and helpful in the hotel i think .<ssssss>when we arrive we be not give any information other than where the room be and a leaflet .<ssssss>they do arrange a nice surprise for we on we wedding anniversary though free of charge shopsthere be some shop at the entrance to the hotel and some hut either side of the beach .<ssssss>the shop sell beachware , battery etc. if you walk along the beach you will be approach by local to get you to go into the beach hut .<ssssss>they be polite though and will accept a no if you be not interested .<ssssss>all the hut sell pretty much the same thing .<ssssss>on the whole they be a friendly bunch but you do have to haggle which fortunately i love .<ssssss>i go to most of the hut and my favourite be a haitian guy call emanuelle .<ssssss>he shop be the farthest shop away on the right hand side of the beach past the watersport hut .<ssssss>he be the nicest , friendliest guy of the lot and be a great haggler .<ssssss>what set he apart from the other be that if you want something he do not have he would get it for you .<ssssss>for instance i need some suitcase lock , he get they for I the next day and he do not charge the earth.weatheri be expect weather similar to florida , hot with downpour of 30-60 minute and then hot again .<ssssss>we have two or three day when it rain for all morning hour and be cool all day .<ssssss>we then have a really big storm that last a whole day after which it be really hot for the rest of the holiday.transfers we book transfer online at http://www.dominicanairporttransfers.com/ and be very pleased with the service we get .<ssssss>the website be very professional and easy to use .<ssssss>we pay $ 150 return for 4 people .<ssssss>the car be very big , clean and have good air con .<ssssss>the driver be polite , drive well and turn up on time .<ssssss>on the trip to the hotel we have a 8 seater and on the way back a 10 seater .<ssssss>the road to the hotel be full of really big pot hole so we be glad we have a sensible driver .<ssssss>other driver be drive all over the road to miss the pot hole and be go too fast for the condition .<ssssss>
2 3 2 2 3 1 1 -1		too far away from the action front desk need not exist as it appear to serve no purpose or no-one .<ssssss>room be ok , but biker like the road outside and you can not avoid the noise no matter how high you be and we be on the 22nd floor.had a serious problem with the guy who run the interlude bar and he appaling attitude .<ssssss>so bad that i report he to the manager who have a word in he ear.wouldn ' t recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
1 5 3 -1 1 -1 2 -1		for $ 84 , i should not complain ... but mouse !<ssssss>let I start by say i know i should not complain about stay at this hotel for $ 84 a night , as i find they through priceline -lrb- i never think a hotel of this caliber would be on that site ! -rrb-<ssssss>but soemthing just be not right , even at that price .<ssssss>when i arrive , there be no one to greet I and i struggle with my bag to the desk .<ssssss>i ask for a upgrade -lrb- and i be a little upset about have to lug my bag -rrb- and they put I on the gold floor ... what a treat and it make I immediately forget about my poor reception !<ssssss>the room be ok , but the lounge and the service in the lounge be great , as well as the food .<ssssss>would i spend $ 300 + a night to be on the concierge floor , the normal rate , ... no chance , would rather stay at the ritz or four season .<ssssss>it be nice , but definately not great .<ssssss>but for $ 84 a night ... it be a treat !<ssssss>the bathroom be very small and not very clean ... the hotel be just old and in need of a renovation/tlc as no one seem to care about dirty corridor , little tear and chip all over , chip bath tub and peel wallpaper .<ssssss>nothing terrible , just not crisp as you would expect on a concierge floor or at the ritz/four season .<ssssss>but , the biggest issue be that i see a mouse in the oak bar and also see a mouse in my room !<ssssss>it be awful !<ssssss>i travel very frequently to city hotel and have never see one in a hotel before !<ssssss>this would lead I to believe that they have cleanliness issue throughout the hotel and there be room service tray that stay in the corridor for quite some time .<ssssss>i guess mickey run around look for those leftovers .<ssssss>when i see the rodent in the bar , i mention it to the waitress who basically shrug she shoulder and say it be part of be in a big city ... so i guess they have these complaint before .<ssssss>would i go back ?<ssssss>no !<ssssss>not with mouse !<ssssss>but if there be no mouse and price at $ 175 - $ 200 a night , i would consider it !<ssssss>i have hear great thing about jury 's , right around the corner and will try that next time !<ssssss>
2 3 2 3 4 5 4 2		ok for budget traveler i stay at the park plaza for a conference .<ssssss>the hotel be a older property , but the facility be well-maintained .<ssssss>the lobby area be very nice and reception be always helpful.the room -lrb- 612 -rrb- be of average size with a queen bed and work desk .<ssssss>overall , the room be very clean even though the room be older .<ssssss>unfortunately , the room smell very musty on check in .<ssssss>when i turn on the a/c , it smell like it be burn .<ssssss>maintainence come right away to make some adjustment , but the burn smell never go away .<ssssss>also , the a/c be older and can not seem to keep up if you want the room very cold .<ssssss>the bathroom be on the small side , but clean -lrb- especially the shower -rrb- .<ssssss>give that i be pay $ 180 per night -lrb- which i hear be a steal in boston -rrb- , i think this hotel be adequate .<ssssss>it certainly have personality , but the musty smell might turn some traveler off .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 5 5 5 3		decent hotel at a excellent location stay for 3 night on a room face the street .<ssssss>luckily the hotel be on a quiet side street , because any shout or loud vehicle pass by be quite audible inside the room .<ssssss>the room be very basic , but clean with a comfortable bed .<ssssss>the air-conditioning work great .<ssssss>i think that the free breakfast buffet have enough variety and be plentiful .<ssssss>the hotel have one computer in the lobby guest can use to check email or look up something on the web .<ssssss>the hotel also have a music lounge and a reading lounge but do not get a chance to check out either .<ssssss>hotel be very close to palacio national and walk towards puerta del sol , there be plenty of decent and cheap food option .<ssssss>location be a 2min walk to the opera metro stop .<ssssss>since part of line 2 -lrb- red line -rrb- be close at the time we often walk to the sol metro stop to catch line 1 -lrb- blue line -rrb- for the museum .<ssssss>the walk to the sol metro be not very far maybe a 10min walk at most .<ssssss>one complaint i have be the bathroom .<ssssss>the slide glass door be not a big deal , but the entire floor would get wet every time we take a shower -lrb- no tub -rrb- .<ssssss>it get so bad that the small towel you put down the floor be soak and will not soak up anymore water ; leave the floor completely wet .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 -1 -1 -1 -1		great value and prime position .<ssssss>small twin room<ssssss>

5 5 4 5 5 3 4 3		we will be back for more ... in the room<ssssss>
1 1 3 4 2 1 1 1		heck on earth the staff be extremely unprofessional .<ssssss>the price i reserve the room for be supposedly inaccurate .<ssssss>they advertise free continental breakfast and in room coffee .<ssssss>then the try to charge we $ 5.00 per person for a pkg .<ssssss>danish and coffee .<ssssss>they wifi connectiopn be extremely poor !<ssssss>i would absolutely advise against this place !!<ssssss>
3 3 2 2 2 5 4 3		nice for a marriott , but you money can go further so you be look for a resort in phoenix , right ?<ssssss>while the jw marriott be nice , you money can go much further in this valley of the sun.overall , the marriott look good , but when you do under the surface , there be not a lot there .<ssssss>the space be big but without much character.some of the room be probably very nice , but mine -lrb- for $ 200 per night -rrb- look out on a concrete wall .<ssssss>unbelievable , yes ?<ssssss>believe it .<ssssss>at all cost , avoid odd-numbered room in the 3500 wing .<ssssss>they all look out at the same wall .<ssssss>no sun .<ssssss>no view .<ssssss>very disappointing.and then there be someone else 's hair in the sink .<ssssss>also very disappointing for a top end resort.finally , the room decor do not really fit with the desert theme .<ssssss>it be more of a french colonial thing go on.for a great experience , i would recommend the phoenician .<ssssss>
4 3 4 2 5 5 5 2		sooo cute love this place .<ssssss>i be a little wary when i first get there , however the staff , the cold drink and a snack while wait for my room help a lot .<ssssss>yes it be very date .<ssssss>i remind I of the 1950 .<ssssss>once i get into my room i be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>it be nicely furnish and exceptionally clean .<ssssss>some of the upgrade need upgrade again .<ssssss>the new finish on the old tub be peal and some water stain be show through the paint job .<ssssss>hollywood leave much to be desire thing have change a lot since i be there over 20 year ago .<ssssss>the staff be the best thing about the castle , they do everything they can to make you stay pleasant .<ssssss>do not miss the great cucumber water in the lobby .<ssssss>i have never taste anything so refreshing .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 2 4 3		another good choice from tripadvisor once again i have not go wrong in pick a hotel that be in the top 4 or 5 on this site .<ssssss>hotel jazz be fine - certainly not the best or fanciest , but the location be excellent -lrb- very close to metro stop and walk distance to p. catalunya/ramblas -rrb- ; clean room ; room be certainly larger than some europe hotel i have be in ; and very helpful and friendly night staff -lrb- note i stress night -rrb- .<ssssss>the roof deck w / pool be very nice -lrb- just wish it be open later -rrb- .<ssssss>the main complaint i have about this place be the stinginess with the toiletries .<ssssss>we have to practically beg for additional toilet paper and soap ; the maid never leave enough .<ssssss>the toilet paper be just slightly softer than sand paper and the soap be tiny and melt in 5 minute .<ssssss>we resort to use the bath gel as handsoap bc we never have enough to last .<ssssss>they also do not provide any moisturizer or hair conditioner , and only about 5 tissue per day in a tiny sealed package .<ssssss>once we see what the deal be with the toiletries , it make sense that this be only rank a 3-star hotel .<ssssss>luckily the maid leave the cart unattended in the hall a few time so we stock up .<ssssss>the breakfast be a rip off at 15 euro per person though the selection be fairly good - however , they keep run out of thing the 2 time we go bc they use the buffet to assemble the room service order !<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 2 2 1		avoid !<ssssss>arrive in the dark -lrb- 10.30 pm -rrb- straight from the airport post a transatlantic flight from london .<ssssss>from the outside , look ok , but the smell -lrb- cat 's urine or similar -rrb- hit you as soon as you step inside .<ssssss>check be be adequate ; no map or orientation offer .<ssssss>we room be on the 5th floor -lrb- there be a lift mercifully -rrb- .<ssssss>on open the door we be horrify .<ssssss>the room - supposedly a double - have enough space for a bed -lrb- a single and a half size -rrb- and about 12 space down one side , and the door open into the other side .<ssssss>the window look out onto the fire escape , which be , as a previous reviewer write , similar to a lift shaft with no roof , but no natural light etiher .<ssssss>the room smell , the sheet be dirty and everything look perhaps as it might have in the late 70 's when i suspect it be last decorate .<ssssss>bathroom ok , with good water pressure , but you do get the feeling you might come out dirtier than when you go it .<ssssss>despite be exhaust from the flight and time difference , we both have a dreadful night and be up and out by 6am .<ssssss>the room be noisy and with no air-con it be warm .<ssssss>be on the fire escape the window didnt open more than 6 inch .<ssssss>although we would book -lrb- and pay for -rrb- 3 night via expedia we leave swiftly the next day and check in to the intercontinental .<ssssss>as we check out there be no effort make to keep we there ; we be just tell the room have be pay for , so the agent care not .<ssssss>the one redeeming feature of the grant plaza be location - just a couple of block from union square , all the shopping , tram stop etc. in hindsight , think about what we pay -lrb- about Â£50 / night -rrb- it be never go to be great - but clean would have be nice .<ssssss>if you be plan on stay in san fran , it seem that you really do get what you pay for -lrb- see my review of the intercontinental -rrb-<ssssss>
4 5 4 3 5 5 5 3		nice , comfortable stay at the ic .<ssssss>we get a great price for the ic boston through hotwire and it be well worth the value !<ssssss>the hotel lobby , bar and restaurant be very nice .<ssssss>we room be very modern and stylish with beautiful wood accent throughout .<ssssss>the bed be very comfy , the soak tub be wonderful and the flat screen tv be great .<ssssss>and thank you to the ic boston for not charge for access to the gym !<ssssss>we be very happy and comfortable in we accommodations.the only negative be charge a arm and a leg for internet access .<ssssss>i couldnât believe it when i be tell that after pay a large fee for internet access in my room , i would have to pay a additional and separate fee to use the wireless connection in the lobby !!!<ssssss>also , something to be aware of - the hotel be in the heart of the business district .<ssssss>to eat at a local , neighborhood restaurant , youâll have to take a good walk , taxi or subway .<ssssss>there be nothing really right outside the front door .<ssssss>it be not a problem for we at all , it be just something to be aware of if you have never be to boston .<ssssss>
4 3 3 -1 5 -1 5 -1		sj marriott i can not disagree more with this writer .<ssssss>after stay for a week at this marriott i can do nothing but laud the worker .<ssssss>the marriott be a fun place to be before christmas .<ssssss>the decoration be unbelievable .<ssssss>the spirit be great .<ssssss>the lobby on the weekend be boom with dress up local and hotel client have a great time , listen and dance to the salsa music .<ssssss>i find it hard to understand why someone would stay so long in a hotel that they have so many problem with .<ssssss>with so many hotel around , why not pick up and go .<ssssss>as for the balcony door , they have all be replace on the upper floor .<ssssss>the hotel be old and i know this before i go .<ssssss>but it be clean , the bed be very comfortable , the water pressure be good and the people be accomodate .<ssssss>i know it be not go to be the ritz but i be pleasantly surprise after read some of the review .<ssssss>the beach be right there , which be a major thing in my opinion , yet you be right in the center of the city , albeit , a city that need quite a bit of spruce up .<ssssss>if this be the section you want to stay in , then the marriott be good .<ssssss>san juan seem to be go through a lot of construction right now and have a very unplanned atmosphere to it .<ssssss>but the people compensate for any shortcoming the structure have .<ssssss>again , after read all the review i be wonder why i even be go to pr compare to some of the other island with real luxury hotel but , hey , it have a rainforest , a 500 year old fort and of course vieque , another great experience .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1		almost wan na keep this place a secret !<ssssss>this place be a real gem .<ssssss>the elevator -lrb- yes , just one -rrb- be very slow and that be annoying , but the price , hotel staff , clean room and perfect location -lrb- 1/2 block from bourbon street -rrb- make up for that one thing .<ssssss>what a find !<ssssss>we be plan on make this hotel a part of my husband 's yearly birthday weekend celebration !<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 5 2 3 5		pretty ok .<ssssss>very nice and tidy hotel .<ssssss>the room be perfect .<ssssss>all you can imagine from a 4 * hotel .<ssssss>very clean .<ssssss>yet a little bit cold in the lobby and bar .<ssssss>welcome service be average , but professional and ok .<ssssss>wifus for free and plasma tv .<ssssss>location be just perfect .<ssssss>a little bit away from the centre bur full of interesting location close by .<ssssss>try tapaÃ§24 which be really close by .<ssssss>the best .<ssssss>and george and dragon for a beer with a friend .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 4 4 4		good location typical hyatt located in downtown phoenix with great access to museum and cultural event .<ssssss>towering , open lobby .<ssssss>staff be very nice and accommodate .<ssssss>room really need update - popcorn ceiling , 1970 's decor ; very hard mattress .<ssssss>although it cater to convention , it be a relatively quite hotel .<ssssss>aside from the outdated decor , the other major drawback be the restaurant .<ssssss>there be only one main restaurant - the compass - but it be very hard to get a reservation as it be always full .<ssssss>the bar and grill be also always full and the other restaurant -lrb- the terrace cafe -rrb- be only open for breakfast and lunch .<ssssss>there be a einstein bagel in the main lobby , but all the time we have stay at the hyatt we have have to either order room service or go next door to the westin because the two restaurant in the hyatt be full .<ssssss>

5 5 5 5 5 5 4 2		no complaint here !<ssssss>i have read a few review prior to stay at the dauphine -lrb- but after i have already make reservation -rrb- and i be a little concerned .<ssssss>however , i be 99.9 % satisfied with my stay.the location can not be beat .<ssssss>one block off bourbon street so its close enough to stumble home at the end of the night but still nice and quiet once you be ready to sleep .<ssssss>there be a great little diner -lrb- okay ... its a bit dark and tacky , especially late at night -rrb- right across the street call the deja vu , but they do offer delivery and takeout , and i highly recommend the southwestern eggroll for those late night munchies!our room be clean , nicely appoint -lrb- i mean , i have stay in sheraton and hilton that be comparable -rrb- , and the bed be unbelievably comfortable !<ssssss>the bathroom be marble and as nice as any name-brand hotel i have ever stay in -lrb- and i travel a lot on business -rrb- .<ssssss>i think the ice machine be very cute .<ssssss>they have a full size upright freezer in a closet in the hallway , and inside be little baggy of ice -lrb- maybe a half gallon in size -rrb- stack on the shelf !<ssssss>it be re-stocked every day , so we makeshift cooler -lrb- a large garbage can in we room -rrb- stay nice and full of ice !<ssssss>the only complaint i have , and it be only on one day , be the maid service .<ssssss>each day , the maid service manager would come by , knock on the door , and check to see that we room have be clean to we satisfaction .<ssssss>one day , the maid -lrb- who speak zero english -rrb- come by , clean the room , take all of we dirty towel , and leave no clean towel !<ssssss>and this be the one day the maid service manager do not stop by .<ssssss>we call down to the front desk , but the towel never come .<ssssss>we finally have to call and fuss a little , but we do finally get clean towel .<ssssss>the maid do put clean sheet on the bed each day which you do not even find in chain hotel these day .<ssssss>before this trip , i look and look for something that would tell I how the french quarter 's atomosphere be since katrina , and i could not find anything !<ssssss>so i will tell anyone who be interested that i find all the club and bar and restaurant to be just about back to normal .<ssssss>the crowd be about what i remember for january -lrb- I and my girlfriend go to new orlean every january and have for 8 year in a row now -rrb- , everything be open , and i see no effect from katrina -lrb- even in the ride to and from the airport -rrb- .<ssssss>i also feel safe in the quarter as the police be stand tall on about every third block or so.i highly recommend the dauphine !!<ssssss>it be not the ritz but for the price and location , it be perfect !<ssssss>

5 5 3 3 5 5 5 4		fantastic value for money whilst many hotel in ubud gather dust and still push they price up , saren indah focus on they service , cleanliness and maintenance better than most whilst still charge a comparatively low $ 37 per night .<ssssss>it have the homestay price and atmosphere whilst the service be on a par with the big gun .<ssssss>clean , extremely helpful and very friendly , if you have a tight budget but still want hotel treatment , this be the place for you in ubud .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 3 1 1 3		look for a other place if you like to stay at a hotel with very bad service , tasteless room and pay about 350 euro a night , please go the china world hotel .<ssssss>at first look the entrance look chique , but after 15 minute it become quite dull and all gold platter .<ssssss>we check in in this hotel , and have to bring we luggage to we room ourselves .<ssssss>this i do not mind normally so much , but we have just a lot of luggage and pay really - for china - a ridiculious amount for a night .<ssssss>the room be totally boring , and not even meet we reservation.it 's really just a business hotel , although newly decorate , it remain a very boring and tasteless place .<ssssss>people at the reception be unqualified for the job , i would say , with these prices.if you have or want to stay here , please go ahead .<ssssss>if you like to get value for you money , and have a nice stay , go somewhere else .<ssssss>i have also be to the shangrila hotel , and that be a very nice hotel .<ssssss>the same chain , but much nicer room and better service .<ssssss>that be the only other hotel i have be in beijing , so i can not recommend a other hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 2 3 4 3		good thing we be out all day ... stay at this hotel for a weekend .<ssssss>small , tiny room ; small , hard bed ; a broken fridge ; a tv with only 3 channel and no remote ; a alarm clock radio that would work only when you would press ` sleep -lrb- that be odd -rrb- ; rude maid -lrb- all other staff member be nice and even quite helpful -rrb- oh and the elevator ... i think i would have reach the 41st floor quicker if i take the stair .<ssssss>overall , i guess it be okay , i be there to relax on the beach and party so do not spend much time in the room and if it be not for the cute bell boy , i probably would have check out sooner<ssssss>
4 2 2 -1 4 -1 5 -1		perfect location but not room i have just return from 5 day at the westin .<ssssss>perfect location booking in no problem but i be show to one of the annex room .<ssssss>it be small damp there have be a water leak from the roof at some time .<ssssss>i complain be move into a much better room in the main part of the hotel .<ssssss>breakfast first class a very good pool , sauna , hot tub .<ssssss>the staff be very helpfull .<ssssss>i didnt find the bed comfortable the pillow be much too soft.in conclusion i do a internet deal at Â£100 a night for 2 with breakfast , which be reasonable after i be move to a decent room .<ssssss>its not a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>would i stop there again possibly if the deal be right .<ssssss>

2 2 4 2 4 1 1 -1		major disappointment hotel du petit moulin should not make you top 3 list when determine where to stay if you want a fabulous , hip and pampered experience in paris .<ssssss>my partner and i have plan a trip to pari for summer 2005 but have to cancel because of my work .<ssssss>to make up for it , we rebook for september 2006 and decide we be go all out to make up for lose time .<ssssss>therefore , we change the original hotel we have plan on staying and decide on hotel du petit moulin base on review from tripadvisor .<ssssss>let 's just say it be a mistake .<ssssss>first , the hotel be way off the beaten path .<ssssss>we both favor hidden gem when we travel but the service , room and experience do not make this hidden hotel a gem .<ssssss>it be not in the center of the marais as it be portray .<ssssss>nor , be the staff friendly .<ssssss>nor , be it anywhere near fabulous in regard to amenity .<ssssss>for example , every night we have to call the front desk to request the single iron and iron board in the hotel .<ssssss>second , the front desk staff have one gentleman in particular that be terribly rude to we .<ssssss>the first evening we ask he recommendation for dinner and inform he i be a vegetarian .<ssssss>we know this would be a issue prior to we arrival and have already spend a week in provence , but i have fair well so far .<ssssss>he scoff at this and say he only eat beef so he would not know .<ssssss>at that , we head out and find a big , bustling spot in the middle of the marais that have plenty of vegetarian option .<ssssss>lastly , we have also ask about head out to bar in the area .<ssssss>he inform we that they be mostly gay -lrb- which be why we want to stay in the marais in the first place ! -rrb-<ssssss>and then tell we that there be generally no problem with woman .<ssssss>this all sound good until we ask about lesbian bar and that be meet with a similar scoff from the vegetarian conversation .<ssssss>if curious , we go to amnesia which rock , have a ball and make friend with some wonderful englishmen.in that price range , we should have stay at the luxembourg parc .<ssssss>or , like we other friend do and splurge for the george v.<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 5 3 3 -1		excellent , but have fault the hotel royal magda paris be a very quaint hotel in a excellent part of paris .<ssssss>it be approx 5 min saunter to the le arc de triomphe and the famous champ elysee .<ssssss>there be some excellent bar and restaurant in the area and if you be travel from ireland through beauvais it be about â ?<ssssss>0 in a taxi to the drop off point .<ssssss>but there be one draw back to the hotel and that be one of the room be located next to a very busy restaurant / bar -lrb- room 115 -rrb- avoid this room or bring sleep tablet .<ssssss>the breakfast be over price as you will get similar if not better in a cafe close by .<ssssss>you choose sit eat a croissant look at the le arc de triomphe or a dinning room wall for twice the price .<ssssss>all in all i think if i be return i would consider stay there again take on board the comment above .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 4 4 -1		not as impressive as first thought have read the review on this hotel i decide to book it for a 3 night stay in january .<ssssss>unfortunatey my high expectation be short live .<ssssss>my girlfriend and i be place in the room next door to the 24-hour bar , reception and baggage storage and it be so small a hamster would have trouble get in .<ssssss>the bathroom be also tiny .<ssssss>as you can imagine the first night sleep be non-existant !<ssssss>i go to reception to ask if it be possible to move to another room due to the excessive noise level come from the bar .<ssssss>the member of staff be slightly bemused that i find the noise level to be troublesome .<ssssss>thankfully after plead we be give a twin room for the night and would be move to another double for the remain 2 night .<ssssss>lucky that this be the case as the constant banging and drip of the heating pipe again cause problem sleep .<ssssss>the third room be much better thankfully with it be slightly bigger include the bathroom and be on the fourth floor .<ssssss>however , i would not reccommend this hotel for couple as the excessive noise level come from group run the corridoor all night be annoying.the breakfast area can get extremely overcrowded with a lack of seat during the last hour of breakfast so i would suggest you go down as early as possible i.e. 7 or 8am .<ssssss>the hotel itself be situation in a quiet neighbourhood close to the van gough museme .<ssssss>amsterdam be a very small city and it can be walk from top to bottom in 45 minute no problem .<ssssss>the hotel be just a short stroll to the main shopping area and bar although you could take the tram if need .<ssssss>the step within and lead up to the hotel be so steep that you be almost walk vertical however , i think this be the case for most hotel due to amsterdam 's structure of house , tall and thin.in hindsight i do not have the best of experience with the hotel however , the staff be friendly and the location be really good for the price .<ssssss>if you be part of a group then this hotel would be a great choice , however , if you have kid , oap or a couple i would not stay here .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 5 5 5 2		charming inn ; ideal location i have originally book a different inn , base on tripadvisor recommendation .<ssssss>escape the other inn within a half-hour -lrb- see my other san francisco review for reason why -rrb- , after call to find out whether the petite auberge have a vacancy .<ssssss>they do .<ssssss>what a relief it be to find a place that live up to its best review .<ssssss>the decor be antique -lrb- or reproduction antique -rrb- provincial french throughout .<ssssss>room be decent-sized , very well keep , with decor that match the public area .<ssssss>staff be more than helpful.fresh-baked cookie and coffee be available in the tiny but adorable lobby , any time .<ssssss>sumptuous breakfast downstairs include quiche , ton of fresh fruit , croissant , and other delectable baked goods .<ssssss>there be a small , darling patio off the dining room but sf morning tend to be chilly so i do not see anyone take advantage of it while i be there.in the evening , wine and cheese -lrb- or other snack -rrb- be serve in the sit room and guest chat freely with one another .<ssssss>i imagine that most folk who choose a bb or small inn over a large impersonal hotel do so because they enjoy this sort of exchange with other travelers.a tiny european-style elevator serve the floor but i notice that most guest , like I , use the stair except when carry luggage .<ssssss>the tread on the stairway from the second floor to the lobby be a little narrow , possibly because they have be carpet when they be not originally intend to be , and that limit the space for you foot .<ssssss>that , and the fact that wifi be not offer free , unless you sign up for they club membership -lrb- free -rrb- , be my only complaint with a otherwise perfect little inn .<ssssss>
5 4 5 4 5 5 4 2		best bed ever !<ssssss>first the good : the most comfortable bed i have ever sleep in .<ssssss>wonderful desk staff , super convenient to both downtown and all major freeway .<ssssss>deep tub , modern swanky bathroom with frosted french door .<ssssss>the room be spotless the 3 night i stay .<ssssss>do i mention the bed ???<ssssss>now the bad : no free internet , super expensive room service , lame parking situation .<ssssss>you can not even unload you bag and check in without battle the valet guy .<ssssss>i recommend leave you car at home , or just parking once and use public trans .<ssssss>luckily everything be very close by .<ssssss>however , for the best bang for you buck , and if you have a car , try the radisson near love field .<ssssss>almost as nice , but w / free wireless , free parking and affordable room service .<ssssss>
3 4 2 2 5 4 5 2		a nice value vacation but manage you expectation the rating system be a little difficult when apply to the palace .<ssssss>some aspect would be consider 5 star , other 2 to 3 .<ssssss>we be a group of 13 , 2 family of 4 , one of 3 and a couple with no kid .<ssssss>kid range in age from 9 month to 7 years.the good stuff : the pool and beach be beautiful and the grounds be well maintain .<ssssss>combine , the 5 hotel can hold 7,000 guest .<ssssss>there be 3,000 employee .<ssssss>a amazing ratio .<ssssss>the palace be clean , clean , clean , but show sign of age .<ssssss>the staff keep you room very clean , but again the room be get tired .<ssssss>we stay in a suite , so that we could put we kid to sleep and have a place to socialize with we friend or just watch tv .<ssssss>the suite be very nice and have the best view .<ssssss>i read a review that say there be no channel in english .<ssssss>you can get 20 english channel for $ 20 for the week.the staff be very friendly .<ssssss>use bad spanish and tip go a long way .<ssssss>i bring $ 100 on one dollar bill and tip for everything .<ssssss>it be a small price to pay to get great service .<ssssss>we also generously tip the general manager upon arrival .<ssssss>when we get to we room , it only have one bed , not the two request .<ssssss>i call the gm and within 20 minute a full queen side show up with headboard , etc. he then personally call to see if we room have any other deficiency that he could take care of.the food : hit or miss .<ssssss>9 of the 12 people eat the food develop a gi problem at one time or another .<ssssss>that be a significant attrition rate , even for a third world country .<ssssss>pack you medical kit accordingly .<ssssss>i do not eat anything that come out of a steamer tray .<ssssss>you can , however , get delicious food prepare for you range from lamb to fish to steak .<ssssss>the rule of thumb be that if look bad , or taste bad , it probably be bad .<ssssss>move onto something else .<ssssss>consistency be also a problem .<ssssss>the lobster in the seafood restaurant range from inedible one night to very good another.excursions : significant bus time be require for many of the excursion .<ssssss>the diving at catalina be good , two hour each way , the four wheeler adventure be fun , a little over regulate and the equipment fairly beat up .<ssssss>bus ride 1.5 hour each way .<ssssss>the horseback ride and spelunk adventure , very good excursion â?bus ride 3 to 4 hour each way .<ssssss>santa domingo , 3 hour each way .<ssssss>the segway ride be at the hotel and a blast .<ssssss>the golf course be nice .<ssssss>green and fairway in good shape , sand trap like hit off a parking lot .<ssssss>in short , there be very little outside the grounds of the hotel complex.the clientele be very diverse with american make up the minority .<ssssss>if topless sunbathing and bathing suite that the more conservative would consider inadequate bother you , then it could be problematic .<ssssss>we find the people we meet to be gracious and interesting.in general , it be a very nice vacation , but i donât know that i would go back to this hotel .<ssssss>there be many option in the competitive all inclusive market , and we like to try new place .<ssssss>a few tweak could make the hotel truly wonderful .<ssssss>

2 2 2 3 3 3 5 3		quite the trip !!!!<ssssss>we stay there from january 14th until the january 21st .<ssssss>it be a last minute decision just to get some ray before go back to work .<ssssss>we figure for what we pay for , we should not expect too much ... staff : very very friendly and helpful , nice people and hard working .<ssssss>so tip and do not be cheap !!<ssssss>the hotel be recently take over by barcelo and compare with other barcelo hotel it do not qualify as a 4.5 star , more like a3 .5 star.amenities : well , as we get into the tropics around 1pm we room be not ready and we be advise that there be a water leak in the building .<ssssss>so for now no room with no water !!!<ssssss>we finally get the water back but it be cold most of the time .<ssssss>the 3 day of rain and heavy wind do not help much and with no hot water to take a shower thing take a pretty rough turn.rooms : tv barely work , not a big deal if you spend the day on the beach , but if the wx turn then i like to watch a show once in a while , fridge be not stock , always have to request water with the maid , bed too small for 2 people ect .<ssssss>ect ... lol :-rrb- , so if you decide to spend you honeymoon there i would suggest to think twice of go into that hotel or request a suite .<ssssss>also no work telephone and oh ... bring a ringer if you do not wan na sleep in every day.pool : 3 pool clean and plain nothing spectacular copare with other hotels.food : buffet style have 4 a la carte restaurant , in my oppinion the spanish restaurant be excellent.stay away from the mexican restaurant , you be after all in the dominican republic and if you expect real mexican food then jet over to the mayan riviera.buffet : after 2 day of buffet we already have enough ... ouch !!!<ssssss>5 more day of buffet .<ssssss>we be not picky eater and it be a bit like hit and miss some day it be very good and some day less .<ssssss>every day pizza and pasta in the italian corner ... .<ssssss>not much variety and be very much gear to north american and not much local food .<ssssss>clientele : family with kiz and tonn of elderly people.beach : white sand but it be not very shallow in front of this hotel and get deep pretty quick .<ssssss>can not compare with the maldive or the canary island but further down towards the palladium the beach get nicer and more shallow , but that be also a 30 minute walk on the beach.animations : the animation team work hard but if you be expect club med standard that be not the place to be .<ssssss>in this hotel the activity be not on time or do not exist at all even if it be advertised.shows : the animation team do also the show at night and the costume be beautiful as well as the dancing .<ssssss>but once you have see one show you have see em all .<ssssss>no variety either like karaoke ect.nightclub : be a nice layout lot of latin musicwe get what we pay for and just for a week to lay on the beach and do nothing it be ok , but i personally would not suggest this hotel nor punta cana for people who be look for the trip of a lifetime or honeymooners.spend the monney and maybe choose a different island in the carribean like turk and caico , the bahama or aruba where there be less mass tourism , smaller hotel and a bit a different clientele.ds / ck ottawa<ssssss>

1 2 2 3 4 1 1 3		disappoint in omnus i have be stay at the omnus berkshire for business every week for 9 week -lrb- we company have a preferred rate -rrb- .<ssssss>it be such a disappointment that i think i should share my experience on here .<ssssss>the biggest complaint be about the front desk service and concierge service .<ssssss>the front desk staff be unapproachable and unfriendly .<ssssss>on two different occassion they have send I up to a room that be not clean -lrb- bed not make , one smell like armpit -rrb- .<ssssss>the concierge be not very helpful .<ssssss>my colleague ask they to look up the nearest prada store and they say it be somewhere on fifth .<ssssss>no direction , no can i check the hour for you , only a its ' on fifth somewhere .<ssssss>the only friendly staff be the doorsmen -lrb- at least they smile -rrb- and the repair guy.a major issue with the hotel right now be that there be major construction right beside it .<ssssss>they start drill and bang at 8am - so do not try to sleep in !<ssssss>when you reserve or check in , ask for a room away from the construction -- this will help a little bit.the room themselves be ok , but not what you would expect from a luxury hotel .<ssssss>in some room the phone have a bad connection , the electrical socket on the lamp be break and i have have to have someone come up to fix the tv twice -lrb- a nice and friendy fellow -rrb- .<ssssss>if i have the choice , i would not stay here .<ssssss>
4 3 4 2 4 5 4 4		great hotel once you get there i travel to tokyo a lot on business and as a elite spg traveller want to try the westin purely to earn point .<ssssss>it be a very classy hotel located in the yebisu garden district.the hotel be do up in that japanese style european elegance that must have be popular during the bubble .<ssssss>service be impeccable and the hotel have recently add a westin workout facility that be top notch .<ssssss>room be nice , typical of what you would expect for a westin , and decent size .<ssssss>bathroom be marble/granite in construction and nice seperate stall shower and tub .<ssssss>and of course the room feature a exciting high tech japanese toilet .<ssssss>the hotel feature a executive lounge with cocktail in the evening and breakfast in the morning for frequent guest .<ssssss>cocktail be generous with full bar and nice selection of appetizer .<ssssss>the breakfast be also generous and fill with amusing option such as green salad -lrb- for breakfast ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the westin staff have learn a bit about western taste since i be last at the property and be now serve crispy bacon alongside the limp traditional offering.the yebisu garden complex provide a lot of dine option -lrb- so you be not limit to the $ 150 sushi sampler on the room service menu -rrb- as well as shopping and international atm at a post office branch .<ssssss>i eat at a traditional tonkatsu location -lrb- japanese fried pork that taste a bit like weiner schnitzel -rrb- and at a yakiniku -lrb- japanese style korean bbq -rrb- restaurant , but the option be vary and offer option in a variety of price ranges.so ... what be not to like ?<ssssss>unfortunately the one major drawback to the westin be its location .<ssssss>the ebisu subway station be a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel through the yebisu garden complex , and ebisu be not necessarily close to traditional tokyo business district .<ssssss>check into this consideration when book you stay as at the end of a long business day or sightseeing venture this could be a drawback .<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		food poisoning -- march 1-8th , 2006 my husband and i stay at the bavaro princess the first week of march 2006 .<ssssss>to qualify my statement , i have travel and stay in resort in the follow location : mazatlan , puerta vallarta , cancun , jamaica , cuba , and costa rica prior to this trip.pool : nice , big and lot of shade to get out of the sunbeach : one of the nicest i have ever step foot on .<ssssss>we walk for mile along the beach each day and people watch other walk by .<ssssss>bavaro have lot of chair available but you have to be up at the crack of dawn if you want a big umbrella thingy to sit under .<ssssss>people reserve then with beach towel and do not come back until mid-late morning .<ssssss>this usually happen at all resorts.grounds : this property be beautifully manicure and well keep but huge .<ssssss>tram come around quite frequently so this be not a big deal!service : poor .<ssssss>poor .<ssssss>poor .<ssssss>no one want to help with anything .<ssssss>for example ... the front desk forget to give we a lock for the safe so we call and ask that one be bring to we .<ssssss>we want to lock we valuable up .<ssssss>they tell we that we would have to come all the way back to the front desk to get the lock and that one would not be available until the next day.good luck on get a drink if you do not have a dollar bill in you hand .<ssssss>the bartender scan the bar for money and skip over everyone who be not show the cash .<ssssss>and they will serve people that walk up beside you after you have be wait for 10 minute , if they have a dollar in they hands.room : spacious suite be well keep and clean .<ssssss>food and drink : poor ... .<ssssss>i do not go with high expectation for food , but i be still disappointed .<ssssss>the best food i find be at the beach bar and find myself have a hamburger and fries every day .<ssssss>the food be generally bland and everything be luke warm , regardless of whether it be suppose to be hot or cold.my husband and i both get food poision we second last night when we eat at bella pasta .<ssssss>we both have the beef carpaccio as a appetizer and different main course so there be the link .<ssssss>my husband wake up in the middle of the night and puke he gut out the next 24 hour along with hot and cold spell .<ssssss>and we both suffer from severe stomach cramping and ` the run ' for the follow 10 days.we only drink bottled water and even brush we tooth with bottled , so we know it be not from the water.we find the drink to be water down -lrb- not a huge deal -rrb- , but the cocktail be sooooo sweet that we could not drink they .<ssssss>stick to highball and beer if you do not want you tooth to rot and fall out.overall : i would recommend travel to punta cana to everyone , but not this resort because of the poor food , drink and service .<ssssss>this be a 3-star resort in 5-star clothing !<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 1 2 2		good location , not very much else we have stay here occasionally for many year .<ssssss>the main reason we go back be the location , which be very good.problems : reservation be often lose or incorrect .<ssssss>both check-in and check-out be usually very slow .<ssssss>it frequently take a hour to check in , even with very few other guest at the desk .<ssssss>unload can be a hassle , since there be often no where to park , even for a few minute , let alone a hour .<ssssss>the last time we be there it take a hour and a half to check out .<ssssss>there be a line of guest that go from the desk all the way back into the courtyard .<ssssss>seem like every person in the line be complain about they room or the service .<ssssss>on the subject of rooms-sometime -lrb- like this last time -rrb- we have get a nice room .<ssssss>but it be not at all unusual to get a room with a toilet that do not work , a broken window , a door lock that jam , a bad smell , etc. it be also common -lrb- almost to be expect -rrb- that they try to charge more than the amount quote when the reservation be make .<ssssss>frequently the room that be reserve be not available .<ssssss>it can take a long time to get you car -lrb- valet parking -rrb- even if you let they know well in advance when you want it .<ssssss>we find out after leave that we car have a ding in the side .<ssssss>
4 4 4 3 4 2 5 4		a nice change of pace a group of friend and i who travel to new york annually to reunite , relax , and see a show or two decide to forego we usual dig in midtown/time square and camp out at the ritz carlton battery park .<ssssss>we book club level room -lrb- only one of we room get upgrade to bay view after the first night -rrb- through american express platinum travel .<ssssss>we be very pleased with the service , food presentation , and accomodation on that floor .<ssssss>yes , there be the carpet stain here or there and no in-room coffee as discuss by previous reviewer , but all in all , compare to other crackerbox nyc room , this one be just fine .<ssssss>the view , once we be move to a bayside view , be fantastic .<ssssss>the staff throughout the hotel be genuinely kind and greet we at every chance possible .<ssssss>we also have two child -lrb- 7 and 10 -rrb- with we on this trip in one of the room , and at no time do the staff treat we differently .<ssssss>i have one issue with the front desk staff not handle we check-in correctly .<ssssss>i specifically call several day ahead and give explicit instruction regard not charge my friend who be to check in earlier than I -lrb- it be a birthday surprise -rrb- .<ssssss>i be tell that it would be take care of and no problem in typical ritz fashion .<ssssss>although they completely flubb this up , my stay from that point on be nice enough that i let it slide .<ssssss>the location be out of the way if you be new to the city and want to concentrate on the midtown and uptown touristy thing .<ssssss>if you be not scare of train and taxi to get up that way , i would definitely recommend this ritz carlton .<ssssss>oh , and ask for raquel if you be on the club level .<ssssss>she be the epitomy of ritz carlton 's commitment to service .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 2 -1 5 -1		bathroom in 3 different room reek of urine we just return from we trip to tokyo for we honeymoon and think that we should offer we opinion on the very popular park hotel .<ssssss>we choose this hotel because of all the good review on tripadvisor .<ssssss>unfortunately , we be not as please by we visit .<ssssss>first and foremost , i must admit that the hotel staff be wonderful .<ssssss>they be incredibly helpful , and they speak english very well.that say , there be certainly a few concern that will prevent we from ever return to this hotel .<ssssss>the hotel room be tiny , even by tokyo standard .<ssssss>but that be not we main dilemma .<ssssss>we biggest complaint be that the bathroom smell very strongly of urine !<ssssss>although the room look clean , the bathroom always smell bad .<ssssss>we think perhaps this be a fluke , so we move into another room .<ssssss>the bathroom smell of urine there too .<ssssss>in fact , we stay in 3 different room at this hotel and find that they all have stinky bathroom .<ssssss>we be very unhappy.otherwise , the hotel be in a very convenient location with access to both the japan railway and the subway .<ssssss>the hotel lounge offer live jazz on some day of the week , which be also very nice .<ssssss>if not for the horrible smell of the bathroom , i would have give this hotel a better review .<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 4 2 -1 -1		if you be not particular my husband and i stay in this hotel for one night only because we flight be early the next morning.we arrive just around check in time and as it be a warm and humid day we ask if the room would have air conditioning .<ssssss>we have read the other review here.the room we have order -lrb- airport view -rrb- apparently do not because the room they send we to be view nothing but the hotel back yard .<ssssss>no mention at check in though.since i have to while away a few hour on my own when my husband drop we car off with he parent i would really have like to watch the planes.also , the room charge be higher because of air conditioning.but , that be the least problem.we have ton of luggage as we be go away for over 3 week and there be no luggage cart visible and no help be offer to we .<ssssss>still , they put we in the room furthest away from the elevator.when i look around the room , i notice the window be crack .<ssssss>there be no draft , but this still be not so great .<ssssss>the air conditioner work , but be so noisy we have to turn it off at night .<ssssss>see i could not see plane i decide to watch some tv .<ssssss>nothing .<ssssss>just grey .<ssssss>i check the tv and the cable tv cord have be unplugged .<ssssss>so i have to move that tv around a lot to insert the cord .<ssssss>the blanket provide be really , really thick and we be really hot in those bed over night .<ssssss>the toilet flush have to be press down hard otherwise it do not flush alright.the shower be break also .<ssssss>when i step in only a lame little water trickle leave the shower head so i change the shower head to the stronger shower , but the water just leak out of the back side of the shower head , with no more strength than the other .<ssssss>the window curtain have a big rip in it .<ssssss>with all those negative , there be also a few nice thing : the one comfy chair be really comfy .<ssssss>the bed be pretty comfortable also .<ssssss>they provide a hair and body shampoo in squeezable container in the shower and near the sink .<ssssss>i think that be quite good for the environment , but if you do not bring you own lotion you will have none .<ssssss>no shower cap either.we could check we luggage in at night so i be on my own with 3 suitcase .<ssssss>again , no help .<ssssss>the lady at the front desk ask if i go again the next morning and let I ride the airport bus shuttle for free that night.when we check out next morning and complain about all those thing we still have to pay for the airport shuttle .<ssssss>-lrb- 5 euro per person -rrb- .<ssssss>with so many problem that should have be the least they could have give we .<ssssss>we never try they big breakfast , but tea and coffee with croissant and nutella and jam and butter be quite enough , especially as you get a lot of food on you flight usually.next time we be fly out early we will try another hotel in the area , especially as there be a few you can walk to from the terminal instead of pay extra money for a shuttle bus .<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 2 3 2 2		nice hotel but not stellar this stay be definitely fine as i would expect from a westin but not exactly heavenly as i have come to expect from the brand .<ssssss>the common area be dirty and unkempt .<ssssss>the room be nice and stylish but a lamp do not work .<ssssss>the hotel charge you a high price for absolutely any request such as extra glass or corkscrew , which i have never experience even at lower-end hotel .<ssssss>i hope that this be not become more common at the westin brand hotel .<ssssss>

1 1 1 2 1 3 1 3		this be a shocker we have book to stay for several night at the end of we holiday.arriving to find most of reception be renovate , and far from the luxury room that we have book , the linen be not clean , the bathroom be a mess , and there be stain on the ceiling - this be a room in need of a makeover.breakfast be a small offering , serve on plastic plate with stale roll .<ssssss>not a pleasure.the neighborhood be also suspect after dark - we do not venture out , but there do not appear to be anything in the way of decent food in the area.we check out after one night and move downtown , pleased to have escaped.the only excuse to stay here be if you be visit relative study at uw - apart from that forget it , you will not enjoy the experience<ssssss>
1 1 4 3 4 1 2 4		you think you trip there be bad !<ssssss>the first evening at the paradise , sept 20/08 , the marble floor on the stair lead to the room be extremely wet , so i slip even though i try my best not too and break two toe .<ssssss>the room fridge be not work so i call for 3 day and finally it barely work thereafter .<ssssss>no remote for the tv be give .<ssssss>have to take the trolley to the main reception area or beach most of the time .<ssssss>the boat bar be only open for one night -lrb- friday -rrb- .<ssssss>other than that you have to go to the main bar at the reception because the other -lrb- pool bar -rrb- close at 6:00 pm .<ssssss>the casino be like something from a vegas ghost town from the 50 's so do not think you can win anything there .<ssssss>the food be only comperable to cuban food , which you would expect in cuba .<ssssss>the reception staff be unbelievably rude and i have never see so many tourist complain about various inconvenience in all of my .<ssssss>they even go so far as to say to they guest that they be liar .<ssssss>i tip the maid $ 10.00 the first morning but the service be terrible .<ssssss>i also tip every day thereafter a couple of dollar and choclate and still never even get towel , not once be they replace without complaint .<ssssss>i finally go and steal about 10 towel from the cart and hide they in the room .<ssssss>i do not need rise pedal on the sink , i need towel !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>the only staff i find nice be the bartender and the waiter , but they be also tip very well .<ssssss>night before checkout , i want to book the room for 3 hour extra due to the flight time .<ssssss>i be tell to come back at 9 the next morning , go back at 9 , tell to come back again at 9:30 .<ssssss>they tell I that be fine and it would cost $ 10.00 per hour , no problem .<ssssss>3 time i have to go back with the trolley for a card that would work , but still do not .<ssssss>find some staff person there and he open the door for I , seriously i think anyone who work there have a pass card to you room .<ssssss>this happen earlier when i lock myself out .<ssssss>so i finally take a shower and do not some male staff member decide to let himself in while i be in the damn shower .<ssssss>i yell every swear word imaginable and he finally leave .<ssssss>still do not know why he be there .<ssssss>the manager of hotel call a few minute later and ask what i be do there - can you believe it .<ssssss>other than the pool and the beach , do not go .<ssssss>you can not even go outside the compound unless its a tour , unless you do not like you jewerly .<ssssss>then at the airport they charge I $ 50.00 overweight , problem be , i do not buy anything while i be there , they actually want $ 70.00 canadian .<ssssss>the only thing i can figure be the clothes be damp and weigh more or the scale be fix .<ssssss>as i say , i have never see anyone complain so much at a hotel as i do there .<ssssss>p : for the lady , the male staff be like roach , they never leave you alone .<ssssss>also lock up anything valuable or else .<ssssss>better still , do not go.i would take cuba any day of the week , its safe there and the people be honest and the town be safe.good luck , dc toronto , ontario<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 3 4 2		great location we have a romantic weekend in new orlean , and the hotel be great .<ssssss>the room be a little on the small side , as be the bathroom , but we do not mind .<ssssss>the pool be great , just what we need after a hot day explore the city .<ssssss>only downside be the neighbor next to we enjoy they weed on a regular basis , so the hall sometimes reek !<ssssss>
2 3 2 4 2 4 3 2		smelly room pro : good location , free parking , very friendly reception staff who give we lot of tip and advice on public transport and be very helpful with all question we had.cons : we room -lrb- it be room 113 , so you can avoid it -rrb- stank of urine ; it get a little better once we activate ventilation and the air conditioner , but a/c be automatically switch off once you leave the room so it do not help much .<ssssss>the room be very small as well and it be not perfectly clean .<ssssss>there be rubbish leave from a previous guest in the trash bin.there be free internet access from a computer in the lobby , but it be almost always occupy since there be only one for such a big hotel .<ssssss>for sydney , it be however probably one of the hotel with reasonable prices.one last advice would be to avoid the airport shuttle which the hotel can book for you .<ssssss>when we be pick up , we be drive to another hotel and have to wait there for another vehicle for quite a time .<ssssss>it take much longer than we be tell .<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 5 3 3 4		bed not great here i stay 4 night at this hotel 14 -18 november on recommendation from tripadvisor .<ssssss>this hotel be fine generally , clean room , although some of the furnishings be get a little worn -lrb- e.g. wear desk edge ; crack and flake plaster come loose from bathroom ceiling , not great -rrb- .<ssssss>however my main complaint be the bed - they be wobbly/saggy - not the standard of firm , luxuriant bed -lrb- e.g.westin -rrb- you would expect of a hotel of this cool , minimalist profile - and not what you would expect of a hotel that charge 180 euro plus per night .<ssssss>i sleep on floor 2 of the night as i could not bear the lack of support in the bed .<ssssss>this do not add to the pleasure of you holiday .<ssssss>also the hotel generally lack any warmth or character - a anonymous experience ; staff do not give you much , it be all a bit sterile .<ssssss>generally the hotel be fine if you like peace and quiet -lrb- it be very quiet - 7th floor in any event -rrb- but not if you appreciate a really good bed .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 4 3 1		surround by drunk ... spend a week here on a timeshare exchange and have stay at other marriott ` resort ' so i know what to expect .<ssssss>the old building be nice to look at ; a distinctive hallmark in financial district of boston and a great location overall from which to walk all over town .<ssssss>central location both good and bad as what be near in addition to the harbor , aquarium , and shopping be noisy , obese tourist , and horde of buffoonish local , typically see either smoking and/or eating , many in various stage of inebriation , -lrb- much worse at night -rrb- , wear celtics/red sox apparel , with shave head and multiple tattoo .<ssssss>local male be just as offensive in appearance .<ssssss>the room at the custom house be large but with typically cheap marriott furnishings and amenity .<ssssss>for example , there be no glass in the bathroom and the shampoo/soap be decidedly downscale .<ssssss>gym on 25th floor be adequate and that term just about describe the entire experience .<ssssss>activity at the property be typically outsource and do not expect to get anything useful without pay for it , e.g. , no free internet access , overprice continental breakfast offering , exorbitant valet parking charge , only mcpaper for morning reading , and limited housekeeping service .<ssssss>you can , however , watch old movie and free tv in a ` special ' lounge .<ssssss>staff very helpful and amiable overall .<ssssss>be i not able to trade for this space i would never pay what room cost at retail , upward of 400.00 per night .<ssssss>for those plan to visit and stay in boston there be probably many more comfortable hotel -lrb- hilton financial district be one i would recommend -rrb- but the downside be that you will still be in boston .<ssssss>go yankee !!!<ssssss>
3 2 5 4 5 3 2 2		overrate and overprice my husband and i stay here during a month-long trip all over the u.s. honestly , we be underwhelm .<ssssss>on the postive , the bed be amazingly comfortable and we get the best night 's sleep of we trip .<ssssss>the view from the room be great , as be the location in sf.however , we have have better service at budget hotel .<ssssss>on we first night at the hyatt , we go down to the lobby bar for some drink and appetizer .<ssssss>the bar be very quiet - there be only a few table occupy .<ssssss>despite the fact that it be slow , and the fact that there be 5 -lrb- yes , 5 -rrb- server work at the time , it take 15 minute for someone to come and take we order .<ssssss>then , it take another 20 minute for the waitress to bring we we drink .<ssssss>when we look up to see what be take so long , we see all the server and bartender standing around talk .<ssssss>we food come about 40 minute after we order it .<ssssss>nobody offer we any explanation of why thing be take so long.my husband work in the restaurant and hotel industry , so we be very understand with waitstaff when we go out .<ssssss>but this be ridiculous - the service be absolutely appalling .<ssssss>on top of all that , it cost $ 50 per day to park we car at the hotel , and another $ 10 per day to use the internet .<ssssss>i understand that the parking rate be pretty typical for a upscale hotel in the city , but why be they charge for internet ???<ssssss>i can go to a la quinta and get it for free !!<ssssss>as lovely as the accommodation be , the inflated cost of this hotel be not justified due to the below average customer service .<ssssss>
4 5 5 3 4 2 5 -1		good food , good room let down by housekeeping i book 2 room for the hoxton as part of they introductory deal and have 2 room for less than the price of one travelodge .<ssssss>food in the hotel be very good with a impressive steak sandwich -lrb- steak melt in the mouth -rrb- burger and omlette .<ssssss>gt 's be well mixed .<ssssss>the downside be that whilst the check in be 14:00 -lrb- we be give one room early at 12:00 -rrb- the other room be not ready even after finish lunch at 15:00 .<ssssss>the staff whilst helpful be at housekeeping mercy of try to get the room ready for 15:30 -lrb- not good when you have a late matinee performance to make -rrb- .<ssssss>i will say that after contact the hotel directly i be happy with the resolution to this complaint and so can not fault them.room - great to have fresh milk for tea , the bed be comfy and quirky decor .<ssssss>shower be great and another nice touch be a real bar of pear soap -lrb- rather than those matchbox size one that disappear very quickly -rrb- .<ssssss>overall a good hotel , yes it be slightly out on london but do not use the tube where you see note but a darkened tunnel - hop on the bus and see the sight of london it only take 10 min .<ssssss>food be good and the serve staff be excellent and extremely efficient.a good stay and whilst this would not be the top hotel in term of location , it offer good quality standard and once housekeeping keep on top of the room turnaround time it will be a great hotel .<ssssss>hoxton be not chelsea , however this be real london with some interesting night spot around .<ssssss>give it a go as we all too often only stay in the tourist trap area 's and don ; t discover real life .<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		good place for a ` home base ' for a san francisco visit if you be go to visit san francisco for to visit the tourist attraction , this be a great place .<ssssss>the breakfast be soooo yummy , and the tour pick you right up from the hotel .<ssssss>-lrb- just avoid the one-day yosemite tour - it be horrible ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the room be clean although small .<ssssss>the staff be very nice and helpful .<ssssss>if you have time , the winery/muir wood tour be great .<ssssss>the restaurant next door be good for diner food , but definately venture to chinatown and other area of sf to eat .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 2 2 3		beautiful place the hotel be just beautiful , the entire complex be huge and include a water park and a funicular to go from one part of the hotel to the other .<ssssss>i stay at las olas wing and la marina village in two different occasion , if you be look for have some quite and romantic time i will recommend these wing of the hotel .<ssssss>the pool nearby the la vista wing and las brisas wing tend to get pretty crowd .<ssssss>the beach at palomino be beautiful , with crystal clear water and have a few good spot for snorkle .<ssssss>however , if you want to get a feeling of the island and its culture , this place be not suitable .<ssssss>it have all the amenity of the typical american 4-5 star hotel and do not reflect the puerto rican culture .<ssssss>also , be ready to spend big buck , the price for food , etc. be outrageous .<ssssss>
1 2 2 -1 5 -1 2 -1		chancellor be a disappointment my husband and i stay at the chancellor for four day in june and would give it mixed review .<ssssss>yes , the location be great right at union square , but the hotel lobby need renovation badly and the bed be uncomfortable .<ssssss>the room be quite clean , but they either face busy union square or a huge bank of air conditioner that do not turn off until 11 or after .<ssssss>because the weather be unusually warm , we be quite uncomfortable since the hotel itself do not have air conditioning and have to request a move which be quieter and cooler in a corner room .<ssssss>wifus be spotty to non-existant in we room and to make matter worse we be refuse a aaa discount when we check out because we have sign a paper when we arrive .<ssssss>the staff seem uninspired but they do accomodate we move graciously and generally be helpful , especially with the wifus .<ssssss>the restaurant serve a good breakfast and give service with a smile .<ssssss>
1 1 4 3 4 1 1 -1		5 star price , half star service the place be clean and beautiful , but the service be unbelievably bad .<ssssss>on the first day , we room be not ready 'til 5:30 pm .<ssssss>while we be wait for the room , we wait a hour and 20 minute for 2 hamburger at the pool side restaurant .<ssssss>they do not let you bring any of you own food in , but all of they restaurant have awful food , worse service and ridiculous price .<ssssss>$ 9 bottle of water anyone ?<ssssss>-lrb- from the mini bar -rrb- .<ssssss>i strongly suspect the calamari in the asian fusion restaurant be really fry rubber band .<ssssss>the sampler platter , which be suppose to include grilled chicken , beef , shrimp and eggplant , be a plate of chicken with two bite of beef , and the waiter could not care less when they screw up .<ssssss>the staff zoom around the property day and night in very loud , gasoline power golf cart , so it always sound like a parade of lawn mower .<ssssss>they charge we $ 70 to pick we up from the airport and $ 85 to drop we in old san juan -lrb- a 20 minute ride -rrb- .<ssssss>the ice machine be always empty and they be always out of towel .<ssssss>even the car rental desk charge twice what the rest of puerto rico do .<ssssss>gran melia also make extra money by let non guest pay to use the pool , so the place be crawl with kid during the day .<ssssss>we really feel like they go to great length to squeeze every last dollar out of we , but make no effort at all to deliver even passable service .<ssssss>we travel a lot and do not mind pay for something nice , but this place charge 5 star price and give you half star service .<ssssss>they nearly ruin we honeymoon .<ssssss>puerto rico be great , but stay away from gran melia !<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 2 4 4 3		great location , just remember it be a one-star hotel the best thing about the hotel lloret be its location right at the top of the rambla , near plaza catalunya .<ssssss>this put you right between the barri gotic and l'eixample , and right next to a major metro stop .<ssssss>other positive include the friendly and helpful staff and the bathroom , which look recently renovate .<ssssss>also , the room price be relatively low for barcelona.however , it be important to keep in mind that the lloret be a one star hotel , and just a average one at that .<ssssss>here be the negative base on my recent trip there -lrb- i stay 3 night -rrb- : - while the room be clean for the most part , there be a stain on my bedsheet and i do see a roach in we room the second night .<ssssss>that could have be a fluke , but it be never fun to have bug in you room .<ssssss>- i be on the 2nd floor off carrer taller -lrb- a side street -rrb- and even with the window close it be very noisy .<ssssss>i rarely have trouble fall asleep at night but i do here .<ssssss>bring earplug !<ssssss>- skip the breakfast .<ssssss>it be bread with jam and butter and pastry from a box .<ssssss>coffee from a machine , which be okay .<ssssss>you can get better for less at just about any cafe .<ssssss>if i go to barcelona again , i will probably spend a little more to stay somewhere nicer .<ssssss>however , if you be look for something cheap but nicer than a hostal , the lloret be okay , and the location really can not be beat .<ssssss>

4 5 4 4 3 1 1 -1		lovely hotel/annoying staff with attitude we book we room by deal directly with the hotel .<ssssss>email be prompt and courteous .<ssssss>what we be not tell be that this hotel have two building -- the lovely original building feature in the website and the newer facility across the street , which be not the least bit charming or appealing and the room be much smaller .<ssssss>when the three of we arrive -- my husband and i be travel with we teenage daugther -- the bellman begin take we across the street , base on the instruction of the woman work at reception who do not even speak to we .<ssssss>upon see what be basically a closet for three people , we insist on see what be available in the older building .<ssssss>we be take to a lovely room that be not huge but certainly spacious enough for the three of we , with a classy marble bathroom that have plenty of room and two shower .<ssssss>we be tell that they have be try to do we a favor by cram we into the afore mention closet as they would be work on the elevator in the old building during we stay and do not want to inconvenience we .<ssssss>we take the larger room and what do you know ?<ssssss>there be nothing at all wrong with the elevator and they for some reason have make up a ridiculous story to attempt to stick we in the inferior accomodation .<ssssss>perhaps it be because we have book early and have a great rate ... who know .<ssssss>but it be the height of rudeness and disrespect .<ssssss>the staff remain consistently aloof and though they do in fact speak some english , they certainly do not go out of they way to be helpful at any time .<ssssss>we be very independent when we travel and do most of we sightseeing on we own or through tour that we book privately ... so they indifference do not matter to we , but if you be come here and think the concierge will be of assistance , you will be disappoint .<ssssss>otherwise , the hotel be clean and comfortable with a great breakfast and reasonable rate for barcelona .<ssssss>the location may be a plus or a minus depend on how you look at it .<ssssss>it be situate on what you might call barcelona 's upper east side ... about a ten minute walk from las ramblas and the old city .<ssssss>we love the location as it be close enough the the craziness , but far enough away to escape the carnival atmosphere if you want to .<ssssss>great restaurant within walk distance and a half a block from casa battlo , the amazing home design by gaudus for a private client .<ssssss>so many travel agent put client at the waterfront .<ssssss>it be a long hike into the center of town from there and unless you be plan to actually sit on the beach , it be really out in left field .<ssssss>certainly worth a visit for lunch and a stroll .<ssssss>we favorite restaurant be casa calvet , another gaudi building turn into a restaurant .<ssssss>exquisite surroundings and food to match .<ssssss>even we 18 year old swooned.stay at the conde for lovely accomodation at really reasonable rate , great shopping and access to all the sight ... just be sure to insist on the old building and do not expect anybody that work there to give you the time of day .<ssssss>
3 3 2 2 5 2 3 4		ok but much better on offer !<ssssss>the hotel itself be very clean and efficient .<ssssss>typical with most hotel it be very expensive to most local restaurant and bar .<ssssss>one of we evening meal for two cost over Â£100 and we only have a bottle of wine and one other drink .<ssssss>the staff be friendly except the majority of the reception staff who could not be bother to do anything other than they direct duty .<ssssss>they have a shuttle bus which take you into town which be excellent cause you be quite a bit of out .<ssssss>we have pay extra for a harbour view room but wish we have keep the cash .<ssssss>we simply get a view of water between tall building .<ssssss>the room be tiny and very cramp but we have expect this as the city be so build up .<ssssss>the bar be tiny but again the staff be excellent and always make sure you be serve .<ssssss>my one major complaint would be that the hotel have nothing oriental about it .<ssssss>it be a modern hotel which could be anywhere .<ssssss>the pool be very cold and the view from it be not what be in the picture .<ssssss>i enjoy my experience in the hotel but they be much nicer out they .<ssssss>the continental and the penninsula be very grand and have the best view in my opinion.hong kong itself be fantastic - one of my favourite destination .<ssssss>
1 1 3 1 2 3 -1 -1		stay away at all cost i stay here with my husband and another couple for new year ' 2006 , but i be just get around to write this review now .<ssssss>i wish i have read a review like this when research for a spot , would have be a god send to skip this place .<ssssss>yes , the resort be physically attractive , nice grounds , room , etc , but it be too huge , there be a trolley to take people back and forth from restaurant , room , beach , etc. and the room be nice too , but that be where the compliment end .<ssssss>first , there be no service , it be non-existent , you ask for towel or for anything , no one show up until 4 hour later if they show up at all .<ssssss>next , mgmt suck , if you ask for a mgr or supervisor to discuss a problem or issue , they say not available or the mgr be just as useless as the person behind the counter .<ssssss>and do not try grease any palm for better service , we try and they just take the money and do not do anything for we .<ssssss>next , the buffet be disgusting , almost inedible .<ssssss>then there be like 10 restaurant with different cuisine , all need reservation , but you can only reserve that morning for the same night , so unless you wake up at 7a , you get lock out of the only 2 good resto .<ssssss>the beach sand be like a ashtray , and the water brown and murky .<ssssss>you be bascially stuff in this strange , cheesy all-inclusive world where the only thing to do be drink sugary cocktail .<ssssss>the pool scene be full of fat american and they loud , fat child .<ssssss>i be pretty lay back and up for anything , but this place totally disappointed .<ssssss>i would never return , and i think will never do all-inclusive again , anywhere .<ssssss>the dr be such a beautiful island , it be a shame to waste you time and money on this crappy place .<ssssss>
2 3 2 -1 1 -1 3 -1		muy muy dissapointing !<ssssss>there be some good point to this hotel and some bad : the good be that the location be fab !<ssssss>if you get the airport link bus it drop you off two minuet away !<ssssss>it be right in the centre of the city so you can walk anywhere .<ssssss>it also have balcony on the room ours look over the side street and be great for people watch , we even see a parade from it !<ssssss>the city be great must see segrada familia , casa balato and the cathedral v. near hotel -lrb- remeber to take a cover up for shoulder and leg -rrb- .<ssssss>also the hard rock cafe be great esp for teenager who love music , though go in early as you have to wait for you table.now on to the bad dun dun dun !<ssssss>... the bathroom be nasty there be hair from previous guest all over the floor , the mother do not like it !<ssssss>on we floor lobby , flower be in a make shift vase a water bottle !!<ssssss>the hotel be very smoky also .<ssssss>it be dissapointing because the lobby ect look great in the photo .<ssssss>also there can be some noise from outside and the bin man come very early.las rambla can become nasty after a few day , the restarant that line it con you into litre glass of drink which cost a small fortune although they be fun before you realise the price .<ssssss>i recomend resaurant down sidestreet which have more charcter and be more relxed.i have also hear horror story of bag stealer on las ramblas esp ppl who come on scooter and grab it , so keep a tight hold !<ssssss>****** on the plus though , on the street with the wax measuemum there be one of the best pub in barcelona !<ssssss>it be theme like a enchanted forest with a run waterfall , tree oo it be soo much fun and very cool which be great in the heat - you shld go there it be fab !<ssssss>******* also the waffle near the beach be good , also the market have great fruit which be good for a cheap lunch .<ssssss>barcelona be a great city - enjoy yourself and i hope my opinion be not completely usless .<ssssss>!<ssssss>adio<ssssss>
2 1 1 5 1 1 1 1		crazy experience they authorize my card next day for the restaurant bill of $ 372 , even though we have split the tab by 4 .<ssssss>i do not want to talk about the service nor the half baked bouncer at they club , as the only thing that nice about they be the food and the chef.looks like the whole hotel staff include the restaurant manager need to be send on training to europe at a michellin 1 star restaurant .<ssssss>it be hollywood blvd , waiter and server be wannabe actor who do not have passion to serve , but be worry about they next audition .<ssssss>
4 2 3 -1 5 -1 5 -1		good but not great just return from spend 8 night here at the hyatt .<ssssss>i visit honolulu at least once a year and normally stay at less expensive hotel .<ssssss>this time i decide to go on the spur of the moment and the hyatt be the only hotel available .<ssssss>i choose a deluxe oceanfront room since i be splurge this time .<ssssss>i really expect something spectacular .<ssssss>the room on the 35th floor be nice and very clean but small -- especially the bathroom .<ssssss>the view be incredible .<ssssss>definitely beware of hidden charge .<ssssss>most of the cheapie hotel i stay in over there have a microwave , fridge , coffeemaker , etc. in-room coffee cost $ 1.50 for one cup .<ssssss>we pay $ 12 to rent a fridge .<ssssss>the staff be wonderful throughout the hotel .<ssssss>the food be good .<ssssss>we eat breakfast every morning at the terrace grill.the worst thing about the hotel be the ridiculous size of the pool .<ssssss>it really be about the size of a really nice home pool .<ssssss>for a hotel as large as the hyatt , this be a mystery .<ssssss>the chair be very comfy and the pool service be wonderful , but by 10 be the pool be full of squeal children.the huge waterfall be gorgeous , but it be almost impossible to find somewhere to sit to enjoy the view .<ssssss>we finally find a few padded chair .<ssssss>most of the lobby furniture be extremely uncomfortable .<ssssss>i would stay here again , but if i want to go upscale or high moderate , i would definitely prefer the sheraton or the royal .<ssssss>in fact , as far as pool and amenity go , i even prefer the outrigger reef !!!!<ssssss>
4 4 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		good location we stay there for 4 night last winter .<ssssss>great location !<ssssss>clean and nice room with fair price .<ssssss>but the drawback be they rude staff .<ssssss>they be mean and not helpful at all .<ssssss>we book the hotel from expedia .<ssssss>the website say there be a travel agent onsite but this be not true .<ssssss>you need to go across the street to find it .<ssssss>but book some package to visit some nearby old town really worth the money !<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 3 -1 -1 -1		enjoy waikiki but construction noise annoy we have a multi island vacation with we first hotel the outrigger on the reef .<ssssss>i feel it be well worth the price of the room , however , be very disappointed in the construction go on across the street from we .<ssssss>i could not sleep with the lanai door open because the banging start early .<ssssss>i be aware of the noise at the pool , in the room , at the restaurant .<ssssss>it really take away from the polynesian atmosphere .<ssssss>breakfast at the chief hut for 4.99 be fine , but we find 2 local place on kuhio rd. about 3 block away with breakfast for under $ 3 -lrb- the tsunami -lrb- and you call it drink on monday for $ 3 ! -rrb-<ssssss>plus , because of all the business 's in waikikus , you can always find happy hour and early bird special so dinner and drink be very affordable .<ssssss>-lrb- so dont limit yourselve to the resort -rrb- i be please with the room because of all the closet !<ssssss>we have 4 !<ssssss>plus a frig , iron , etc. the shower be very big , however , the tile , vanity etc be peel off some kind of coating they have put on probably year ago .<ssssss>but we room be always very clean .<ssssss>the beach be practically non exsistent , but if you go to the north , there be a very nice big public beach .<ssssss>and of course , waikiki beach , crowd , but fun watch the surfer and great for people watch .<ssssss>the army museum next door we find interesting and do not even have enuf time to get thru it all .<ssssss>do not bother wait for the bus to go to hananama bay , you will wait forever .<ssssss>deal with the limo or taxi driver who will ask the people wait at the bus stop if they want a ride .<ssssss>several go by and offer to share the ride in the limo with other tourist for $ 5 .<ssssss>the bus be $ 2 and save about a hour wait be worth the extra $ 3 plus stand room only on the bus to hanauma bay.don ' t miss the snorkeling , it be unbelivable !<ssssss>do the same for diamond head .<ssssss>we bargain we ride down to $ 3 with a taxi driver.this be not a luxury resort , but if it be not for the construction i would definitely stay there again .<ssssss>
4 3 2 5 4 5 4 4		good enough reader may wish to know that i be a diamond card holder with the hilton group -lrb- which give I upgrade -rrb- .<ssssss>furthermore my wife and i be fairly well travel and neither of we will see 50 year old again.this hotel be more of a businessperson 's rest place than a traveller 's .<ssssss>the bedroom be small and any more than 1 suitcase become a problem in term of hang space and space in the room for case storage .<ssssss>the bathroom be , for I , bizarre : build of frosted glass it afford no privacy or discretion , but the shower cubicle be great .<ssssss>sound insulation to the outside of the bedroom be not brilliant , and you will hear door slam.the hotel be well located in one of the main city centre road and be close to most thing .<ssssss>the outstanding victoria shopping centre be immediately opposite , darling harbour be a 10 minute walk and circular quay , the botanical garden and the opera house about a 20 minute walk .<ssssss>the hotel have a really good , large gym and spa with regular class for man and woman , include a dedicated spinning room .<ssssss>the breakfast room be good with a reasonably good variety of food .<ssssss>zeta 's bar be a magnet for the young , and saturday night be quite simply a parade of beautiful girl in refined clothing wait to pay aus 40 just to get in.the executive club room be ok , but get very crowd at happy hour time and the food variety be boring.the general service level be high -lrb- but not in a hong kong way -rrb- and the concierge desk be well managed.would i stay there again ?<ssssss>difficult to beat the location , but i would want more bedoom space and a discreet loo !!<ssssss>
5 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		great hotel and excellent staff have a absolutely wonderful time last week at the fairmont .<ssssss>we room -lrb- the smallest suite -rrb- be just lovely and the amenity be all that we expect in a hotel of its type .<ssssss>and the architecture in the grand entrance be just beautiful.but what really make a impression on we be the staff .<ssssss>when we arrive at 3:30 we room be not yet ready -- as sometimes happen in a busy hotel .<ssssss>we have all we bag with we and must have look pretty frazzle after 12 hour of travel .<ssssss>the desk clerk walk we over the bar and order we two drink on the house while we wait .<ssssss>maybe 30 minute later we room be ready -- but we be no longer feel so anxious to get to it as we feel we vacation have finally begin .<ssssss>for the next few day the fairmont treated we like we stay in seattle be as important to they as it be to we .<ssssss>highly recommend the seattle fairmont and plan to stay there again .<ssssss>
2 2 3 3 4 1 1 4		a dissapointing experience base on the review here , my husband and i book this hotel for a week .<ssssss>we first impression of the hotel be that it be lovely , but in a rather remote area of town .<ssssss>we be fine with that , and be excite to be near the harbor and beach .<ssssss>we impression of the hotel be immediately lower when we speak with the reception staff .<ssssss>very rude , no hello or welcome glass of cava , just Â¨do you have a reservation ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>they certainly be not child-friendly .<ssssss>they honestly look horrify that my two year old son be with we .<ssssss>they scowl at he every time we walk through the lobby .<ssssss>Â¨the first night we be there we ask if there be a quick restaurant in the area that serve simple , child-friendly food .<ssssss>we son be tired and hungry and we just want to crash .<ssssss>reception suggest that we eat in the hotel restaurant , but we want something a bit faster and less fancy .<ssssss>reception be able to name two 4 star restaurant within a 15 minute walk , but the only simple restaurant that they could name be a 20 minute cab ride .<ssssss>we choose a direction , and begin to walk , and within 5 miute be able to find a perfecty fine place that serve pizza .<ssssss>my son be happy.the room be fine , nothing special , although after a week in paris it seem especially spacious .<ssssss>there be some small thing wrong , like loose bathroom fixture and a slightly leak sink , but we never call maintenance.the rooftop pool be nice -lrb- no kid , which i understand -rrb- and would have be nice to use at night , swim in view of the barcelona light , but it close at 6 .<ssssss>overall , this hotel seem uneven .<ssssss>sit in the lobby , i see other couple check in that recieve very warm welcome from the manager and several glass of complimentary cava .<ssssss>maybe they be as cold as they be because of the child ?<ssssss>they really should take a cue from many other 4 and 5 star hotel , who will at least pretend to be welcome to child .<ssssss>overall , definately not worth the $ 180 a night we pay .<ssssss>there be seveal otther hotel in barcelona , that be similar in quality that run no more than 100 euro a night .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 4 4 4 1		hotel review nice 3 star hotel .<ssssss>room be good size and everything be clean and well keep .<ssssss>breakfast be good with a good selection of option .<ssssss>the location be excellent - very central .<ssssss>broadband access in the room be extortionately price at â ?<ssssss>2 for a day .<ssssss>when be hotel go to realise that this should be free - it do not cost a huge amount for they to put in place a wireless router that cover the whole building so the marginal cost of provide access for guest be minimal.i still find it very hard to get use to the fact that people smoke in the bar and in the hall .<ssssss>the netherland need to put in place the same ban on smoking in the workplace that exist throughout many european country .<ssssss>the absence of the smoking ban would stop I return there on a personal trip -lrb- business this time -rrb- .<ssssss>
5 3 5 4 5 4 5 3		fantastic hotel and facility .<ssssss>by the beach<ssssss>
1 1 3 5 3 1 1 -1		** a true nightmare -- do not stay here if you want peace do not stay at this hotel if you want peace quiet !<ssssss>-lrb- or if you have child -rrb- we be unable to sleep for several night because the wall be very thin ... could here we neighbor both upstairs and downstairs -lrb- one night they be fight and the police be call ! -rrb-<ssssss>and ... there be party at the hotel pool that last until all hour of the night .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we room be literally vibrate from the music , even though we be on a high floor .<ssssss>the staff at the front desk be rude and not apologetic -- management reduce we room rate for a few night , but it do not make up for we stressful stay and lack of sleep.stay at the ritz or intercontinental instead -- all be on the same beach have similar rate depend on when you travel<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 5 3 3 3		nice location we stop over in singapore at the beginning of we honeymoon , and we travel agent recommend that we take the singapore airline stopover package , and we pick the gallery from the brochure of hotel we be give to select from .<ssssss>we pick the gallery because it look a bit different from you average hotel - both on the outside and in term of some of the theme room -lrb- which be not part of we package -rrb- .<ssssss>when we arrive , we find it to be a nice enough hotel , but really , nothing special .<ssssss>we be warn by we travel agent that a double bed be not guarantee , and that we might have to have twin bed - but we do not anticipate that there would be no possible way of push the bed together , as they be attach to the bedhead , and with a bedside table in between - nice start to the honeymoon !<ssssss>we ask if we could move to a room that have a double bed since it be we honeymoon , but be not lucky enough to be upgrade like other lucky reviewer - we could only move on payment of a extra $ 75 per night .<ssssss>to be fair to the hotel , this be they policy , and it be really we travel agent who should have tell we that there be no possibility of a double bed !!<ssssss>there be nothing really wrong about the gallery , but really , if you be in the cheaper room like we be , you be just in another hotel.it be great be near the clark quay area , a area i have not visit before .<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 3 2 2 -1		nice resort , staff rude nice hotel , nice beach , food be ample and in most case a good variety , taste good .<ssssss>al carte retaurant be good and easy to get into .<ssssss>the front check in counter be as state by other in you review as a bit of a problem very disorganized.staff in the bar area and pool area and maid be sometimes rude .<ssssss>the entertainment be excellent and we have no problem with we room we overlook the ocean and we could sit out on we balcony and watch the entertainment every night .<ssssss>bring plenty of small american money as you have a hard time get change at the hotel .<ssssss>
1 3 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		like fawlty tower from the moment we arrive -lrb- when no-one bother to take we bag from the taxi -rrb- to the moment we leave , there be nothing but hassles.our booking -lrb- make 3 month prior -rrb- be incorrect as they have we stay for one night not two , and then tell we we would have to move room during we stay.despite breakfast be inclusive , it be place on we bill -lrb- despite check with reception and with the restaurant -rrb- we be overcharge in the bar , and when this be point out , be tell nothing could be do about it !!!<ssssss>-lrb- they soon get the message -rrb- .<ssssss>staff seem totally inept.even checkout take 20 minute due to a long queue at the reception desk.complaints fall on deaf ears.nice hotel , great location , dreadful service<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 3 2 1		shabby room hotel gioia be situate close to all the site .<ssssss>we get there late and i would think that we end up with probably the worst room in the hotel even though we advise they of a late check-in .<ssssss>the room be very shabby .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny -lrb- phone box size -rrb- .<ssssss>the view be of the damp dark central opening of the building with a bad smell from the kitchen drain , hence we leave the window close and the curtain draw .<ssssss>it be the worst hotel that we stay in during we stay in italy .<ssssss>car parking be a problem in central florence and next time if we have a rental car i will book a better quality hotel for the price that be situate a little further out of the city but close to one of the bus route .<ssssss>only for we get there late we would have move hotel .<ssssss>we get up before 7am and get a lovely breakfast in one of the nearby square .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 2 2 1		great location we stay here one night on starpoint and the hotel location be the best .<ssssss>right in the center of union square .<ssssss>the hotel itself smell a little old and it be a little dark too .<ssssss>we arrive at 10:30 am and the front desk manage to let we check in early , which be a plus .<ssssss>we be in the historical building and we be on the 4th floor .<ssssss>we room totally look onto union square and there be no obstruction .<ssssss>i have some issue with the hotel staff with help I with direction and use the internet cost a min .<ssssss>of $ 10 -lrb- what a joke -rrb- .<ssssss>the location be great , but not the best hotel .<ssssss>we room be nice , but fall apart -lrb- ceiling be crack , knob on furniture miss and no pen in the room -rrb- .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 1 1 1 1		never again apart from the location , i have nothing good to say about this hotel and i be surprised the number of people who rate it so well.it 's the only hotel that we book through we travel agent and never again .<ssssss>we spend 4 week in italy , and i book all of the hotel through the hotel website after research they on trip adviser - they be all fantastic.anyway , the pittus palace .<ssssss>we initially stay for one night , and we room be dirty , dark and feel unclean .<ssssss>there be no power point , the lighting be too dark and the carpet be filthy .<ssssss>needless to say that i do not sleep at all that night.first thing in the morning , i emailed we travel agent and ask she to relocate we in another hotel as we be head off on we walk tour and return to the pittus palace a week later.unfortunately , there be a big fashion event in florence the weekend of 18 june and all of the hotel be book out .<ssssss>in addition , the hotel require 7 day notice for any cancellation .<ssssss>the hotel that i book directly only require 24 hour notice.eventually , the travel agent manage to upgrade we to another room for a additional 50 euro a night .<ssssss>this room be much cleaner and we have no other option but to accept it.the staff at reception on both of we stay be rude and indifferent and too busy surf the internet to acknowledge you when you walk past reception.on the day of we arrival -lrb- 1st stay -rrb- a english couple who be check out , leave they luggage with the hotel while they do some last minute thing .<ssssss>on arrive back at the hotel , they find that the cash that they leave in they bag have disappear .<ssssss>the hotel maintain that a tourist have walk in off the street and take the money .<ssssss>let 's assume that this do happen !!<ssssss>i still can not accept that this hotel do not think that it be appropriate to ensure that the bag be secure in a area that be not easily accessible by the public .<ssssss>

2 2 2 3 2 3 4 4		mediocre i have stay here twice , first in june ' 06 , and again in jan ' 07 .<ssssss>while this review be specifically for the jan '07 stay , both stay be comparable , fri + sit night , and both be at a nightly rate of $ 55 via a opaque , prepaid , online booking service -lrb- i name my own price -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel 's own website state : please note the hotel will be undergo renovation from nov. 1 , 2006 until mar. 30 , 2007 .<ssssss>my advice be : do not pay rack rate here until after renovation be complete!on the upside , the room be well-furnished , with two double bed , attractive wall covering , tv , iron board and steam iron , free wireless wire internet -lrb- more important than tv ! -rrb-<ssssss>, a small desk , and adequate lighting .<ssssss>there be nice soap and shampoo/conditioner/lotion in the bathroom , along with clean towel , washcloth , and a coffee maker .<ssssss>as note by other , the elevator be functional and fast .<ssssss>climate control in the room be adequate .<ssssss>i also appreciate ceramic coffee mug and glass tumbler -lrb- rather than plastic -rrb- .<ssssss>and there be a sliding-door closet , with hangar and plenty of storage for luggage , etc. i be annoy that there be not a luggage rack , however.on the downside ... the bathroom ceiling be absolutely filthy with mould and peel plaster , the grout be mouldy , and the floor stain .<ssssss>i will stop there , because as note by the many flyer , the hotel be undergo renovation to replace all guest bathroom from the stud out .<ssssss>the worn carpeting and shabby drapery be also set to be replace .<ssssss>i can only hope that the hard and uncomfortable mattress will be replace too .<ssssss>as note by other , the room face the hospital do experience siren and road noise all night long , and i do not think the renovation will fix that .<ssssss>and renovate the tiny bathroom will not make they any larger.i have little interaction with the desk clerk ; however , i be please that my advance phone call at 10 pm the day of check in be sufficient for they to hold my room until my very late arrival of 12:30 am .<ssssss>-lrb- prepaid booking be sometimes cancel with no refund if you do not check in before midnight of the arrival date .<ssssss>fortunately that do not happen to I . -rrb-<ssssss>aside from the item note above which will be rectify by renovation , my stay be satsifactory , and the price be terrific .<ssssss>the outdoor pool be close .<ssssss>other seem to be enjoy the restaurant , though i eat elsewhere .<ssssss>there be not a lot of late-night dining in the immediate vicinity of the hotel , other than a pizzeria .<ssssss>there seem to be a security guard out-and-about , so i always feel safe .<ssssss>yes , there be a red line t subway station about two block away ; the hotel have no self-parking and the adjacent garage charge $ 36/day with no in/out .<ssssss>-lrb- so if you be go to park , use the hotel 's valet parking , which be the same price but allow in/out -rrb- .<ssssss>there be no on-street parking available .<ssssss>i would stay at this hotel again , though i would really want to find a cheaper parking option .<ssssss>i be sure that after the renovation , this will be a much more attractive property .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 1 3 1 1		very disappointing we recently spend 10 night -lrb- feb 20-mar 2 -rrb- at the majestic colonial resort .<ssssss>we travel agent warn we but we look at the review on this website and be mislead .<ssssss>this be the list of the problem that we unfortunately encounter during we stay : - arrive at the resort on feb 20 and my wife become ill the next evening after arrive , accidentally mess up the room with vomit and we call housekeeping for room cleaning service , be promise to clean up soon , but housekeeping never show up on that day .<ssssss>the room be not clean until the next day .<ssssss>- housekeeping frequently use a single full-size sheet to make the king-size bed .<ssssss>because the full size sheet be so much shorter than the king-size bed itself , there be about a foot of the mattress expose without any sheet some day there be two bottom sheet to fully cover the bed other day just one leave the mattress partially uncovered .<ssssss>another result of housekeeping try to use a single full-size sheet to cover the mattress be that by morning the sheet would be fully un-tucked from the mattress .<ssssss>- resort have no mattress pad for the bed which make we feel so uncomfortable without it .<ssssss>- not enough towel and shampoo , body gel ... sometimes .<ssssss>housekeeping be very inconsistent in replace these critical bath item .<ssssss>- the 2 glass provide for mouth rise lay up side down on sink counter be not change daily after use a few time they be noticeably dirty .<ssssss>- noisy toilet run water none stop from time to time by itself , and we have to stop it by shake the handle in order for it to stop .<ssssss>- shower door would not close completely .<ssssss>you have to be careful to keep the entire bathroom floor from get all wet and become very slippery to walk on .<ssssss>- room do not get clean on wed , feb , 28 , so no available clean towel for that day .<ssssss>we have to go down the hall to get towel from the maid 's cart , and be promise by she for the room to be clean later that day , but room do not get clean .<ssssss>- because the room have very limited supply of toiletry and do not get clean the day before , so there be not a supply of toilet paper , we totally out of toilet paper .<ssssss>again we have to chase down the maid for a roll of toilet paper after use the last available paper in the room .<ssssss>- my husband have a gross experience share real cloth hand towel in public bathroom of the gourmet restaurant with hundred of other man in the resort !<ssssss>he end up have diarrhea the next day too .<ssssss>so we be not sure because of this dirt public hand towel or the food or could possibly both .<ssssss>- shortage of electric power at least half dozen time for few minute every time it be out while we be there for the 10 night -lrb- have to eat in the dark or whatever we be do -rrb- .<ssssss>also , every time the power go out the a/c have to be reset so if we be not in the room at the time it become very stuffy and smell damp .<ssssss>- light be so dim in the room , so neither my husband or i could easily read we bible and we have to wait for brighter sunlight up in the morning , so we could stick we bible in stand position by the patio door to read every morning .<ssssss>- sometimes we could watch cnn or movie , and sometimes we could not watch it at all as a notice pop up cover the tv screen for a unpaid bill for satellite service .<ssssss>- low quality food be use for guest such as broccoli be not fresh and often look be cut off on tip of flower and it look more yellow than green .<ssssss>- i order 2 appetizer in chinese without plan to have any dessert or soup , so i could have enough food to eat , and be question by the waiter because he try to stop I from order 2 appetizer .<ssssss>the waiter insist that we order 1 appetizer , 1 soup , 1 entrÃ©e and 1 dessert .<ssssss>for this reason , we feel we could not freely eat as much as we like or whatever we like , even though it be suppose to be a all inclusive resort .<ssssss>any deviation from the normal menu -lrb- extra appetizer , extra entree or no soup -rrb- throw the service completely off result in longer than normal wait or failure to serve what be order .<ssssss>- we do not have enough bottle water in we room , so we decide to get more from the bar to bring back to we room for the evening , but when the maid see more than 4 bottle of water in the room the next day , she never stock we anymore than 4 for we as we need .<ssssss>we have to hide they from she in order for she to stock more for we consumption .<ssssss>even though water be all we drink , but hardly anything else .<ssssss>other than all these problem that we have , one thing we appreciate the most be the entertainment .<ssssss>it be really good and funny .<ssssss>best of all the animation staff start everything very punctual on the program they provide and not change the program either like other resort often do .<ssssss>so it seem more guest participate in it and it be more fun .<ssssss>that be we appreciate and enjoy a lot .<ssssss>so this become the best part of we trip !<ssssss>as you see with this negative experience that we have during the 10 night we be in majestic colonial resort , we feel that the resort do not provide a adequate service the way it should to reflect as 4.5 star resort that we be promise with such as clean room and good food and drink , tv service ... that we pay for .<ssssss>i would rate it closer to 2.5 star .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 4 2 -1		a disappointing stay we love the ritz-carlton hotel ... we have stay in orlando twice this year , st thoma and new york a few time .<ssssss>i be start to wonder if the central park location be either too busy or just do not care anymore.last night we go to dinner ... -lrb- we be out of we room by 5pm -rrb- and return at 9:30 .<ssssss>when we walk into we room , we realize that turn down and towel service have not occur .<ssssss>it be very disappointing .<ssssss>we call the front desk and ask if they change they policy on turn down service , they reply that they have till 10pm to complete that service .<ssssss>i be not sure that answer we question and be not typical of ritz-carlton hotel .<ssssss>we then ask for towel in order to shower in the morning -lrb- there be only 2 upon we arrival -rrb- ... after wait over half and hour -lrb- we be get tired and want to sleep -rrb- we call again and the front desk say she send they up and she have no idea what happen .<ssssss>do that sound like ritz-carlton to you ?<ssssss>after a call back by the front desk a woman bring towel to we room and tell we of she woe on how busy she be and they just could not get to we room tonight .<ssssss>i can get that kind of response at any hotel ... not at $ 700 a night.needless to say , i be very disappopinted in the service .<ssssss>no one apologize or show any remorse for inconvience we at 10pm on a saturday night .<ssssss>i be use to a different ritz-carlton .<ssssss>it be too bad .<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 3 3 3 1		nice but limited stay here while visit amsterdam in the summer .<ssssss>the couple who run the place be quite nice -lrb- she more than he -rrb- , and it be probably a excellent choice if you do not require some of the more basic hotel amenity -lrb- i.e. , granola type will love it , 4 season type will run for the door -rrb- .<ssssss>nice , basic room without a/c and small , functional bathroom .<ssssss>one caveat , due to the proximity to the red light district , you may run into the periodic drunken lout rant about manu .<ssssss>

2 3 2 5 2 3 4 -1		you get what you pay for !<ssssss>i book this stay through the rydge website , as i have stay with rydge around the country before i think it would be of the same standard .<ssssss>the receptionist on duty when check in be tire , the room and bathroom could have do with a really good clean .<ssssss>the only good thing be that the bed be clean and linen be fresh .<ssssss>no laundry facility within the hotel be also a inconvenience to a business traveller .<ssssss>defenitly not a hotel for young family .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 1 1 5		lovely hotel , awful front desk staff this be a wonderful hotel .<ssssss>the location be perfect for the french quarter , and the courtyard be a gem .<ssssss>you can sit next to a burbling fountain in comfortable chair and have a take-out drink from next door and enjoy the flower .<ssssss>the room be mostly very , very nice , and there be a lot of variation -lrb- some be newly renovate with flat screen tv , expose beam and brick , and antique ; some be very small ; etc -rrb- .<ssssss>the price be excellent.the problem with the hotel be the front desk staff .<ssssss>they take no responsibility for anything beyond check people in and out , and there be noone else on duty most of the time .<ssssss>i recently stay for a week and immediately see that i need to change room -lrb- for very valid reason -rrb- .<ssssss>i ask to do this and be treat like i be completely unreasonable .<ssssss>the woman at the front desk lie to she manager and say i have be scream at she .<ssssss>the experience be extremely unpleasant .<ssssss>i finally be able to move only because i stake out the cleaning staff and find a empty clean room which i then request -lrb- the front desk staff have be claim for day that it be impossible to find I a room -rrb- .<ssssss>every time i be in the lobby i hear the front desk staff -lrb- several different people over the week -rrb- complain about the guest .<ssssss>they complain to I , each other , and other guest .<ssssss>they seem to hate the guest , and they wrongly accuse guest of be rude to they on a regular basis .<ssssss>the only way i can see that many employee behave so consistently badly be that the management have encourage this behavior .<ssssss>it be a real shame because otherwise this be a great hotel .<ssssss>but beware : it be very upset to be the butt of so much animosity .<ssssss>here 's another example : there be heavy rain one evening and the drain in the courtyard plug up , result in 6 of water .<ssssss>there be no way to get out of the hotel without wade through it .<ssssss>after we wade through we get to the lobby , only to have the woman there berate we about a man who have just yell at she about the water .<ssssss>she keep say , what do he think i be suppose to do about it ?<ssssss>we have just get thoroughly soak ourselves , and then have to endure this abuse .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 4 3 3 -1		excellent area but watch out for room 101 !<ssssss>we arrive at this hotel on easter friday when it be pour with rain and the temperature be much below the average in florence at this time of year .<ssssss>we one hope be that we would get to we cosy hotel room and warm up but unfortunately this be not the case .<ssssss>for a two-star it be what you would expect , small , boxy and basic : small reception , quiet and unassuming concierge who speak good english .<ssssss>it be one distinct advantage be the beautiful and spacious roof terrace .<ssssss>however , we room -lrb- room 101 -rrb- be on the first floor next door to the kitchen and cupboard and also right next door to the tv room and dining area .<ssssss>this mean that we be adjacent to the booming tv next door and be wake at 5am by staff set up for breakfast and all sort of slamming of door , staff walk around , and talk .<ssssss>you would think that they would be conscious of guest in that room but they be not - this room should not really even be a guest room as it be freezing cold -lrb- heating come on at 3pm -rrb- do not have proper curtain or shutter and carry all the noise on the first floor .<ssssss>however , when we ask to change room , the staff be accommodate and accept it with indifference .<ssssss>we pack we bag and they move they for we to a room on the 4th floor .<ssssss>it be certainly warmer and have proper shutter , but the bathroom be a toilet/shower combination .<ssssss>again , this be a 2 star so really that be not bad .<ssssss>i be impressed to find all room have good hair dryer and provide extra blanket although the towel be questionable so bring you own!overall , it be not a bad hotel especially for those who do not plan to spend a great deal of time in door and it be in a excellent location , just avoid room 101 !<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 3 3 1 -1		timeshare by anyother name would still smell we just return from 10 day at the ocean blue resort in punta cana .<ssssss>overall it be a nice vacation but there be a few thing that really bother we .<ssssss>first and foremost be the welcome tour we be invite to attend we first morning at the resort .<ssssss>we be tell to wait for breakfast because they would serve a very special breakfast to we while they explain all the feature the resort have to offer .<ssssss>breakfast be a glass of orange juice while they encourage we to become member of the h-10 family .<ssssss>for just under $ 40,000 we would get 3 week of vacation at any h-10 property -lrb- a extra $ 52 - $ 108 per person per day for all-inclusive -rrb- for the next 25 year .<ssssss>they claim it be not a timeshare , but sure sound like one to I .<ssssss>they tell we that there be different color wristband for guest and staff know who the family member be and they get the best service and accomodation .<ssssss>i know the service we recieve be by far rhe worst we have ever get at any resort , but i be not sure if it be the color of we wristband , or just a very poorly train staff .<ssssss>besides the service , the food be bland and unimaginative and often bear little resemblance to the menu discription .<ssssss>it be not horrible , just not that great .<ssssss>they have two resturant for member only , but of course for a price -lrb- about $ 30 per person -rrb- other can dine there .<ssssss>origanally we be go to try the seafood resturant -lrb- which be a few picnic table on the beach -rrb- for my husband birthday , but feel that it would be a major waste of money .<ssssss>nothing we eat at any of the other 5 resturant indicate that they have chef there that could prepare food worth pay extra for .<ssssss>if you do not mind be repeatedly hassele about timeshare presentation and do not care about quality of food or service it be a nice place .<ssssss>the setting be beautiful and the beach be one of the nicest on the coast .<ssssss>lot of activity offer , rock climb wall on the beach and a bungy trampoline .<ssssss>they have a bowling alley , disco , casino , bike ride , tennis , achery , dance lesson , etc. lot to do !<ssssss>they also have a sport bar that my husband really enjoy .<ssssss>he could go in at night and watch espn -lrb- in spanish of course -rrb- to keep track of he favorite team .<ssssss>next door to the sport bar be a coffee shop that serve hot and cold coffee and tea that i really enjoy .<ssssss>as i say at the outset , it be a nice vacation and if it be not for the pressure to become a family member -lrb- they would approach you on the beach and on the way out of breakfast to try and get you to come to another meeting -rrb- , i could have forgive the poor service and bland food .<ssssss>i pay for a relaxing vacation and do not appreciate they take my time to try and pressure I into buy into they idea of family .<ssssss>i know they have openn some new resort in the riviera maya , so if you be think of visit any h-10 property beware of the welcome tour .<ssssss>

3 5 3 4 3 2 3 3		great for the price stay here from the 15th to the 18th of june 2007 .<ssssss>i quite like the location so easy to get to the leidseplein and central station via the number 2 tram stop be almost outside .<ssssss>also a easy walk through the vondal park to leidseplein though a bit of a trek if you want to walk to central or dam square but do-able .<ssssss>the room be fine a bit small and not much storage but clean and perfectly comfortable .<ssssss>some of the reception staff be a bit miserable but nothing too bad.managed to get up for breakfast twice which be ok but a bit basic.overall a great base to explore amsterdam in a nice area .<ssssss>
4 4 5 4 5 3 2 4		great value the hotel be well located , 10 minute walk to tianamen.the staff be not so great , they focus exclusively on the service they have , so if you need someone to check if there be ticket in a theatre they do not work with , you will not find help .<ssssss>neither give you information on how to discover beij on you own.the food in the coffee shop be terrible , and most service close at 22h .<ssssss>nevertheless , you will find confort in the room .<ssssss>they be clean and beautiful .<ssssss>it be a good place to relax after you go crasy -lrb- positively of course -rrb- with the city !!<ssssss>be carefull with the tour .<ssssss>they all include take you to shop they like ... i hate that!anyway .<ssssss>it be a very good choice .<ssssss>good price compare to other hotel with the same level in beijing.i would tay here again .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 3 -1 2 -1		4 * my hat !<ssssss>my partner and i just return from 2 night at the park hotel and we be very disappointed with the hotel consider what we pay for it .<ssssss>i do not know how they get away with marketing it as a 4 * , more like a very average 3 * as it be very drab and dreary .<ssssss>breakfast be eur19 .50 which be a joke , the cook breakfast be awful and neither of we eat it.anyway this hotel be definitely not value for money and we will not be stay there again .<ssssss>
4 5 3 3 5 5 4 2		lovely hotel !!<ssssss>call the riverfront hotel , it be actually associate with harrah 's now !<ssssss>we just get back from jazz fest in new orlean .<ssssss>my husband and i be usually always at the marriott but we friend get we a great deal at the riverfront .<ssssss>since we book through harrah 's , we think we be at harrah .<ssssss>do not make that mistake and get drop off at big harrah 's or you will be hike over to the riverfront with you bag , or follow the bellman -lrb- who be so sweet to cart we crap -rrb- note : the new harrah 's hotel be beautiful!the riverfront be a smaller hotel down by the riverwalk .<ssssss>so if you want to be in the quarter or close to the jazz fest bus , this be a little farther of a walk .<ssssss>as i read in other review , complaint about the walk !<ssssss>yes , it be good for you , but after walk all day at jazz fest , the hotel on canal and in the quarter have one up on em!none the less , the room be very nice !<ssssss>very clean , new comfy bed , with the thick nice comforter !<ssssss>bed be very important to we !<ssssss>the air conditioning be not blow very hard in the room , so we call to see what they could do .<ssssss>maintenance be there in no time !<ssssss>they even call with a follow up after he left.the staff be very nice and helpful.i would recommend this hotel !<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		fine hotel , good value .<ssssss>wide open view from window ...<ssssss>
1 1 -1 5 2 1 2 1		ugh well where do i start ?<ssssss>horrible !<ssssss>.<ssssss>okay the location be good and the restaurant be superb .<ssssss>ralph market be across the street and great as well as dahlia restaurant .<ssssss>as for the hotel itself .<ssssss>we arrive there a hour early and be punish .<ssssss>desk clerk have something to say about we new yawk accent .<ssssss>we be then punish by be give a handicap access room that have no bathtub .<ssssss>the room be drafty and it face the parking lot and construction site which be noisy .<ssssss>the bed and the bed linen look and feel like they be from the original day of george washington .<ssssss>shabby and nasty .<ssssss>the tv be antiquated , the station limit .<ssssss>no fridge , small towel and never enough of they .<ssssss>parking be almost 30 dollar a night and internet be exorbitant as well .<ssssss>the pool be nothing to write home about and the fitness room be .<ssssss>, .<ssssss>limit as well .<ssssss>all in all i would say that if it be the last hotel in seattle i would sooner camp out .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 3 3 -1		avoid until construction be do i have be to this hotel before and like it in the past .<ssssss>as other reviewer have point out , the location be amazing , give the hotel 's private beach and that it be much closer to old san juan than similar beachfront hotel in isla verde .<ssssss>however , the caribe hilton be in the midst of construct a new addition and it be very loud -lrb- from around 7 be to 6 pm -rrb- .<ssssss>there be many hotel room that be affect by the noise .<ssssss>be awake by construction noise , be unable to use the patio , and not be able to take a afternoon nap all negatively affect my attempt to have a relaxing vacation at the caribe hilton .<ssssss>
4 4 5 -1 4 -1 2 -1		4 star for the room ; 2 for the desk staff .<ssssss>the room and the restaurant -lrb- and restaurant staff -rrb- be excellent .<ssssss>but the noise of the cleaner â?due to the uncarpeted passageway - and the rudeness of many of the desk staff -lrb- especially those on in the evening -rrb- be very off put and we wonât go back .<ssssss>walk to and from the hotel the first couple of day be okay but then it become tiresome .<ssssss>-lrb- btw we be fit ; frequent walker -rrb- .<ssssss>although the restaurant be fantastic it would have be nice to be able to dine at another restaurant , but this option be hamper by the location .<ssssss>-lrb- someone have say the staff recommend restruant in the area , but we be obviously unlucky with the staff during we stay -rrb- .<ssssss>if you have the money for taxi -lrb- which you canât always trust -rrb- or be use private transport the location wonât bother you .<ssssss>and if you have ear plug handy - nor will the noise .<ssssss>and if you can put up with the rude staff - by all means stay here .<ssssss>the restaurant and room wonât disappoint .<ssssss>
2 2 1 -1 2 -1 4 -1		avoid it ... .<ssssss>base on the glowing review here i book a three night stay as part of a extend family vacation .<ssssss>as anyone who try to stay in san francisco know , it be exceedingly difficult to find a hotel with free parking and queen bed -lrb- travel with teens ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>upon arrival the look on everyone 's face pretty much tell I i have make a mistake .<ssssss>let 's start with good : location be really step from pier 39 , parking be free .<ssssss>now the bad : this be hotel have no ac , which consider the temp in the bay area should be no problem .<ssssss>however , the room have only one teeny-tiny window -lrb- about 1ft square -rrb- to allow air into the room .<ssssss>the overhead fan do not do much to help pull fresh air in either .<ssssss>as a result the room be roast hot , even when the high temp for the day be 69 degree .<ssssss>and the location be extremely noisy .<ssssss>we third floor room face the sheraton and we could hear every bus , every car , constant noise day and night .<ssssss>i be use to have some noise in a hotel room .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but this be ridiculous .<ssssss>in short , we check out after one night a move to a hotel out of the city .<ssssss>oh yes , the elevator break that night also .<ssssss>the management be very understand and helpful ... but there really be not much they can do to make up for this hotel shortcoming .<ssssss>if you really must stay in the city , try find a deal at a higher class hotel through hotwire and then pay for the parking .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 3 2		dingy and dank !<ssssss>do not be fool by the other review .<ssssss>they must be write by the ownership !<ssssss>this hotel be gross .<ssssss>every fabric surface of the interior be stain .<ssssss>the bed be totally uncomfortable .<ssssss>at first i think they have I sleep directly on the box spring mattress !<ssssss>kid rent a room across the hall and be smoking marijuana outside my door .<ssssss>the smoke come into my room !<ssssss>seriously .<ssssss>i complain , but they do not kick the kid out for several hour .<ssssss>there be bum climb in the garbage can outside the hotel .<ssssss>i select the hotel because it be reasonably price and close to the downtown and space needle .<ssssss>guess what .<ssssss>it be not that close !<ssssss>you be still about 12 block from the main downtown attraction and about 6 block from the space needle .<ssssss>i take a cab downtown .<ssssss>if you look to save money i would suggest that you stay at hotel further away from the downtown area or pony up the extra buck a night and stay at someplace decent .<ssssss>seriously !<ssssss>this be not a joke .<ssssss>i live in east oakland california so i know what bad condition be , and this place remind I of a cheap rent by the hour motel !<ssssss>
4 2 3 -1 4 -1 4 -1		stay away from city side room enjoy the moana surfrider .<ssssss>stay be book by norwegian cruise lines.we have 3 night pre cruise stay before 7 day hawaius cruise .<ssssss>when norwegian book room you get room in the original building which be very very nice , but most likely you will be stick in city side room which have constant noise , traffic , people , and who know what all night long .<ssssss>for the money pay this should not be .<ssssss>other than that , stay be good and enjoy the hustle and crowd on wakiki beach for 3day , which be enough.plenty of shopping and nearby resturant .<ssssss>great location , and can rent surfboard and lesson nearby .<ssssss>would return again but would like tower ocean view room .<ssssss>why do not they put in some sound proof window like they do in airport location hotel ?<ssssss>
2 2 3 2 1 3 1 -1		just so so my family of three stay at the hotel for 7 day .<ssssss>i do n`t think the room be clean throughly for 5 of those day .<ssssss>we would leave a piece of something on the floor at various spot and it would still be there when we returned.the first day we be give 2 free bottle of water for 3 people then none at all .<ssssss>we leave a note and request more water and 2 more pillow the note stay on the pad for three day and the fourth day it be gone.nothing be left.would i stay again i do n`t know.the staff be great but i agree with one poster they do make fun of the people stay there i see it happen 3 time and one of the time it be at we party .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 5 5 5 -1		dinky room !<ssssss>we stay at the nadia from 21 - 23 august .<ssssss>i agree with a previous comment that you heart do sink a little when you arrive outside the hotel and see the entrance sandwich in a row of shop .<ssssss>my heart sink even more when we be show to we double room which be really tiny with barely enough room for myself and my partner to move in at the same time .<ssssss>however , after the initial shock wear off we find the room to be more than adequate .<ssssss>the bathroom be small but clean and the shower be surprisingly powerful .<ssssss>we room have a small balcony which overlook the main road and canal which be very pleasant as the weather be quite warm .<ssssss>although i do not notice the noise from the tram my partner begin to find they quite annoying!the staff at the hotel be very friendly and we be give useful map and a guide book on arrival .<ssssss>the location of this hotel be perfect .<ssssss>we be able to walk from central station and from the hotel to rembrandtplein , leidseplein and the museum quarter .<ssssss>we do not find it necessary to use either taxi 's or trams.i choose this hotel base on the review on this website , the hotel location and the fact that i want to stay somewhere with a bit of character and not a modern chain hotel .<ssssss>i would recommend this hotel and thoroughly enjoy my stay there<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 1 4 -1 3		not so grand i will try to keep a open mind when write this review , as it be easy to pick out only the bad point when tell about thing .<ssssss>i arrive at the san juan beach hotel 8/31/07 and be give a lagoon view smoking room .<ssssss>-lrb- i have request a ocean view non-smoking -rrb- i contact the front desk and be immediately swap into the proper room .<ssssss>the wall and floor be damp , but be fair it seem almost impossible that they would not be because of the fact that they be between the bay and the ocean .<ssssss>the floor be dirty ... no excuse for that ... there have not be a vaccuum in room 703 in quite some time -lrb- maybe month -rrb- so the sand just stick to you clean foot .<ssssss>the bathroom be not sweep the entire time we be there ... i know this because i actually circule -lrb- in pencil -rrb- the large dirt piece on the floor to see if the maid would notice -lrb- she do not -rrb- .<ssssss>the window be filthy !<ssssss>there be no excuse for how dirty the window be because have a ocean view it would be nice to see the ocean !<ssssss>my husband attempt to raise the window and the glass and frame literally come out of the track and fall into he hand .<ssssss>-lrb- luckily he get it back in track and leave it be . -rrb-<ssssss>the elevator be slow , but they get the job do .<ssssss>we have free continental breakfast everyday , expect for the day that someone take the key home with they and there be no breakfast .<ssssss>-lrb- i do not ask what key , i be afraid i do not want to know . -rrb-<ssssss>if you be not expect anything grand then you will be fine ... but i do prefer clean accomodation .<ssssss>i honestly feel that with a better housekeeping staff this hotel would be okay .<ssssss>sure the hotel could use a bit of time from the local handy man ... but the main problem be the dirt .<ssssss>i guess i would rather stay in a clean motel 6 than to stay in a dirty 4 star hotel .<ssssss>

3 3 2 3 4 1 3 5		better than other i have be to i stay at this resort from february 10-17 .<ssssss>for a four start resort it be not bad , but i would not give it anymore than that.food : food be good , there be always a variety that change from day to day .<ssssss>during the day there be 3 buffet , in the evening there be 2 and there be 4 a la carte restuarant .<ssssss>there be also a 24hr snack bar which always have pizza , hot dog and hamburger .<ssssss>we only try the italian restaurant and it be very good .<ssssss>the operating hour of the buffet be actually off compare to what the brochure say they be , it say they open for 6 for dinner but do not actually open till 7:30 .<ssssss>but i must say they do have fairly long hours.staff : staff for the most part be good .<ssssss>it help that i speak basic spanish .<ssssss>for those who do not speak spanish , french or italian i could see they have a hard time .<ssssss>staff be also good by not demand or constantly stick out they hand for tip .<ssssss>maid service be good , they would always leave fresh towel and arrange any clothes that be leave out neatly to the side.beach : beach be amazing and gorgeous , but pack .<ssssss>go early if you want a lounge chair.bars : there be tonne of bar , and the liqour be always flow .<ssssss>they be very generous with the amount of liqour per drink.entertainment : the entertainment put a lot of effort into they performance and they could be quiet humerous .<ssssss>there be also what we think be a second entertainment pavillion .<ssssss>turn out it be , but it be strictly in italian .<ssssss>there be a vera club located within the resort which be a group of italian tourist that have a portion of the resort to they , they even have they own entertainment staff .<ssssss>you be able to join they , but it be of no use if you do not speak or understand italian .<ssssss>they also have they own water sport equipment and life jacket , so make sure you do not accidentally use they , we do this and they be not very pleased with us.excursions : there be plenty of excursion to go on , and they be all very entertaining especially the 4 wheeler excursion and the 4 runner tour , but be warn bring money with you because they be not cheap.we also like the fact that there be a town nearby .<ssssss>we take the bicycle tour offer by the resort which be free and they take we through the little village , it be quite interesting .<ssssss>also the nearby village be connect down by the beach and you can walk through .<ssssss>just be forwarn , when go into town , or even for a walk down the beach line , you will be harrass by the local sell thing ... my favourite line be hey canada , no pst , no gst.rooms : well this be where we be frustrated and annoyed .<ssssss>the first room they give we be in block 99 we put we luggage in and then go back to the front desk to get a saftey depost key , when we get back we key card would not open the door , so we go back to the front desk and then they re-program it , we go back and forth 4 more time with the door still not open until they finally send someone to fix it .<ssssss>the next day after breakfast the same thing happen .<ssssss>luckily we be on the ground level so we leave the slide door open so we could hope in through the balcony if it happen again , and it do .<ssssss>the room in block 99 be also very damp and musty smell no matter if you leave the window open or the air conditioing on .<ssssss>we complain again about the lock and they send another guy out to take a look at , after about 2 hour the guy finally show up and say that the lock be break and we would have to switch room .<ssssss>sick of the non-sense we make the man call the front desk to explain the situation directly .<ssssss>front desk say they would send the bell boy to pick up we luggage in 15 minute to transfer we room , needless to say it be 3 hour before he show up .<ssssss>we get transfer to block 98 which be directly off the second smaller pool .<ssssss>this be also the block that belong to the vera club .<ssssss>this room be 10x better and come with complimentary rum and fruit .<ssssss>we do have a problem with have no water but only one day for about 2 hour , and the only reason we notice be because the toilet would not flush .<ssssss>2 day after be in this room we t. .<ssssss>v. quit work .<ssssss>we go to front desk to tell they and they brush we off say that the satellite be not work we would have to wait .<ssssss>i know that what he be say be bull so i get a maid clean a room on we floor to let I try the t.v. to see if it be work and it be , i go back to the front desk fume and nedless to stay within 20 minute we have a brand new t.v. deliver to the room.overall besides any situation we have to involve the front desk in we have a great time .<ssssss>front desk be not helpfull at all , they actually make situation worse which be odd consider they be the only one that can speak proper english.our second last day we get a call from the front desk say that they have over book the hotel and be offer certain guest to transfer to a 5 + star hotel for they last day stay , bavaro pay for the accomodation , as well as give each person $ 150 american per person just for take the offer .<ssssss>needless to say we take the offer and be transfer to the melia tropical caribe .<ssssss>it take we 2 hour to get settle there because ocean bavaro be late confirm the arrangement .<ssssss>once we get settle it be definatley worth it .<ssssss>the hotel be amazing .<ssssss>next time i be in the dominican i will be stay at the melia caribe tropical .<ssssss>it make the ocean bavaro seem like a 2 star .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		great value , many convenience i have stay at the terrace inn about a dozen time for business .<ssssss>i have always find it clean and comfortable .<ssssss>here be what i like about the terrace inn : free , easy parking ; friendly , helpful staff ; kitchenette in all room ; free wireless ; cheap !<ssssss>if you book directly with this location you can often get the mid-week manager 's special which be only about $ 70 -- unbeatable in this market .<ssssss>the hotel be very close to bc and bu .<ssssss>it be one block away from a whole food market , which be where i usually get my dinner .<ssssss>there be also many small restaurant nearby .<ssssss>there be a t stop about a block away , but the b line -lrb- comm ave -rrb- be incredibly slow , stop on nearly every street corner .<ssssss>in good weather it may be faster to walk down to beacon street and catch the c line .<ssssss>-lrb- it may be faster in bad weather too , but the walk would be brrrrrrrr ! -rrb-<ssssss>i usually skip breakfast , but they do provide basics : cheerio -lrb- plain -rrb- , froot loop , yogurt , toast , english muffin , pastry -lrb- not so appetizing -rrb- , hard-boiled egg , juice , coffee , tea .<ssssss>i wish they offer fresh fruit .<ssssss>the breakfast room be very pleasant and be open until about 10 pm ; guest can use the microwave -lrb- no nuke in the kitchenette -rrb- , as i often do .<ssssss>good cable selection , include hbo .<ssssss>if you do not have a laptop you can use the computer in the lobby for free .<ssssss>a printer be also available but i do not know what the charge be per page -lrb- if there be one -rrb- .<ssssss>the water pressure in the shower be fairly weak , as be typical of hotel in this category .<ssssss>if you have a lot of hair budget extra time for shampoo !<ssssss>the toiletries be very basic -- one reviewer complain about they but they seem fine to I .<ssssss>there be hairdryer in the rooms.an earlier reviewer complain about the bed but i have not have any problem , perhaps because i like a firm mattress.my regular room be a little dark -- they keep low-wattage bulb in the lamp .<ssssss>i have stay in a couple of hampton inn recently -lrb- not in boston -rrb- and they be much nicer , but also much more expensive .<ssssss>as a two-star hotel the terrace inn be amazing .<ssssss>as a three-star it be still pretty good .<ssssss>if you be on a budget and do not need name-brand shampoo or mint on you pillow , look no further !<ssssss>
1 1 3 -1 2 -1 1 -1		what a costly disappointment !!!<ssssss>this be a lengthy review that i hope will discourage you to book you vacation at this resort .<ssssss>i wish i have listen to other and not stay here.i will first start with the positive - as they be fewer in number!the beach be beautiful - the ocean water be shallow for about 20 foot , and have a completely sandy bottom .<ssssss>the water be warm and the ` seaweed ' be not the slimy stuff usually find elsewhere , and it be rake away all day by a crew of workers.the sand be white and soft and not so hot that you burn you foot .<ssssss>the beach lounger be plentifuly and comfortable .<ssssss>there be some shaded area for those who prefer to stay in the shade , but they be take fairly early in the day , so plan accordingly.now , on to the not-so-positive : the resort be nice enough - maybe a 5 star in dominican standard , but definitely no more than a 3 + by most standards.the room be average in size and upkeep - the musty smell must be a by-product of the 70 - 100 % humidity .<ssssss>the air conditioner work well , but be hard to regulate to the ideal temperature -lrb- either way too cold or too warm -rrb- .<ssssss>and finally , on to the negative : this resort most definitely cater to its own !!<ssssss>i would not say they be anti any particular nationality but more that they be pro they own -lrb- or at least all those that speak spanish or any derivative i.e. cuban -rrb- .<ssssss>we go out of we way , especially after read some of the comment here , to attempt to communicate in spanish from the moment we arrive at the resort .<ssssss>the staff at the reception desk be less than welcome to say the least .<ssssss>they could barely be bother to check we in .<ssssss>as a matter of fact , we be pass over 2x by staff until a gentleman half-heartedly check we in .<ssssss>the female at the front desk be rude !!!<ssssss>beyond belief .<ssssss>i even ask if speak italian would be helpful , since i could not speak that much spanish and the two language be similar .<ssssss>other than for 1 staff member , that be meet with complete hostility too.our first room be a joke !<ssssss>it be in building 1 -lrb- along with building 3 -rrb- which be the worst building to stay in .<ssssss>the balcony on all the room other than those that directly face the ocean -lrb- oceanfront only , not oceanview -rrb- be half-balcony .<ssssss>they be a small traingular shape !!<ssssss>after press the guy at reception 3 x more the next day , we be move to a oceanfront room in building 2 .<ssssss>same room setup , but full rectangular balcony right on the beach -lrb- same money - go figure -rrb- .<ssssss>the food - very disappointing !!<ssssss>the palace be consider the best of the resort , yet the food leave a lot to be desire .<ssssss>we think that breakfast be the best meal offer at the palace - unless you be really into dominican food all the way .<ssssss>the buffet at the beach resort be fairly well round .<ssssss>the steak house be decent - ask for you steak no more than medium , otherwise its very chewy .<ssssss>and definitely get there by 6:30 or so , otherwise you will be wait in line a long time .<ssssss>p.s. there be a couple of spanish speak group that come in the restaurant from the beach look to scoop a table or two without have to wait in line .<ssssss>the italian restaurant at the caribe be ok .<ssssss>la brisa , the seafood restaurant , be ok .<ssssss>do not know what all the rave be about re : the lobster they serve .<ssssss>mine and my husband 's lobster be small and overly grilled , and the garlic shrimp i order on the side be no bigger than salad shrimp and be very chewy .<ssssss>drink - they may be tasty , but for those of you who like to drink and get a buzz be warn - do not bother with mixed drink because they have next to no alcohol in they .<ssssss>i only drink for taste , so this be ok because i could drink several pina colada and not feel in the least bit tipsy .<ssssss>on the whole , you pay a lot of money for a all inclusive meal plan that be very dissatisfying.the staff - rude , condescending , inconsiderate , unaccomodating , and totally ok with you watch they treat ` they own ' like king and queen .<ssssss>in the 8 day and 7 night that we be there , and in the 5 resort that make up the barcelo bavaro beach resort , we encounter only 3 staff who be pleasant , kind , helpful and courteous .<ssssss>the rest , in the bar , restaurant , shop , public relation , tour desk etc. be pathetic .<ssssss>especially the female staff - they do not even try to hide the fact that they would look you up and down once or twice first before decide if they be go to even speak to you .<ssssss>keep in mind , these same staff be smile and serve spanish speak guest all around we at the same time that we sit and wait 10 minute for cutlery so we could eat we food , or 20 minute before have a glass of water pour , or we drink order taken.lastly - tropicalissimo - they say its like a vegas show !<ssssss>pleeaasse !!<ssssss>if you like raunchy , over sex , untalented people - by all means , go to the show .<ssssss>vegas offer beauty , talent and barely dress showgirl .<ssssss>tropicalissimo offere very barely dress girls.all in all , by the 2nd day i be wish i have go somewhere -lrb- anywhere -rrb- else , by the 5th day i could not wait to go home , by my final day i start get downright rude right back !!!<ssssss>please , look at another resort !!!<ssssss>
1 -1 1 1 3 3 1 3		horrible experience - and not near the airport we last night be the only hotel that be not book prior to go to europe and that be a big mistake .<ssssss>we book this thinking , due to the name , it would be near the airport .<ssssss>it be not - a solid 15 + minute away which mean a big cab fare to get to this from we other hotel in frankfurt .<ssssss>then they say they offer a shuttle - well first of all , it be not free , and second of all - there be only one and it be so full , my boyfriend and i could not even get on the same one -lrb- you schedule the night before -rrb- and they do not always drop they passenger off at the same location so we end up get separated and never find each other in the airport .<ssssss>breakfast ?<ssssss>free , but over run - so busy there be no place to sit , no milk , no spoon - i eat dry cereal with a fork out of a bowl ... and lastly , we non-smoking room reek of smoke , you could not get a elevator in the morning for at least 15 minute ... overall , a terrible experience .<ssssss>this be the only night of my 13 day trip that i do not enjoy and the only hotel i do not give a good review .<ssssss>stay away ...<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 2 3 3 -1		basic but great value i have stay here twice now , july 2006 and june 2008 , and it be much the same each time .<ssssss>on the plus side , the location be great and central , the rate be surprisingly low in what be normally a expensive town , and breakfast be include in most quote rate .<ssssss>it be not luxurious , and the staff be polite without be overly warm .<ssssss>on the down side , it can be a bit noisy at night -lrb- because of the location -rrb- , the fitting etc be clean but rather threadbare , and the breakfast be minimalist.so , if you be look for value and a great central location , this place be for you .<ssssss>you can spend you money see the sight or enjoy sf 's many restaurant etc , rather than hand it over to a pricier hotel .<ssssss>if you want a indulgent experience where the hotel itself rather than the city surround be the focus , then look elsewhere .<ssssss>
3 4 5 5 4 3 2 5		great location for neighborhood vibe we have stay in this property many time and on two occasion this summer .<ssssss>the location be downtown and the bike and walk path with river view run for mile along the hudson and begin in this area .<ssssss>it be a perfect spot to bond with the statue of liberty !<ssssss>we like the downtown area because it be quite and have a neighborhood feel .<ssssss>the hotel be close to tribeca , the meat packing district and soho .<ssssss>there be a large movie theatre just block away and many wonderful restaurant and the rest of nyc be only a cab ride or a subway ride away .<ssssss>the hotel have come a long way since it begin it be renovation .<ssssss>the room be fully up to speed , but the elevator be a different story .<ssssss>they be be refurbish and in the mean time be extremely slow .<ssssss>the concierge be okay at best -lrb- we live in northern new jersey and be in the city all the time , so for we it do not matter much -rrb- .<ssssss>hotel staff be just go through the motion and security do not seem to be around -lrb- which on we last stay over a year ago very much be -rrb- .<ssssss>the concierge lounge be very nice and breakfast be fine there .<ssssss>it be nice have a starbuck inthe lobby .<ssssss>we would stay here again for the view and because we like the general area , but would like to see hotel management instill a can-do attitude with it be employee .<ssssss>we will wait until the elevator refurbishment be complete !<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 3 4 1 -1		regrettable experience i book 3 room for 4 night through expedia.com in august 2008 , and give we experience a overall rating of two be generous .<ssssss>the bright spot of we stay be rachel at the front desk who be extremely pleasant and helpful and the nice bellman who assist we at the end of we stay -lrb- we have 7 in we party -rrb- .<ssssss>aside from these two point we stay be regrettable .<ssssss>i will admit that i have some blame as to the confusion with we room situation because i book through expedia -lrb- which i will not do again -rrb- .<ssssss>through expedia they have a contract with the hotel for king room only -lrb- which be not clarify until after book -rrb- .<ssssss>as i finalize we plan i realize that i have 3 king room reserve and i need three double , again i admit this be a error on my part ; however , the treatment i receive from the kimpton reservation desk , the in-house reservation agent and the general manager -lrb- who i emailed and didnât respond -rrb- be very rude and unhelpful .<ssssss>it be as if because i book through expedia i do not deserve the same service as any other guest .<ssssss>needless to say i be not able to change any of we room to double but again rachel be very helpful and arrange roll-a-way bed for two of the room .<ssssss>as one of the other review mention when we arrive there be not a bellman insight and we be not offer one at anytime during we check-in process .<ssssss>two of the room be freezing cold as it be in the 50âs during we stay .<ssssss>in one of the room there be a inch gap where the two window should meet and we have to put towel in the space to keep the heat in .<ssssss>in the other room the window in the bathroom do not go all the way up and there be a large opening .<ssssss>in order to keep the heat in the room we have to keep the door to the bathroom close make it most unpleasant take a shower in the morning .<ssssss>request for additional blanket , towel -lrb- since we use they in the window -rrb- and a iron take two to three call each .<ssssss>we be unable to get the concierge at all and when someone at the front desk answer they give we the wrong number three time and then charge I for three call from we room !!<ssssss>in regard to the beefeater that everyone think be such a great attraction the one in the evening be very rude and the one in the morning be completely unwilling to be of any service , he act put out if you ask a question .<ssssss>the sir franci drake , although beautiful on the exterior , have marginal room at best and a staff that leave much to be desire .<ssssss>i will not stay here again nor will i recommend it to anyone travel to san francisco .<ssssss>

we just give we name and be tell to come back in about a 1/2 hour .<ssssss>this be the only bar that actually serve you right away and do not make you feel invisible .<ssssss>the pool bar be a joke .<ssssss>you could probably be drown and no one would notice you .<ssssss>at one point myself and my sister wait a 1/2 hour and no one even look we way .<ssssss>if you be not do a beer bong you do not belong there .<ssssss>my kid be look forward to go to a swim up bar just to hang in the pool and drink a soda , what a disappointment .<ssssss>we do a few excursion - a two hour horse ride , which be excellent !<ssssss>the horse be a bit tired , but we go full gallop down the beach on we way back !<ssssss>the kid love this , but a word of advice , barter with the guy ; we go from $ 60 a person to $ 50 .<ssssss>we do a all day safari where they give you a jeep to drive yourself .<ssssss>it be a all day thing , but well worth the money .<ssssss>then we do a snorkele excursion ... the boat ride from hell !<ssssss>since we leave during a storm the water be very rough , rain pelt you like gun shot and you butt slam up and down on the metal seat , be just excruciating , i think it be because i be thin and do not have much padding .<ssssss>if you bring bread with you , the fish will eat it right out you hand , but watch you finger .<ssssss>the ride back be much smoother .<ssssss>my son have a cold when we leave , but it turn worse as the day go by .<ssssss>we go to the doctor at the resort and he send we to a clinic in a ambulance .<ssssss>we get to the clinic where they do not speak english .<ssssss>they take and x-ray of my son with I stand right next to he .<ssssss>then in broken english , the doctor say he have fluid in he lung and have to stay there for two day while i go back to the resort !<ssssss>be you freak ` en kid I !!!<ssssss>they tell I i have to come back the next day and see the pediatrician .<ssssss>needless to say i refuse and they send I back with zyrtec and a expectorant .<ssssss>zytec be for allergy , my son be already on allergy medication .<ssssss>i do not know if they think i be stupid or something , but i have be a mother for 13 year , i know my son just have bronchitis and need a anti-biotic .<ssssss>we take a cab back to the resort for $ 20.00 -lrb- thank god i have $ on I -rrb- and i find my sister and we go back to the resort doctor .<ssssss>i tell he that he have bronchitis and need a antbiotic , he hand it to I right there .<ssssss>within 3 day , my son be fine .<ssssss>my advice to anyone travel out of the country , go to you doctor and get a antibiotic and bring it with you .<ssssss>to top it off , when i get the bill for all this , it be $ 1200.00 and they have two day f service on it .<ssssss>i fight the charge and they change it to $ 800.00 .<ssssss>bottom line of this resort , people not helpful or friendly and give bad service .<ssssss>if it be not for the extra thing we do , it would have be a complete waste of my hard earn money .<ssssss>bring you pocket book because i spend and additional $ 1500.00 , not include my son 's medical bill .<ssssss>

4 4 5 3 5 4 5 3		nice hotel , so so location i recently spend the night at the hyatt regency embarcadero for a business conference .<ssssss>the actual hotel be beautiful , the room very comfortable , and the staff very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>i just be not very happy with the location .<ssssss>i usually enjoy shopping while in san francisco .<ssssss>it be located next door to the embarcadero shopping center , but there be only a few shop that i be interested in .<ssssss>the one advantage be there be a cable car stop right outside of the hotel that can take you to chinatown and over by union square .<ssssss>
1 1 4 4 2 2 1 -1		motel 6 service with ritz-carlton price for $ 450.00 / night , i would expect much better service than i receive during my four-night stay at mardi gras.the housekeeping be what i would anticipate from a motel 6 -- not a hotel with the reputation of r-c .<ssssss>management should take most of the manager who walk around the hotel in they three-piece suit greet guest and have they assist the housekeeping department.each day , i have to call the front desk to request that my room be make up -- and that be with wait until ~ 4:00 - 5:00 pm.pathetic.there 's a better chance that i will be the grand marshall of the zulu parade next year than that i will ever return to this hotel.bad riddance !<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 4 5 5 -1		if you want a good night sleep do not stay here this be not a 5 star hotel more like a 4 star .<ssssss>the staff be brilliant but the building though reasonably new be start to fall appart through neglect.check-in be fine as be all the staff encounter but the room be below 3 star as to maintenance .<ssssss>all facility be there lcd tv , mini-bar , power shower , whirlpool bath the list go on.but the maintenance of these be none existant.cheap laminate flooring be start to lift leave sharp edge to catch you foot on , the shower door fail to close as it be come away from the wall so massive amount of water cover the bathroom -lrb- remember it be a power shower -rrb- .<ssssss>the patio door on the minute balcony refuse to close or lock.the noise from the cruise liner outside we room until the early hour preclude any sleep , not that that be possible as the mattress and the pillow appear to be make of some stone substitute .<ssssss>even with the pillow menu a restful night be impossible.the general air of the hotel , as with the world trade centre complex be a little unloved which concider its age be surprising.i could not in fairness not recommend the hotel , i may just have be unlucky , but for the money any other hotel in barcelona would be better value .<ssssss>the possition of the hotel be great , near the city but not too near , easy level walk to all site .<ssssss>tourist bus stop outside the door and the ever attentive staff be all plus point .<ssssss>but oh the bed and the noise !<ssssss>and the appearant lack of any maintenance in room 751 .<ssssss>not recommend to people with a back , good hearing or though who wish to wash beyond that it be a very nice expencive and convenient hotel in which to stay.we have book three night but check out after the first .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
4 4 5 2 5 4 2 5		love it !<ssssss>i love it !<ssssss>at first i be skeptical because i feel like the picture be overate and be tear about where to stay .<ssssss>but i will say that i have no regret .<ssssss>if you have a really contemporary , chic , and down to earth personality , then this be the spot for you .<ssssss>i be very picky and i will say that i feel accommodate .<ssssss>the only thing i do not like be the management and the location they seem very tight on give you anything extra as far as special accommodation .<ssssss>for instance , we have a late flight and we do not realize that check out be at 12:00 so we want they to accommodate we with a room for a few hour and they want to charge we over $ 230 for the one night .<ssssss>but on the flip side they do upgrade the room when we first check in because they do not have we room ready to full oceanview .<ssssss>i also hear someone complain about that he always stay here when he come to puerto rico and this be the first time he do get any special treatment .<ssssss>so i think that management be very stern this go around .<ssssss>plus housekeeping throw out we bottle of rum and management come upstairs to verify how much liquor be leave in the bottle before they give up 6 coupon for free drink .<ssssss>it be located away from the other hotel so alot of the building around it be run down .<ssssss>since it be not near the other resort hotel you have to walk about 15-20 minute to participate in any of the water sport .<ssssss>but again i like the hotel itself .<ssssss>so sometimes you have to choose you battle .<ssssss>this hotel be definitely for people who can appreciate that miami flavor and i would not recommend this place to someone under the age of 13 and not to someone who be over 50 unless you be young at heart and very down to earth .<ssssss>so i hope all this help !<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 3 1 2 3		confused second time stay at the lkf .<ssssss>first time shortly after they open last year be fine reasonable size room ok service etc.this time i be travel with my wife and so take advantage of a email offer from the to be upgrade to a 60m2 deluxe room.on arrival i be somewhat surprise to find that my room be in fact smaller than the room i stay in previously .<ssssss>assume there have be some mixup when allocate the room i ring down to reception to advise they of the mistake only to be tell that the room be the 60m2 room in question.as a property developer i be reasonably adept at know the size of space but anyway measure the room and sure enough it turn out to be 35m2 .<ssssss>i then go down to the reception and speak with the duty manager who argue rather unconvincingly that a 35m2 room be actually the 60m2 room in they website and email promotion even after he agree that 5m by 7m equal 35 .<ssssss>the compromise be that i be move back to the room i have have previously which be larger and more suit to a couple although nowhere near the state size , it be consider a standard room and i note there have be no offer of reduce the price of the room from the deluxe that i have pay for.probably the next battle on checkout .<ssssss>

4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		wonderful boutique hotel we truly enjoy the extra touch of this boutique hotel , and the historical feel of the sorrento .<ssssss>the staff be outstanding and the town car a wonderful perk .<ssssss>the bed be extremely comfortable .<ssssss>the biggest negative be the very , very small bathroom .<ssssss>we have a lovely stay at the sorrento .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 1 -1 -1		disappointed as platinum starwood member , we have stay at a lot of westin and have come to expect pretty great thing .<ssssss>this hotel be disappointing .<ssssss>first of all , when we check in , we ask if there be upgrade available .<ssssss>we be tell there be a upgrade to a double bed room in the tower -lrb- we have book king ocean view with a balcony -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be definitely not a upgrade .<ssssss>it be narrow , feel like we be in a tunnel , and the ocean view be only possible if you crane you neck around to see it .<ssssss>we call down and ask for something different and be move to a small suite that have a view of mechanical thing out the window , very depressing .<ssssss>the lobby be gorgeous , the patio outside be gorgeous , but we will never come here again .<ssssss>to they credit , when we say we be leave for another hotel , they call ahead and assist we in get what we want at the royal hawaiian - a ocean view room with veranda and a king bed .<ssssss>unusual to have a sheraton be nicer than a westin , but we think it be .<ssssss>and the royal hawaiian be be completely redone this june .<ssssss>the bar near the water be such fun - great people watch , great music , relax feel here .<ssssss>we like it a lot .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 3 1 1 -1		not very impressed i organised a trip to amsterdam for a hen weekend and there be 10 of we range from mid 20 's to my mum who be just hit she 60th birthday.we be upgrade to this hotel shortly before we holiday be due and be happy as it be a higher star than we have originally booked.unfortunately upon arrival the receptionist inform we that we have to put a deposit down of about 50 euro each - can not remember what this be for , something silly like the mini bar or something but even so it be extortionate so i flatly refuse , as it would have be a total of about 500 euro and they want it from one credit/debit card !!!!!!!<ssssss>in the end they agree to let we off but bare in mind we land fairly late it be not really a warm welcome.we then go to we allocate room and there be a mix up with the smoking and no smoking room so we end up move room before we finally settle down for the night .<ssssss>the upshot of this be that half end up on one floor and the other half on another floor.we be book for bed and breakfast and the food be nice but the hotel have a rather stuffy feel about it , the staff seem to look down they nose at you - not sure if it be because we be a hen party and 1 of the night we do the hen thing with t shirt etc but we be not offensive or loud as we know we be not in magaluf !!!!!!<ssssss>the hotel be in a good spot , short walk to bar and restaurant and a short tram ride if you want to see the sight associate with amsterdam , brilliant street entertainer , red light district -lrb- which be not for the faint hearted !!! -rrb-<ssssss>overall we have a brilliant weekend when we be out of the hotel but probably would not book to the park hotel again - oh and we have a view at the back of the hotel look onto a disused warehouse or something - not pretty at all and lot of pigeon !<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 2 1 2 1		disappointed after have read the review about this hotel , i have higher expectation and i must say after my stay at this hotel this weekend i be disappoint .<ssssss>i be very unclear about where the good review be come from !<ssssss>i would say that i be a very reasonable person , widely travel , have stay at a range of accomodation from hostel to 5 * hotel .<ssssss>sure , the hotel be centrally located , and direction to the hotel clear , but i agree with another reviewer that this hotel be more of a hostel than a hotel .<ssssss>the bathroom have a pungent , old , dank smell to it and it be a wet bathroom - ie - you have to shower right over the toilet without a tub .<ssssss>the bed be quite hard as well .<ssssss>as for decor , because it be rain outside , they have spread out a white bath size towel on the floor which be damp and walk on and which we have to walk on to get to the stair ... not exactly inspiring .<ssssss>i walk by hotel closer to the center with much nicer lobby that look warm , newer and more comfortable for comparable price -lrb- i ask -rrb- .<ssssss>because the door to the room be so flimsy , in the morning we could hear they bird -lrb- they have pet parrot -rrb- shreaking and squacking and we could also clearly hear the lobby telephone ring throughout the hotel at 2am in the morning .<ssssss>although the man who own the hotel in the end allow I to pay for we two night with a credit card , he grumble about it , when i ask , he punch number into he calculator to say that because it be low season -lrb- â ?<ssssss>5 per night for 3 people -rrb- , i should be pay cash .<ssssss>i will not be stay here again .<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		great room , below average staff .<ssssss>i stay here with three friend -lrb- all 22-24 year old -rrb- .<ssssss>although we be a very respectful group , the staff treat we like 10 year old .<ssssss>when i return home , i write a letter complain about the staff and they do give we a hefty credit to we account .<ssssss>we all appreciate they willingness to correct they mistake.the room be great !<ssssss>very clean and comfortable .<ssssss>every room have a great view with a balcony .<ssssss>we have a great time despite the staff.i would stay here again !<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 4 3 3 3		quiet area but easy access to all sight we stay here as a family with two adjacent room .<ssssss>we double be quite roomy with the glass walled bathroom which other reviewer have comment about .<ssssss>personally we find it fine .<ssssss>the children ' room though be definitely on the small side and the storage area be difficult to use .<ssssss>perhaps this variation in room account for the differ review which this hotel get .<ssssss>the hotel be situate in a residential area next to the vondelpark -lrb- lovely for a stroll but mind the bike ! -rrb-<ssssss>but only a few yard from a tram stop which whisk you quickly into the city centre .<ssssss>the staff be just about acceptable but be neither particularly swift or efficient at the front desk .<ssssss>avoid the breakfast at all cost unless it be include in you room rate as it be not worth the money .<ssssss>they stop replenish the buffet half a hour before it be due to close so late comer go away empty handed .<ssssss>the quality be mediocre and dining room service poor with uncleared table everywhere .<ssssss>we pay Â£100 per room which be not cheap but it be high season .<ssssss>i have stay here previously out of season for under Â£70 .<ssssss>the breakfast be a unfortunate blot on what be otherwise a very pleasant stay and i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 2 5 2 2 2 2		they try to be elegant we stay at the w be prompt by a conference that my husband attend .<ssssss>since we want to see some of the city , we add a extra night onto we reservation at $ 259 for the night.check-in be somewhat confusing because of the 2 responsible payer .<ssssss>we double check the next day and find that we key would not be good for the third night and have to be reissue .<ssssss>the lobby area near the desk be very small and crowded .<ssssss>in fact , all the public lobby area be congest .<ssssss>off the lobby be a area call the living room for meeting and visit .<ssssss>the concept be good , the execution not so good .<ssssss>the seating be not conducive to visit and it would only accommodate a couple of group .<ssssss>consequently , no one use it .<ssssss>there be also a coffee -lrb- am -rrb- / liquor -lrb- pm -rrb- bar in the area with a picnic table the only place to sit.the room be small and overcrowded .<ssssss>a small sofa , a desk/table / bedside table and refrigerator be crowd in .<ssssss>prominently display be the item that if use , would be charge to you bill ... very pricy snack and drink .<ssssss>internet connection be $ 14.95 a day , bill promptly .<ssssss>a flat screen tv be wall mount above the desk , not convenient for view while sit on the sofa nor on the bed if someone be on the internet at the desk .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable , we sleep well .<ssssss>the plastic glass be not replace any day , so by the last morning we be share -lrb- they take away the use one each day -rrb- nor be the towel replace for the last -lrb- expensive -rrb- night .<ssssss>there be no microwave nor coffee pot .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 5 4 5 5		nice , with a few hiccup ... .<ssssss>the hotel be very nice , however , there be some annoying thing about stay there .<ssssss>most of the problem be due to the renovation that be currently go on .<ssssss>it be a pain to take two different elevator to get up to you room .<ssssss>we also have gold status , and normally that come with a private room where you can grab a quick continental breakfast .<ssssss>with this hotel , you literally have to take the time to be sit and you be require to order off the menu .<ssssss>that be fine when you be not in a hurry , but we happen to be in one.the last thing -lrb- and this be very minor , but i be go to mention it anyway -rrb- be that there be not a soap holder , and every time you wash you hand and sit the soap down , it would slide off the sink and onto the counter .<ssssss>just little thing like that could have be think of , when they do the design .<ssssss>they also do not think to put a garbage can in the bathroom either .<ssssss>overall , it be a great place to stay .<ssssss>especially the location .<ssssss>and if you can get away without stay there until the renovation be do , then i would definitely recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		good location to explore .<ssssss>ideal location for explore the city , 15 min walk from the main square .<ssssss>the hotel , bedroom and bathroom be very clean .<ssssss>and the staff friendly .<ssssss>excellent breakfast with a great selection .<ssssss>yes the bedroom be small and there be little natural light as the window look out onto a internal courtyard .<ssssss>the airconditioning be also a bit dodgy , but for a short break at this time of the year be quite acceptable .<ssssss>would not have be satisfactory in the summer.roof top jacuzzi and gym be free.would recommend for a short break but shop around to get a good deal .<ssssss>
4 2 3 5 2 5 3 5		be this the greatest hotel in the world ?<ssssss>yes and no !<ssssss>this be certainly one of my favourite place to stay and i would return to this hotel every time i travel to barcelona , that be of course , if i could afford it .<ssssss>let 's start with the negative point .<ssssss>the hotel be way overprice for what it offer .<ssssss>the room be basic and maintenance be a real issue .<ssssss>what be bright and shiny before do not remain so for long without excellent cleaning and good maintenance , both of which be not in attendence .<ssssss>the corner of the room do not look like they have be clean in month and there be very obvious wear and tear on the fitting in the room .<ssssss>there be some special offer that make the hotel more attractive but overall for the facility it offer , it be definitely overprice .<ssssss>that say , this * be * certainly the best thought-through and consider hotel i have ever stay at .<ssssss>the location be great , in a very nice part of town , minute from the metro and the aerobus stop come from the airport -lrb- get off at unversitat/universidad -rrb- .<ssssss>the staff be all superb , nothing be ever too much trouble and they be always eager to help out .<ssssss>it be thoroughly refresh to stay in a gay-oriented hotel , right down to the free pack of condom in the bathroom .<ssssss>the bed be extremely comfortable and the free water in the hallway very welcome , although it might be more environmentally beneficial to offer larger bottle to save wastage .<ssssss>i choose not to eat breakfast in the hotel , there be a cafe across the street that offer croissant and cafe solo for eur2 .35 and one further down that be even cheaper .<ssssss>the roof be superb and the jacuzzi open 24 hour a day .<ssssss>yes , the axel have problem , and there be no way i could justify pay they rate to stay here on every visit to barcelona , with lower rate available occasionally through they website , this be a great place to stay .<ssssss>

3 4 3 5 3 3 3 5		good value but poor soundproofing stay a week at the hampton inn .<ssssss>location be terrific - three avenue over from st patrick 's cathedral , around the corner from time square , handy for theatre , plenty of restaurant , subway across the road , bus run to central park west , etc. accommodation ok - good size bedroom with comfortable bed , but bathroom very small and on the shabby side .<ssssss>big plus be free and unlimited broadband access in the room .<ssssss>nice touch be complimentary breakfast -lrb- not gourmet class but quite adequate -rrb- , and unlimited coffee and apple in the reception area .<ssssss>only drawback be that soundproofing between the room be virtually non-existent .<ssssss>it be only a problem for we on two of the night - but could have be a serious negative if there be noisy neighbour next door !<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 2 3 2 1		could do better .<ssssss>.<ssssss>slightly disappoint with we stay here ... the location be amazing and the main reason that we pick itthe second reason be for the rooftop pool - however - when we arrive in late september we discover that it be not heat and that there be no facility -lrb- such as a bar -rrb- with it - despite the suggestion on they website that there be .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the third reason we select it be for the interior -lrb- we stay in a suite -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be certainly a good size and we have a great view overlook the cathedral but as over reviewer have suggest the lighting be terrible and impossible to see anything in the room in the evening .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we be also keep awake most of the night by the noise every evening - but then - who come to barcelona to sleep?all in all - probably a little too pricey for what it be - but certainly a great location<ssssss>
3 2 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		do not meet expectation my wife and i stay a single night out of a planned five nights.what we like be the immaculate grounds , spacious and beautiful .<ssssss>palm tree , flower , and well attend landscaping .<ssssss>we like the room itself , very clean , upgrade bedding , large bathroom and lot of marble .<ssssss>we have book a ` deluxe ocean view ' .<ssssss>what we do not like be the marble floor that click clack with each step of the guest above we , well into the night .<ssssss>the ` ocean view ' be some far off stretch of blue several hundred yard from we room .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be ordinary , not bad , but holiday inn level .<ssssss>you have better like lay around the pool , because the strip of sand that substitue for a beach lie 5 flight of stair up and down the cliff to reach it .<ssssss>the ` beach ' also have a bad habit of be completely submerge at high tide.the cliffside villa would be a more pleasurable experience but be pricey plus 21 % service charge and tax.we leave after the first night and go to the sheraton laguna @ nusa dua .<ssssss>that be less expensive , have a real beach , and more fun as we could jump into the lagoon right from we room level deck .<ssssss>
2 3 4 5 3 4 2 2		mandatory extra charge i stay at the lafayette hotel for 3 nights.for each day , i be charge 4.95 for the safe and 4.95 for communications.i do not appreciate the extra charge of 9.90 a day because i do not use the safe nor do i use the phone - the cell phone coverage be great!these charge be however , mandatory!other than that , the hotel be in a great location and the room be very spacious .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 3 -1 1		great location , great room i stay here for one night earlier this month .<ssssss>i be very happy with my stay in this hotel .<ssssss>the location , off via del corso , between the duomo and the piazza della signoria , be perfect for get around the city center -- everything be a short walk away !<ssssss>my room be clean and simple .<ssssss>it be a single but have a queen size bed and plenty of room -- i be there alone but i could have easily share it with a significant other or close friend .<ssssss>although i be only there for a one night stay , i could have comfortably stay there for much longer .<ssssss>the breakfast be so much more than most italian hotel offer .<ssssss>i could actually fill up for the morning there.the only bad thing : 1 -rrb- the internet connection be down and 2 -rrb- during a thunderstorm , water stream into my room from the close window , which i believe give onto the roof .<ssssss>this sound much worse than it be , as the water do not go anywhere when it hit the floor , i be not sure why .<ssssss>if i have drop my bag on the floor right under the window i would have be more upset , but since that be not the case , it do not interfere with my enjoyment of the room .<ssssss>

5 5 4 5 3 5 3 5		excellent value in hong kong i have stay in hong kong many many time on business - on a expense account .<ssssss>when i have to reach into my own pocket i ask business contact where they stay when they come to hong kong with they family and universally they say the metropark in causeway bay .<ssssss>we upgrade to a suite and we strongly recommend such upgrade .<ssssss>the suite be a very good size compare to many higher price hotel that i have stay in -lrb- e.g. , conrad , island shangri-la -rrb- .<ssssss>one great value be the 7/11 only 15 yard from the hotel entrance at which you can buy water/snacks/noodles .<ssssss>the internet work fantastic and the location be great - especially if you be willing to take 10 minute to learn to use the subway .<ssssss>there be a real bath in the bathroom which my wife like and the suite have a small second bathroom so that two sink could be in use at the same time when we be get ready to go out .<ssssss>downside - the airconditioner do not quite seem to work .<ssssss>also i have some business in town so ask the front desk for a official exchange rate statement for calculate my expense and they do not want to give I one and finally make I feel like i be a jerk for ask for one .<ssssss>other than that - on you own dime in hk - i strongly recommend this .<ssssss>hk be small and you can taxi everywhere from the hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 4 5 2 2		not one of kimpton 's best ... kimpton have a reputation for have beautiful , boutique-style hotel that offer exceptional service .<ssssss>the serrano hotel in san francisco be a disappointment .<ssssss>the location be fantastic in the most walkable city in america .<ssssss>we be able to get to all mode of transportation easily , great shopping be nearby , and great restaurant be convenient .<ssssss>but the hotel be not run like a typical kimpton.be prepare ... because it be in downtown , the space in the hotel feel squeeze .<ssssss>the room be small .<ssssss>i stay in a double-double with my husband , two kid , and a dog , luckily for just one night .<ssssss>afterwards , i stay in a queen room , corner of the building , and the room feel perfect for one person .<ssssss>kimpton be suppose to be pet friendly .<ssssss>though my dog be allow , no special attention be give , as occur at other kimpton .<ssssss>also , next time i go to san fran with a pet , i need to choose a place that have some grass/plants around so he can do he business!except for the doorman , all the staff assist we with a smile .<ssssss>however , they have odd policy .<ssssss>kimpton place a placard in the bathroom to let you know what they can provide in case you forget something .<ssssss>but when my friend mention she need a toothbrush -lrb- something the placard say the hotel will provide free -rrb- , she be tell to get one from the honor bar !<ssssss>at $ 3.00 .<ssssss>the hotel provide room service , but do not plan on use it early in the morning on the weekend .<ssssss>we have a 8 be bus to catch , and room service be not available until 8 oclock that morning .<ssssss>unfortunately , i have not see the fine print on the order form and be count on a 7 be meal from the hotel .<ssssss>i have to give my money to the starbuck in the hotel across the street instead.my complaint be all relatively small , but when you expect exceptional service and do not experience it , then the interpretation be disappointing .<ssssss>will not stay there again ... sorry , serrano .<ssssss>
4 -1 3 5 5 3 4 5		central location nice hotel stay at the crowne plaza after 2 night at the amstel and 1 at the holiday inn raus .<ssssss>the location of this hotel be central , ideal for explore the seedier side of amsterdam .<ssssss>my room be good and i be upgrade to the executive suite with club access which be great .<ssssss>my only critiscism be that the room and the reception area do need to be update very 1980 's .<ssssss>the staff be helpful and the free breakfast , drink etc. be fantastic .<ssssss>if you be look for a extremely central good quality hotel then i would recommend this hotel 100 %<ssssss>
3 5 4 5 3 3 4 5		excellent location .<ssssss>good comfy bed<ssssss>
3 3 2 2 2 4 4 -1		spacious , but not most convenient i be give this a average because this be nyc , if it be dalla or chicago it would be a okay .<ssssss>very spacious room , we stay at two hotel in nyc and would probably not stay here again .<ssssss>you be 4 block from grand central which to I be a major detriment .<ssssss>on the other hand , this be a place for traveler 's who need space , be with family , or be plan on be in nyc for more than a few day and do not want to feel cramped .<ssssss>huge closet space , kitchenette with fridge , and dishware .<ssssss>the linen be lack in quality and the room have a underlayment of funk .<ssssss>for example , there be a chair that have a deep white stain , from what i have no idea .<ssssss>however , the room be quite clean other than that .<ssssss>i know , sound oxymoronic , but it be hard to explain .<ssssss>i would relate this hotel to a motel six , still a good value for the money , just not for we .<ssssss>note : the pic on trip advisor be much more reflective of the actual hotel rather than the travel website .<ssssss>benefit ; huge room for nyc standard , kitchenette with fridge coffeemaker , hot water , decent -lrb- not great -rrb- towel , good for people with kid or teenager .<ssssss>actually have a view , friendly staff.detriments : not the most convenient to metro , weird funk/feel , no ice on floor , have to go downstairs or order from housekeeping , elevator very busy , so we always take service elevator or stair .<ssssss>bed linen not the best , only one nightstand -lrb- drive my wife nut -rrb- , curtain do not close .<ssssss>
3 4 4 -1 3 -1 2 -1		good stay , functional hotel in quiet area my boyfriend and i stay at the affinia dumont for 4 night on the basis of the recommendation on this site .<ssssss>whilst we enjoy a comfortable stay in the hotel , i would say the hotel just meet my expectation which be fairly high in light of the hotel 's no. 2 ranking on ta at the time of booking .<ssssss>however , have stay in ny before on only one previous occasion -lrb- in 5 * hotel at company 's expense -rrb- , it would be fair to say that i do not know what to expect for a 3?1/2 * hotel and for the $ we pay .<ssssss>despite the initial downbeat tone of the review , there be many positive .<ssssss>the hotel room be very spacious .<ssssss>we book a studio suite which contain a great king size bed , comfy chair , nice work area , good size kitchen area and a adequate bathroom .<ssssss>the decor be in good condition and neutral , albeit we be not big fan of the duvet cover .<ssssss>we also change we pillow straight away as we be initially supply with feather one -lrb- not good for allergy -rrb- .<ssssss>the kitchen area contain everything you would need to prepare basic meal but we choose not to use it as there be too many great dining option in the city .<ssssss>we also do not eat at the bark dog for the same reason .<ssssss>the bathroom be a little bit small but this be more than compensate by the excellent shower -lrb- constant hot water and good water pressure ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i have stay at a number of hotel which would have be excellent but the shower let it down .<ssssss>i be glad that the dumont do not have the same problem.we also like the location of the hotel .<ssssss>at first we be put off by the nearby building which be residential and look a bit bleak .<ssssss>however , we soon warm to it .<ssssss>ok , so the immediate location be unlikely to feature in any romantic movie , but be convenient for we gawk tourist who want to explore most of the city on foot .<ssssss>the subway on 33rd street be very close to the hotel and penn station be only a 10 minute walk which give you the option of take the long island rail road -lrb- lirr -rrb- to / from jfk .<ssssss>we take the lirr from jfk to the hotel and be happy to save the $ 40 compare to we $ 60 cab fare on the way back .<ssssss>we first stop be always go to the empire state building so it be great that it be a straight walk along 34th from the hotel as we be exhaust after a early flight .<ssssss>macy 's be also nearby for those who love department store -lrb- too much choice for I ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>on the negative side , we room be by no mean a room with a view .<ssssss>on book the hotel i specifically ask for a room with a good view of the manhattan sky line since we stay be for my boyfriend 's 30th birthday .<ssssss>we view be pretty appalling as it overlook a car park and some other run down building .<ssssss>it be a bit of a shock at first so i immediately go back to reception and ask if we could change room to one with a view , ideally of the chrysler building -lrb- which the hotel be mean to offer -rrb- .<ssssss>whilst the receptionist be polite about my request , she do not really make much of a effort to accommodate it and say that she could not offer we a alternative room .<ssssss>i find this a bit unusual consider that the hotel be by no means fully book .<ssssss>i have also read a number of review of this hotel where guest be offer a upgrade but that certainly be never offer to we .<ssssss>not much i could do though so i return to my room with a dismal view .<ssssss>i doubt the view would have look much better even if the window have be clean ... we have a couple of other gripe as well .<ssssss>firstly we return to the hotel one day to get change for the evening only to find that we hotel room door have be leave open by the maid .<ssssss>we have leave she a tip every day as well !<ssssss>thankfully nothing be miss but that should never have happen in the first place .<ssssss>we other gripe be that room service finish at 11pm .<ssssss>for the city that never sleep we find that a bit early .<ssssss>we go to the basketball , theatre , etc in the evening and would have appreciate be able to get a meal back at the hotel one of the night as it be so cold outside to walk around .<ssssss>i appreciate that not every hotel can offer 24 hour room service , but midnight would have be good enough for we .<ssssss>additionally , while the hotel be of a good size , we get the impression that there be lack of staff as no matter what extension we dial we get through to the same person on reception !<ssssss>overall , we have a good stay at the affinia dumont and would definitely consider return , perhaps to the affinia 50 property .<ssssss>however , i think it be only fair that potential future guest be more aware of some of the shortfall of this hotel .<ssssss>like everything else , the hotel represent a compromise .<ssssss>in this case the compromise be between space and ambience as the hotel be a bit clinical -lrb- as you would expect from a hotel aim at the business market -rrb- .<ssssss>i would still nevertheless recommend the hotel to those who regard space as they main priority when select a hotel .<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 5 -1 2 -1		mixed experience stay there the last weekend in august .<ssssss>when we arrive at around 2.00 h in the afternoon -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>, we room be not ready .<ssssss>though we check in we baggage have vanish when we come back two hour later .<ssssss>it take about thirty minute to retrieve it .<ssssss>my companion could not be find on the list of register guest at all , so she only get she room after quite a hussle .<ssssss>next day , my card which operate in lieu of a key for the room do not work , so i could not enter my room .<ssssss>finally , noone of the staff help I with my bulky luggage when i try to carry it to a wait taxi .<ssssss>the hotel certainly be okay for business -lrb- access to the internet , computer , etc. -rrb- , but if you be in berlin for leisure , try you luck elsewhere .<ssssss>
2 1 3 -1 2 -1 3 -1		higher expectation for a 5 star hotel i expect better accommodation and better treatment .<ssssss>-lrb- the london marriott kensington the week before have be such a delight -rrb- .<ssssss>pro : location , housekeeping staffcon : holiday inn-ish room , abrupt front desk , concierge and doormenupon check in , my bathroom have a extremely strong urine odor .<ssssss>i contact housekeeping immediately and they hand clean the toilet area .<ssssss>the smell be still there several hour later , albeit less so , when they call to check at which point they send someone with a steam machine .<ssssss>i be glad to report that this do the trick otherwise i would have require another room.the housekeeping staff have be responsive and attentive .<ssssss>the front desk , doorman and concierge have be curt , abrupt but polite .<ssssss>they have not go out of they way to make we feel welcome that be for sure .<ssssss>the front desk have a problem with pick up the phone .<ssssss>i must have call 3 time before i finally reach someone .<ssssss>concierge keep interrupt I when i be try to ask question , as if he could not spare the time.i need a taxi one day and the doorman behave as if he be do I a favor .<ssssss>the taxi driver tell I he have be wait several hour for a more worthy fare to the airport and do not hide he unhappiness that my ride be only go to yield 8 euro .<ssssss>accord to he , the doorman can pick and choose the taxi wait in the rank because they get pay part of fare by the taxi driver ... what a racket!for 309 euro per night be a big disappointment .<ssssss>if you can get the room for 100 euro a night , as some reviewer have , then i say go for it .<ssssss>otherwise keep you expectation low .<ssssss>my husband and i have travel a lot and sorry to say this have not be one of we most memorable experience .<ssssss>
3 1 1 3 1 4 3 -1		not up to marriott standard -lrb- jw or not . -rrb-<ssssss>i have to agree with the author below .<ssssss>this hotel be not even close to even regular marriott standard .<ssssss>it be very dated particularly the room .<ssssss>the carpeting be something out of the 1970 's and be wear and in need of replacement .<ssssss>the bathroom vent appear burnt and have a disgusting look to it .<ssssss>the shower , which be freestanding glass enclose badly need regrouting .<ssssss>water pressure be slow in the bathroom sink .<ssssss>you can see where this be go .<ssssss>better bet for the money be the sf marriott on 4th street or the new hilton on kearny - both property be very good have stay at both numerous time .<ssssss>hopefully someone at marriott will see this and get go on get this hotel up to snuff as it do have a lot of potential .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 4 1 2 -1		forewarn be best ?<ssssss>i reserve with the w week in advance and be look forward to a three night stay in this reportedly upscale location .<ssssss>when we know we would arrive late we call the hotel in advance , even though the room be guarantee with a credit card , to be sure they do not give away we room .<ssssss>upon arrival we discover they be book for the night -lrb- this be midnight after a very long drive -rrb- and that they be go to put we up at a hotel within walk distance .<ssssss>have you ever be completely exhaust and have to walk down the street with the bellman who have you luggage on a cart ?<ssssss>on the upside we stay at a excellent location , the st. regi ... which i would highly recommend .<ssssss>they comp we room and parking .<ssssss>.<ssssss>so the w try to make amends .<ssssss>late checkout at st. regi before hike back down the block be necessary due to meet obligation ... and be graciously arrange at the st. regis.upon re-arrival we room be not yet ready ... so we leave we bag with the bellman who take they up for we .<ssssss>the room at the w pale in comparison to the st. regi , although the comparison be the issue .<ssssss>it be actually fairly well appoint with modern furnishings , comfortable bed , and a nicely update bath -lrb- glass countertop , stainless sink , etc. -rrb- .<ssssss>we view be rather exceptional.there be no phone book in the room , no map of the hotel , no emergency evacuation map in the room ... and the phone seem standard and have no button mark for dial up different service .<ssssss>the typical hotel traveler will find these item oddly absent .<ssssss>the phone issue be especially frustrating as they w book take a while to flip through to figure out who to call for what ... just dial ' 0 ' and forget it!the location be superb , and here be where the w stand out .<ssssss>we be across the street from the convention center and next door to the museum of modern art .<ssssss>shopping and cable car line be a short walk from the hotel .<ssssss>we easily get down to fisherman 's wharf and then back up from ghiradellus square late in the evening on these lines.this be not a family location however .<ssssss>i travel with my teenage son for a business meeting and be more than uncomfortable with the lobby area which be basically a bar and lounge .<ssssss>we find it necessary to enter the door closest to checkin desk and valet entrance to avoid have to pass through this very singles orient atmosphere.a room decoration fall off the headboard and fortunately hit the unoccupied pillow during dinner ... a real topper to some annoyances.room service be fair , the coffee be good but i find it overprice for the quality of food.we be give a complimentary cracker , fruit , and cheese plate as a gesture we first night 's stay and receive a write and in-person apology and offer of assistance.in sum , if you be comfortable with these arrangement i would recommend it ... as stay at the st. regis be a pretty good exchange for the booking problem ... but i would not recommend it for family .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 4 2 2 -1		horrible experience in nikko we be stay at nikko bali resort spa since wednesday , may 2nd to may 6th , 2007 .<ssssss>we book the hotel directly to its reservation .<ssssss>we have be a long time customer for nikko bali resort spa and have be stae in this hotel ever since the hotel be brand new and always stay at nikko bali resort spa everytime we go to bali .<ssssss>since i be in college until now my son be 3 year old .<ssssss>so , we be always look forward for we next trip to nikko .<ssssss>so far we be extremely satisfield with what nikko hotel have be offer we , the view be spectacular , the room be wonderful , the pool and the beach be beautiful and the staff be friendly .<ssssss>we be actually go to bali since april 30th , 2007 and stay in melia bali nusa dua because we have be tell that nikko have be fully book .<ssssss>but still eventhough we trip be great at melia nusa dua hotel , but it be never be complete without stay in nikko resort spa in nusa dua .<ssssss>we have so much memory in this hotel for year .<ssssss>i would recall this hotel as we number 1 fave hotel in balus .<ssssss>it be a big mistake to switch hotel from melia bali to nikko this time .<ssssss>we book pool access room , and pay $ 240 something per night which be a very significant money but the room be absolutely horrible .<ssssss>the first night , the air conditioner do not function well .<ssssss>we ask the tecnician to check the air conditioner the next day , but once again the air conditioner do not work well in the evening .<ssssss>what happen be that the air conditioner work during day time and early morning time , but the room be very humid and warm during the night time , usually around 10 pm .<ssssss>we have a toddler -lrb- 3 year old -rrb- who be not able to sleep well during we trip this time at nikko hotel .<ssssss>it keep like that and during the day time , we always have the technician check the air conditioner and we become very paranoid about the terrace slide door because we have be tell that on top of slide door on the terrace , we need to make sure that the both triangle should be meet .<ssssss>during night time , all of we become very paranoid and go back and forth to check the slide door and make sure that the triangle sign meet because the room be very humid .<ssssss>i finally place a strong complaint about the whole hassle we experience .<ssssss>it be too bad after enjoy the beautiful beach and the pool , we have to get through the horrible room .<ssssss>the room be not worth for the price they ask !!!!<ssssss>we finally decide to extend for 1 more night from the may 6th to may 7th and have be tell that we can not do that because they do not have any room for we .<ssssss>but what be strange be that when we contact the balinese travel agent to get the hotel voucher that we have be tell that the room be available .<ssssss>we do eventually purchase the 1 extra night through travel agent and pay $ 255 for 1 night .<ssssss>now , i wonder how can a 5 star hotel like nikko be not able to offer we any room when we want to extend the room but it take we to purchase from the travel agent to extend we room for 1 more night ?!<ssssss>what be get more weird that be we do not have any cushion for we chair on the terrace and we finally complain about it , they bring cushion only for the bottom while the same other room have back cushion and bottom cushion .<ssssss>the guy who bring the cushion tell we that they do not make the back cushion for we terrace .<ssssss>i tell they that they must be kidding , because all other room for access pool room have back and bottom cushion .<ssssss>then he immediately say that they be currently place order for more cushion , that be why they do not have the back cushion for we .<ssssss>when we be complain about he bad excuse , suddenly he say that he will bring the back cushion tomorrow morning .<ssssss>i say that they must have a miracle because suddenly the back cushion be available after they say that they be still order the cushion .<ssssss>what a excuse !!!<ssssss>i just can not stand it anymore and finally place a strong complain and the next day the guest relation officer which be from japan contact I .<ssssss>they just simply appologize .<ssssss>we have be stay in hyatt , marriott and sheraton around the world before and usually if problem occur , especially as significant like what we have experience , these hotel will offer complimentary for we .<ssssss>we do not ask for a free room , not at all , but we just feel for the amount we pay per night , this room just simply do not worth at all !!!!<ssssss>you might as well spend you money at ritz charlton or ali intercontinental than stay in nikko !!<ssssss>

3 3 3 3 4 4 5 2		decent hotel in almost shady area base on the review i have see on here , i be initially a bit afraid to stay here .<ssssss>however , i be not disappoint by my stay in any way.first off , opal be a old hotel , so do not expect to be stay in the hilton or anything like that.first impression : the airport shuttle drive I straight to the hotel .<ssssss>the lobby be clean , and it appear that the hotel be well keep up .<ssssss>the front desk man who help we be very nice , and answer all of we question .<ssssss>he give we a map and tell we how to get to the place we want to go .<ssssss>so far , so good.the room : i walk in and be surprise at how large the bedroom be .<ssssss>two queen size -lrb- i think -rrb- bed for three of we , and more than enough room to stretch out .<ssssss>the room be clean , the sheet be clean , no problem there.the bathroom : this be where i usually worry the most , because this be normally the place where housekeeper neglect to clean as thoroughly as need , and i have see some review on here about that .<ssssss>but no problem there either .<ssssss>i always look for stray hair on the floor , toilet , or sink , and do not see any .<ssssss>it be clearly a old bathroom with a old tub , old sink ... but by old , i do not mean unkept or kitsch .<ssssss>just old-fashioned .<ssssss>continental breakfast be fine .<ssssss>just what you would expect - bagel , danish , orange , cereal .<ssssss>nothing fancy , but nothing awful .<ssssss>it get we energize for the day.location : on the edge of the tenderloin district .<ssssss>not the best part of town but not the worst .<ssssss>there be bum outside of the area at some point , but they be harmless and just ask for money .<ssssss>sf be a big city , and there be homeless people all over the big city , so that be just a risk you have to take if you be go to visit a large metropolis like this one .<ssssss>i do walk around a bit at night , but be cautious to stay in light area .<ssssss>i would not recommend walk around too much just for the simple fact that again , it be a large city , and anything can happen , especially if you look like a dumb tourist.close attraction : not much in walk distance .<ssssss>across the street be tommy 's , a bar that look pretty busy every night i be there -lrb- 4 night -rrb- .<ssssss>mel 's diner be next door and part of the hotel , open 24 hour .<ssssss>it be just a greasy spoon , but if you be hungry and everything else be close , it be not too shabby and the portion be huge .<ssssss>there be also a gym and a amc theater on the block .<ssssss>i see other restaurant , like a persian restaurant , a bakery , a quizno 's down the block and a thai restaurant , but do not go into any of them.transportation : bus line be very close to the hotel run north , south , east and west -lrb- van ness , geary , and o'farrell -rrb- .<ssssss>you will have no trouble get on these bus .<ssssss>very convenient .<ssssss>about 5 min from union square .<ssssss>no more than 10-15 from any other tourist attraction.all in all , not a bad place .<ssssss>it will not exceed you expectation but if you value a convenient location and a decent stay , you will not be disappoint .<ssssss>the price be not cheap , but it be the cheapest we could find close to the place we want to go without go to a dangerous area of town .<ssssss>

1 1 3 1 5 1 1 -1		no return back we stay there 6 night during thanksgive holiday.the check in lobby be small and if you walk from the bakery side to the check in area there be cigarette smell all over you clothing because you need to pass some restaurant area , either people love to smoke there or the circulation of air be not good enough at the lobby.when i book the hotel i have request a room far away from the track , but i still get the room face it .<ssssss>after i call the front desk , they change to the room on the side , but still you can hear the track .<ssssss>i always need fresh air , as the heater be too warm even i turn off the heater unit .<ssssss>when i open the window it be very noisy , and also with this oily smell or bbq smell come in the room , i guess from the restaurant below .<ssssss>you can see the tokyo tower but also many air condition unit on top of building , it be a bad view , as i be wonder the air come out from the air condition unit be harmful or not if you have the window open .<ssssss>the room size be okay , but not much storage place for you luggage.this hotel and the annex be very close to the track.i read review before i book this place , i totally disagree with the good comment .<ssssss>i enjoy my trip but stay at this hotel sure make I not happy .<ssssss>the receptionist speak limited english , with the copy of the map not even clear , take we a while to find the atm machine .<ssssss>even it be kind of close to ginza , i still would not recommend it .<ssssss>there be one more problem , i have a sprint phone card with I to use , i call the front desk to get the instruction of how to dial to usa use sprint phone card so i do not have to pay the hotel , she give I a number to call .<ssssss>during the check out time they charge I for the phone call , i tell they what happen , they still want I to pay , however , it be connect to sprint and i do key in my phone card access number .<ssssss>so now i have to pay sprint and pay the hotel .<ssssss>it be not fair if the operator have problem understand english.i stay many time at crown plaza hotel metropolitan tokyo at ikebukuro , some people think it be out ot the way , actually it be not it take short time to ride on the metro and get you to everywhere , and walk to the station be so close and there be also so many big department store at the station and can shop and eat very easily , and the atm machine be one minute walk distance from the hotel .<ssssss>lobby at the hotel be hugh with lot of sit area that you can read news paper , and also a computer room you can have free access , also a buffet restaurant at the ground floor , and a good bakery shop .<ssssss>the front desk people speak perfect english and very helpful .<ssssss>the reason i do not stay there because my partner want to stay at a different hotel to try.now no more try .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		great location for budget mind traveler have the priviledge of stay at the bamboo on a recent vacation to honolulu .<ssssss>the hotel be clean and well manage .<ssssss>the front desk staff be professional , attentive and courteous .<ssssss>the lobby and pool area be update , well appoint and pleasingly decorate .<ssssss>we room be small but comfortable ... typical of most older building .<ssssss>you can not beat the location unless you want to pay 2-3x more for you room right on the beach .<ssssss>top notch , elegant or fancy would not be word i would choose ... but for a budget mind traveler look for a clean place to sleep , bathe etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>you have get one .<ssssss>run you air conditioner to kill some of the street noise that be abundant everywhere in honolulu .<ssssss>the higher floor room obviously be better for this as well .<ssssss>travel by profession ... i find this to be a very acceptible alternative to the high price mainline hotel leave more $ $ $ for the stuff you really want to do and see in hawaii .<ssssss>
2 3 4 4 3 1 3 -1		stress , stress and more stress if you be think of book a hotel near the airport pre or post flight with the least stress factor , then do not book here.we actually stay five night and prepaid.first , without doubt , it be the longest i have ever wait for a courtesy bus from the airport to the hotel.one solitary front desk clerk be try to book in several guest , so another prolonged wait.of the five elevator -lrb- there appear to be no service elevator , so maid and porter have to use the only one accessible to guest -rrb- , four be work .<ssssss>so to get to the seventh floor -lrb- where we room be -rrb- it often take 10 to 15 minute .<ssssss>multiply this at least five time a day and you can sense the annoyance.this be further aggravate when issue key card mysteriously and frequently do not work which require another extend wait to get they re-issued .<ssssss>the lure of a ` cook to order breakfast ' have its booking attraction , but the reality be quite different .<ssssss>every day we have to line-up behind 20 to 30 people and then scrable to try and find a clean unoccupied table.it do not seem to make a difference whether it be 7am or 9am .<ssssss>the noise generate from literally score of seemingly un-supervised child in the breakfast room and lobby drown out any jumbo jet take off over the hotel .<ssssss>on we first night we try the solitary restaurant -lrb- the barcelona -rrb- .<ssssss>after first be tell we would have to wait as they be busy .<ssssss>we be seat some minute later , only to count 13 diner and at least 6 serve staff.we give up on room service one night as we could not get a answer from either the front desk or room service numbers.two other night room service work well but be prepare to pay $ 2.50 delivery charge plus 20 % service and then a tip on top.on we last day we have arrange for a late check-out only to have the room maid bang on we door at least 10 times.and finanally , after settle we extra bill , at 1.50 pm we wait for a 2pm airport courtesy bus .<ssssss>when it have not arrive by 2.10 pm , i question reception as to when we could expect it and the concierge state with have miss the 2pm , despite be there the entire time.in hindsight , we have a choice of two hotel , embassy suite or the sofitel .<ssssss>next time , i will waive the ` free cook to order breakfast ' and book somewhere i can hear myself think and access my room in a reasonable time .<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 4 3 2 -1		too many issue we stay at the hyatt at fisherman 's wharf for 2 day and 2 night .<ssssss>we rent a 2-bedroom suite and the accomodation be nice .<ssssss>assume the service at the hotel have be average , this would likely be a 4-star review.however , service be poor .1 -rrb- call front desk three time over a 1 hour period for a key to one of the bedroom .<ssssss>no luck , i finally have to walk down and get it myself .2 -rrb- hot breakfast serve cold -lrb- i mean not remotely warm , truly cold -rrb- .3 -rrb- wireless internet be $ 9.95 / day and it cut out about once every 20 minute .4 -rrb- we bag be store when we check in as we room be not ready .<ssssss>when it come time to pick up we bag , the staff could not find one of they in the storage room .<ssssss>they look for a few minute and say it be not there .<ssssss>i ask if i could help .<ssssss>i go in and find it in about 5 seconds.there be four or five other thing i could list but i think i have make my point .<ssssss>just too many misstep for a stay that be less than 48 hour long.the location -lrb- near the wharf -rrb- be ideal and , for the most part , the staff be friendly and try to be helpful .<ssssss>the rate be reasonable as well.this hotel have the potential to be a good hotel however they need to make numerous change before i recommend anyone stay there .<ssssss>
3 4 3 5 5 5 4 3		so-so soho my partner and i just return from europe which include a 4-night/3 - day stay at the vincci soho in madrid .<ssssss>i must first say that read the other review of this hotel -lrb- and other -rrb- on the tripadvisor site be a huge help to I .<ssssss>the other review be decidedly mix on this hotel and i even exchange direct email with one recent reviewer from the state for more info before leave .<ssssss>while none of the review turn I against stay here , they do provide some great info which be exceedingly helpful in know what to expect before we arrived.thankfully , in real life the hotel look every bit as it do online , so there be no surprise .<ssssss>the vincci soho be 4-star rate ultra-modern/boutique-y hotel .<ssssss>as far as the star go , i guess it live up to that as far as european standard be concern .<ssssss>we find the hotel and room well appoint , immaculately clean and everything in work order .<ssssss>the rate be decidedly not for those on a tight buget , but they be reasonable for a hotel of this type in a big european city i would say .<ssssss>be advise that it be a very modern/sterile motif , devoid of any local character or charm , though the outside front be nice enough look and blend in very well with the neighborhood .<ssssss>after read the review here , i be advise about two thing with this hotel ; odd room shape/size/location and the noise level.with regard to the room shape/size/location , we room be in the adjacent building of the hotel -lrb- there be apparently 2 different building join together -rrb- , directly behind the front building , and we room face the back street -lrb- not the side street -rrb- , which require walk down long corridor and two different elevator to get to we room only on the 3rd floor .<ssssss>that be a bit of a drag , but not too big a deal .<ssssss>the room be moderate/modest size -lrb- almost large by european standard but border on small by we standard -rrb- , but even by we comparison , it be adaquate for the two of we without feel cramped .<ssssss>but the room be at very sharp and strange angle , which waste space and be disturb to the eye .<ssssss>even the bathroom , which be decent size , have a odd angular shape .<ssssss>we do have a double-door/window and tiny balcony/ledge face the back street , which be nice .<ssssss>and the bed be exceedingly comfortable and there be a flat panel wall mount tv .<ssssss>the room be a bit too warm for we -lrb- from what we be use to at home in sf bay area where we prefer to sleep with much cooler room temp at night -rrb- and repeat attempt to lower the thermostat bring no real relief .<ssssss>we end up have to sleep with the window crack , which be a blessing and a curse.we find the entire hotel staff to be nice , professional and courteous .<ssssss>it should be note that we do not speak spanish fluently , but thanks to lviing in can where lat-am spanish be widely speak , we be able to pick up enough of the very basics , and , together with a great spanish travel phrase book -lrb- by baron 's -rrb- , be able to fend for ourselves without problem and only rarely trouble the staff for help or info .<ssssss>when we do , there be always someone at the front desk who speak fluent english and be very helpful to we .<ssssss>another reviewer have some issue with the staff on a recent stay before mine , but we do not.with regard to the noise level , well ... madrid be one of the -- if not the most -- noisiest city in all of europe .<ssssss>without stay at a 5-star + establishment at perhaps doulbe the price , there be probably no way to totally avoid it .<ssssss>we be advise by other to ask for a room face the inside courtyard of the hotel , which we do , but be tell at check in that the hotel be fully book and no room of that type be available .<ssssss>i guess the next best location be we room face the back .<ssssss>the back street be a narrow alley-like access and not a main street with lot of foot or car traffic , thankfully , so you do not get anywhere near the same level of noise that you would get in a front face room , which i would say be to be avoid if at all possible .<ssssss>as mention , we sleep with the window open at night , which dramatically increase the noise that we do here from the back , but it be infrequent , with long period of relative quiet in between .<ssssss>the biggest noise disruption by far be the nightly garbage collection .<ssssss>they seem to go out of they way to make as much nosie as be humanly possible empty can into dumpster from hotel and restaurant to be pick up by the city truck all of which occur only in very the middle of the night .<ssssss>it really be almost beyond belief that this racket presumably go on nightly city-wide .<ssssss>the double-paned window/door do block out some of it , so keep they close if you can .<ssssss>we decide we need cooler air at night more than we need the quiet .<ssssss>interior noise from the other room in the hotel can also be a concern -lrb- there be hardwood flooring almost everywhere -rrb- .<ssssss>late one afternoon we be bother by a large group of very noisy people in the room above we , but it be a one-time occurance and only last for a short while .<ssssss>soundproofing be not this hotel 's claim to fame.but aside from all of this , the hotel 's big , big plus be its location .<ssssss>it simply can not be beat .<ssssss>the vincci soho be located in the very heart of the nice part of central mardid and be within a easy 10 to 15 min walk of almost every main tourist attraction -lrb- include the museum -rrb- or most other place that one would want to go .<ssssss>you can even walk there to/from the main rail station -lrb- atocha -rrb- .<ssssss>the mardid metro be very good , but we take it only once or twice in 3 full day because it be so close and easy to walk everywhere from this hotel.the hotel overall be a mixed bag .<ssssss>i would not recommend it for the biz traveler who have some money to stay in a more soundproof central location .<ssssss>i would also not recommend it to the budget traveler count they euro , or to someone look for more local charm and character in they surroundings -lrb- it remind I a lot of some of the w hotel in this country -rrb- .<ssssss>it be not cheap -lrb- although reasonably price for a place of this caliber and location -rrb- and as mention be very modern and sharp/hard in decor .<ssssss>certainly somewhat sterile if not cold .<ssssss>we eat dinner one night in the hotel restaurant , which be okay at best , but expensive .<ssssss>go elsewhere for much better and cheaper food -- there be ton of great place just minute away.however , all thing consider , i would highly recommend this hotel to a well seasoned european vacation traveler who be only go to be in madrid for a short while -lrb- i would not stay in this hotel , or even madrid , for longer than 3 day -rrb- and who want to be cool and close to virtually everything without a car or long and tiring walk .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 2 -1 4 -1		hilton hawaiian village - the lowdown just return from the village the resort be truly huge .<ssssss>it be not a viilage , more a town .<ssssss>it be bustling and energetic .<ssssss>after 2 week we believe we still have not discover all that it have to offer .<ssssss>but ... it be not cheap .<ssssss>to start with , we be in the rainbow tower .<ssssss>the room be ok .<ssssss>we have spend in excess of $ 1700 for a deluxe ocean view , hilton definition of a ocean view be very generous in we opinion .<ssssss>when we get to the room we look out on the condominium tower -lrb- around 50 % -rrb- the small boat harbour -lrb- around 30 % -rrb- and if you go to the balcony edge and look to the left , you could see the sea .<ssssss>we wer not happy go to the desk explain .<ssssss>they be suprise that we feel that way and be offer another room further along on the same side of the tower at $ 80 per day supplement which we decline but eventually get a room further along the tower after 5 day which have a bit better view but not a lot .<ssssss>they charge for a lot of item .<ssssss>eg , if you want to use the safe in the room it be $ 3.25 per day .<ssssss>tea/coffee/water in room be all chargeable .<ssssss>we want a umbrella 2 lounger on the beach .<ssssss>certainly for $ 51 per day .<ssssss>if you have have enough on the beach by lunchtime hilton will rent out the same equipment that they have be pay for for a full day to someone else for $ 51 for the day .<ssssss>they be rake it in from the guest .<ssssss>if you hire a car , it will cost you $ 13 per day to self park it on site $ 18 for valet parking .<ssssss>there be thing go on most night but there be no board tell you what be go on .<ssssss>there be strict rule for get towel for the beach for use the pool area but you have to find they out .<ssssss>they be not easily display .<ssssss>room service as regard cleaning in we opinion be mediocre at best .<ssssss>we be in 2 room on two different floor , so have different cleaner .<ssssss>not good at all .<ssssss>the hotel be around 1Â½ mile from waikiki so if you want to get to the heart of what be go on enjoy the place -lrb- highly recommend -rrb- , it be a taxi , bus or a walk dependant on you constitution , purse .<ssssss>it be a lovely place , but could be better if they stop try to get money out of you by the back door .<ssssss>
2 4 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		will you be the next victim ?<ssssss>this hotel have a lot of potential , but a few hiccup keep I from recommend it .<ssssss>first and foremost , you should know security do not appear to be a concern here .<ssssss>we never once see a security guard .<ssssss>anyone can walk in off the street , hop on a elevator -lrb- they be outside , so you do not even have to enter the lobby ... weird setup -rrb- and have free access to guest room .<ssssss>crook apparently know it , too .<ssssss>while we be there , we be tell a man walk into one of the room and help himself to some of the guest ' belongings .<ssssss>the maid make it easy because they clean multiple room at the same time , leave all the door wide open .<ssssss>another problem be the surly front desk staff .<ssssss>they seem horribly bother if you ask for anything in person or on the phone .<ssssss>the night clerk be the worst ... i overheard she whining about a pair of guest who have complain because they be place in a room in need of repair .<ssssss>she tell another employee , i do not have to help they .<ssssss>i do not have to do anything for they .<ssssss>i can just tell they to they need to check out and find some place else to stay .<ssssss>great .<ssssss>service with a snarl .<ssssss>also , the elevator be rickety , as previously mention , and they close without warning .<ssssss>there be some plus .<ssssss>we room be very nice and modern .<ssssss>it appear to have be recently redone .<ssssss>-lrb- the older room be on the same side of the building as the lobby , fwiw . -rrb-<ssssss>the water purifier in the bathroom be a nice touch .<ssssss>the best part of stay at the dauphine , though , be the breakfast .<ssssss>bernice put out quite a spread : fruit , pastry , cereal , yogurt , hard-boiled egg and hot and cold beverage .<ssssss>you can also make you own waffle .<ssssss>afternoon tea be ok ... hot and cold tea , plus some cheap , store-bought cookie .<ssssss>the pool be nice -lrb- and underused -rrb- , and the workout room have a good mix of equipment ... think it be a bit outdated .<ssssss>also , the hotel have recently add free wireless internet throughout the building .<ssssss>so , if the management address the security issue and the sour staff , this hotel could be a really great place to stay .<ssssss>until then , there be plenty of other option in the french quarter ...<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 3 3 3 1		like the loggiato dei serviti , with minor reservation we - british father , french mother and 25-year-old son - stay in the main building in a 3rd floor suite for 6 night with a full view of the duomo from each bed , and 75 yard from the perspex roof over the accademia 's david , for which we pay 250 euro per night include breakfast.the room be large , quiet and comfortable , as be one bathroom , the other be small , with a door badly in need of redecoration .<ssssss>the beds/mattresses be unexceptional.the season make air conditioning unnecessary , although mosquito at night be still a problem - the plug-in protector be ineffective and we be bite most night -lrb- we sleep with the window open -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel have be offer wireless internet and a terminal in the lobby for the last month or so , both of which must be pay for .<ssssss>the additional charge be petty , and waste time for both hotel staff and customer .<ssssss>we urge they to abandon it and include it in the room rate .<ssssss>in the end it be academic since neither function properly during we stay.the hotel may be slightly off center , but the center be so small that nothing that matter tourist-wise be further than a 20-minute walk .<ssssss>perhaps the most impressive feature of the hotel be the discrete lighting over the nameplate under the arcade when glimpse across the square at night .<ssssss>it do not look like a regular hotel , and this class be reflect in the subdue decoration of the interior , in particular the staircase .<ssssss>it still feel ancient monastic.there be drunk in the south corner -lrb- we be never accost or bother by they -rrb- , and a cloud of urine vapor .<ssssss>just 24 hour after the garbage truck have pass , the square , include the step up to the hotel , would be cover once again in litter -lrb- as everywhere in florence -rrb- , as if a bag of litter , in particular cigarette end , have explode over it .<ssssss>this together with the huge blue garbage bin and the scooter that would sometimes short-cut across the square -lrb- as everywhere in florence -rrb- spoil its overall appearance.a week before we arrival , we ask the hotel to make we uffizi reservation -lrb- incidentally this avoid the 18 euro or so charge by internet agency -rrb- .<ssssss>it take a second email , and over 48 hour , before the hotel acknowledge the request , but they do make the booking .<ssssss>on the other hand , on we last evening , they fail to book a cab as they would promise for the next morning , with the result that we only just make we flight.the breakfast be the standard unmemorable fare - prepacked , presliced , poured-from-a-carton whatever , with no attempt at anything specifically florentine , italian or homemade , apart from bought-in roll and croissant .<ssssss>however , they do do a cappucino if asked.on we last day we have to leave before breakfast service be start - 7.15 be - and we be not offer any replacement even though we room rate include breakfast for that day .<ssssss>as standard in italy , there be no coffee/tea facility in the room .<ssssss>at 6.15 be we ask the night porter for hot water and nescafe , only to discover that the espresso machine be already on - and he be able to make we a cappucino instead .<ssssss>we have the impression that the hotel have never think of offer this routinely to its many guest leave on early flights.we be impress by the expertise and helpfulness of one of the front desk staff , giannus lorenzinus , and by one of the breakfast staff .<ssssss>none of the other stand out.enoteca pinchiorrus : visitor tempt to try this 3-star restaurant - a 10 minute walk - should be warn that it take a particular personality to feel relax in the company of fawn suit staff - more formal than in any such restaurant we know of - a curious conception of value , and a formidable wallet : one cupful of fresh pasta with 4 teaspoon of creamy mozzarella and two thin slice of sausage , total a apparent ingredient value under 5 euro , with nothing distinctive in either taste or texture , be price at 90 euro .<ssssss>the cheapest menu with the cheapest wine , plus service , cost at least 325 euro per person , and you be unlikely to be able to enjoy yourself unless you be prepare to spend twice that .<ssssss>there be little that be recognizably italian about the menu , and what be italian - pasta and risotto - be no better , and far less generous , than in higher-end restaurant charge a quarter of the price .<ssssss>
2 1 4 4 4 3 2 -1		really disappoint the resort grounds be really beautiful , the room be spacious , and the weather be gorgeous during we stay , but that be about the best thing i can say about we experience at the biltmore .<ssssss>for a hotel property of this caliber and at this price point , i really have much higher expectation for the service that we would receive .<ssssss>the hotel seem to be extremely understaffed as we notice the same server work full shift at the pool and then also at the property 's restaurant and lounge at night .<ssssss>service be terribly slow at all of the restaurant , we wait more than 30 minute for we waiter to bring we we check one night .<ssssss>on another occassion , we server bring we we drink and when we give she exact change -lrb- include tip -rrb- , she exclaim you guy be my favorite customer because now i do not have to come back and check on you .<ssssss>we sit outside at this lounge for 5 more hour that night and she never do come back and ask we if we want another drink .<ssssss>that experience pretty much sum up we whole stay .<ssssss>i have pay 1/3 the cost at other hotel and get far better service than i get at the biltmore .<ssssss>in my opinion , this property be definitely not worth the money .<ssssss>i would return to this hotel only if the room rate be under $ 200/night .<ssssss>
5 5 4 2 3 5 5 2		excellent service i have just return from a week stay at the excellence punta cana .<ssssss>i would rate the resort itself as in above average , as the room and food be between 3?1/2 to 4 star .<ssssss>the thing that make this resort a 5 star in my opinion be the service .<ssssss>i can not say enough about the service .<ssssss>the genuine care and kindness that the hostess at the main excellence club show be impeccable -lrb- kary , fiordaliza leticia , jackeline and franklin -rrb- .<ssssss>if you stay at this resort you will have a great stay , as i state the service in great .<ssssss>i could go on and on about the people above and other within the entertainment group -lrb- ine , rey and mariel -rrb- , and other throughout the resort ; but the one above make this vacation one of best .<ssssss>i will continue to visit the resort be the property continue to employee such people as note above .<ssssss>i would also like to say a special thanks to santo from the excellence club lounge .<ssssss>so , if you be look for a great place to stay where not only the place itself be above average , but the people that they employee put the resort in a class by itselfâ ick the excellence .<ssssss>iâve already start look into date for my next visit .<ssssss>also as a note ... the food -lrb- be not to say that the food be bad -rrb- , it just that the room service a few other menu item could stand some improvement ... and the room i would guess normal wear and tear ... and the bedding can be improved/upgraded .<ssssss>

3 3 4 4 3 5 -1 2		decent choice for overnight stay i stay at this hotel overnight before a early morning flight .<ssssss>hotel be located conveniently near the main train station -lrb- less than 10 minute walk with bag -rrb- , with convenient transport to hotel -lrb- about 15 minute by train -rrb- .<ssssss>check in be pleasant , with the person at the front desk be very nice .<ssssss>the room itself be quiet and tastefully decorate , but a bit on the small side , especially consider how much i be pay .<ssssss>i also pay for they business package which give wi-fus and free movie , but the internet be s-l-o-w and my tv do not work properly .<ssssss>i choose this hotel because it be the cheapest , reasonable hotel that be accessible to the airport .<ssssss>while i would stay here again if it come to that , next time i be in frankfurt i will look for a different hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 5 2 5 1 2 3		good but thing should improve this be we last stay in a hotel during a three week 's tour through new england , before return to europe .<ssssss>and i must be honest it be the most unpleasant experience of all place we stay in .<ssssss>be this because all the other excell and this hotel do not ?<ssssss>we complain be that the front desk do not agree with a rate plan which be offer by the 2008 platinum directory of the small lead hotel of the world .<ssssss>if you like ` comedy of error ' or ` fawlty tower ' or a rude front desk go to this hotel .<ssssss>i have to phone ae before reluctantly it be agree i could have a late check out .<ssssss>but accord to the hotel continental breakfast ' which should include juice , fresh fruit etc be just some coffee in the corner next to the check in desk .<ssssss>on the other hand the hotel room be fine and spacious , the concierge be very helpfull and a complimentary car be arrange to bring we to the bmfa .<ssssss>also other at the hotel be helpful and friendly .<ssssss>but the front-desk be the face of the hotel and that seem to be forget here .<ssssss>next time we will find another hotel in boston .<ssssss>

4 3 4 5 5 3 3 4		hotel luxembourg parc -- not quite what expect i book this hotel after much research and trip advisor recommendation .<ssssss>i have every intention of loving this hotel and be surprise when i do not .<ssssss>however , would i go there again -- yes.positive :1 .<ssssss>location , location , location .2 .<ssssss>the actual building be charming -- all of the prior review be accurate to my way of think .3 .<ssssss>the staff be helpful .4 .<ssssss>the hotel be well maintain .5 .<ssssss>the breakfast be fine -- especially if it be include in you room rate.negative : there be only one -- but it do influence the way i feel about the hotel from the first minute we walk in we room .<ssssss>i have correspond at length with the hotel regard different category of room , they size , rate , etc. base on this correspondence i pick the room type that i think would work for we .<ssssss>before we be take to the room i confirm with the front desk that the room be the category i have request .<ssssss>the room be absolutely not what we have request .<ssssss>the suitcase have be bring to we room and the desk clerk be no longer available for the night .<ssssss>the next morning i do check with a different person at the front desk about this room and she confirm what the night clerk have say .<ssssss>i do not want to make a deal out of it and be the ugly american so i do not mention it again .<ssssss>on check-out we be ask to write a review for ta and that be why this be be write .<ssssss>my own experience may seem petty to other but it be not to I .<ssssss>my investment in a vacation -- of both time and money -- be valuable to I .<ssssss>in this economy i do not feel that any establishment can afford to disregard reasonable request by any guest -- especially those who have express a interest in returning.if there be a next time i will do more to guarantee that there will not be the same mix-up .<ssssss>no trip be perfect and i do not expect this to be .<ssssss>i just do expect to get what i think i have purchased.this say -- i would return to this hotel for all the positive reason state .<ssssss>
2 2 2 2 3 1 4 -1		can not recommend this hotel stay at this hotel on friday night , the weekend of a lot of conferences/conventions go on in s.f. so it be very busy .<ssssss>when we arrive , it take we about 30 minute to get to the front of the check in line and then it take another 15 minute for both check in and check out which still baffle I .<ssssss>the lobby itself look very classy .<ssssss>the lobby floor be a zoo because of the busy weekend so that be obviously not something the hotel could control .<ssssss>the hotel personnel be friendly enough and helpful when we ask question .<ssssss>the elevator could not hold many people at one time - we have people say the elevator actually stop when they put more than five people on at a time .<ssssss>the room be small as be to be expect in many hotel in s.f. the bed be comfortable the decor ok though a bit worn .<ssssss>it be the brown water that come out of the sink that take we all by surprise - that be not acceptable in my opinion .<ssssss>i do not know what the problem be but in all three of we room , the water come out brown and rusty look - be it safe to brush my tooth in it ?<ssssss>by saturday morning it seem better but that be just gross and we never hear what the problem be .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny and very old/run down - the door to the bathroom would not shut unless you slam it hard as the door do not seem to fit the frame properly .<ssssss>walk from this location on market street be not something to be do alone - we do it with a group of lady but i would not have feel safe with a smaller group .<ssssss>we luck out and get one of the very last parking spot in they gate lot that we pay $ 25 per day to have so we be actually thankful for that since it be such a busy weekend .<ssssss>the price be right for we at $ 99 a night so you probably get what you pay for in the city .<ssssss>if we be stay for any longer than one night , i would never even consider this hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 4 1 4 3 3 2		splendidly too quiet for I , though nice for the right person .<ssssss>i stay here a few month ago .<ssssss>it be my first time travel base on review from tripadvisor.comwell , i learn that i be not look for the same thing as most traveler .<ssssss>everyone seem concern with how posh and quiet it be .<ssssss>i be only 34 and when i go out of town , i want to experience the city .<ssssss>the hotel play a large part in that experience as i be always go too and from it.the neighborhood be nice , but a sleepy bedroom community , for pari that be .<ssssss>while sightseeing you have to pass all the fun community with plentiful cafe and park to come back to the splendid .<ssssss>i would have prefer a hotel in the 6th , 5th near the pantheon or ile de la cite , after visit they .<ssssss>there you have more cafe with the chair on the sidewalk in row , and art gallery and ton of unique boutique , bakery and more .<ssssss>that be say , it may be the perfect hotel for those who want peace and quiet -lrb- though there be a bar down the sidestreet , that you can hear drunk yell sometimes .<ssssss>i run to my balcony to watch , excite by the prospect of life , they be too far to see though . -rrb-<ssssss>the street have few people and no street life .<ssssss>grant , it be august.the champ be very close , but mostly just a bunch of shop i have here .<ssssss>walk through it on you way to somewhere.the arc de triomphe be close , but once you have see it ... the hotel be nice .<ssssss>i pay a little more than i want to because of the review on here .<ssssss>i would have gladly pay more for a more idealized parisian neighborhood and atmosphere .<ssssss>like on tv , and that be what you get in the other neighborhood i mentioned.i have some form of junior suite .<ssssss>walk through the door , then a little cloakroom or place to put luggage and hang coat with a door that shut it from the bedroom , then the bedroom , pretty window that seal off traffic noise , a balcony , then to the right of the bedroom be a little sit room , and off of that the bathroom , which be very nice and large for europe .<ssssss>semi-mildewy shower curtain .<ssssss>the room have a balcony and a view of a pretty cap-gemini consulting office building .<ssssss>nothing at all to look at to the left or the right.breakfast be good !<ssssss>i like it .<ssssss>not too different from other hotel i have stay at in london .<ssssss>bin with egg , bacon and sausage in one small area , and a longer table with bread , meat , cheese , fruit , cereal and beverage .<ssssss>the entire breakfast room be smaller than most master bedroom in the u.s. i look forward to breakfast as i like to see the other traveler and get my bearing for the day.there be not a bar that i notice and no place where other patron congregate or one can talk to the staff in a less formal manner.overall , a nice place , but not worth the # 8 spot on here in my opinion .<ssssss>not even close .<ssssss>tripadvisor need to come up with a better rating system besides singles , family and romance .<ssssss>
4 3 4 3 5 5 5 -1		what we expect from a hampton inn a nice hampton inn .<ssssss>be at the northern edge of the theater district mean this hotel be a little quieter than many .<ssssss>bathroom be small but attractive .<ssssss>the 11th floor -- the highest level -- be a full floor of king , non-smoking room .<ssssss>comfy mattress .<ssssss>plumbing noise through the wall , but not much else .<ssssss>-lrb- the busload of high school kid be house on the 2nd floor -- not sure how noisy that get ! -rrb-<ssssss>room face either 8th avenue or a alley with a tall building on the other side .<ssssss>the street side be a little noisier , but better view -lrb- not much view tho , when you be only 11 floor up -rrb- .<ssssss>everyone who work there who we encounter be pleasant and helpful .<ssssss>in the evening , someone be station near the elevator to make sure people go up have a room key.request a room as high up as possible and away from the ice machine .<ssssss>the include breakfast be available from 6-10am , but from 8:30 -10 , at least on weekend , the breakfast room be a polite but crowded zoo .<ssssss>get there early , even if you plan to take you juice and bagel back to you room .<ssssss>we leave we bag with the bellhop to hold between check out and the train home .<ssssss>with we aaa rate , the king room be under $ 200 a night -lrb- exclude tax -rrb- on a cold , cold january weekend .<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 4 2 1 -1		do not live up to its review just come back from a long weekend break in barcelona .<ssssss>we have a brilliant time overall but , have read all the positive review on this site for this hotel , we be disappointed , almost straight away , with the reality , as we find it .<ssssss>the hotel staff who check we in be indifferent and we room - 206 - be absolutely miniscule .<ssssss>undeterred , we venture out almost straight away to head for la rambla .<ssssss>we be prepare for the short trek to the metro station so it be not really a problem but it do become tiring by the end of the stay - somewhere more central and walker friendly would have be nicer .<ssssss>when it come to go out in that evening , we could see that there do not seem to be any restaurant close by so we ask the hotel manageress if she could recommend anywhere .<ssssss>she simply tell we that there be not anythy nearby , but that we could wait for a minute and she would get back to we - she then disappear into the office and never return !<ssssss>somehow or other , with no thanks to the hotel , we stumble upon a absolutely amazing tapa bar call bar cata 1.81 , about 5 block away , which more than make we day !<ssssss>on get back to we room , at about 11.30 pm , we just could not sleep thanks to some kind of al fresco student party go on in the appartment block next door .<ssssss>we copmlain but be tell that there be no room to swap we into .<ssssss>we try to sleep again but it get worse so complain again , and be finally tell there be a room but it be not clean so we would have to wait .<ssssss>at about 1 be we be finally move into a new room - much quieter and slightly bigger - but not what you would really call good customer service - the concierge guy seem more stressed than we about the whole thing .<ssssss>the rest of the stay be fine but we could not really shake off the bad start .<ssssss>we be not sure we would recommend it to anyone and next time , we would definitely pick somewhere more central and perhaps pay a bit more for a bigger , quieter room with friendlier staff .<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 4 -1 5 -1		hotel aprile-palazzo dal borgo we spend four night and it be a very pleasant experience .<ssssss>we be tell we be upgrade and we do have a huge bedroom , a sit room and very nice marble bath .<ssssss>very quiet .<ssssss>we have a view of the santa maria novella and bell tower .<ssssss>it be also only a few door to the famous smn farmacia-don ' t miss it .<ssssss>everyone in the hotel be very helpful and extremely kind .<ssssss>it be a easy walk to everything in the historic area and we have no problem walk by the smn square at all and never see anything to feel threaten about .<ssssss>we travel by train and it be also a easy walk to the station .<ssssss>

4 3 3 5 5 3 4 -1		good .<ssssss>the bed<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 4 5 3		design to a t all you need to know about the w seattle be that the main entrance be barely mark , and when you walk in the door there be not a check-in desk or staff member in sight .<ssssss>for the first time traveler , it be bewildering.once you realize the welcome desk be up the grand flight of stair to you left , the staff be professional and helpful , and they have you key at the ready .<ssssss>the elevator be smooth and fast , take you up the two dozen floor without effort .<ssssss>the hallway be shockingly dim in comparison to most hotel , but not enough to impede vision , and i believe it help with keep the noise down at night.the room be expertly design new york anal-retentive , and i mean that in the best possible way .<ssssss>absolutely nothing be out of place , from the tub mat to the pillow on the bed .<ssssss>there be no visible drawer , those be in the closet , along with real hanger and a second bathrobe .<ssssss>the hotel information binder have be replace by a stack of card bind on a large brad , which keep the size down .<ssssss>there be no phone book , because that would require a drawer , though there be a flat panel television with high-definition content .<ssssss>the finishing be not exactly luxurious in the traditional sense but they be attractive , and everything in the room match just so .<ssssss>the bed , sheet , and towel be all top quality .<ssssss>you would not be at all ashamed to have this as you guest room , even if you live in a much nicer house than i do.the price be high .<ssssss>$ 36 to park , $ 15 for internet in the room , $ 20 +3.50 for delivery and a 22 % service fee for a omelette can quickly turn a w stay into a extremely expensive proposition .<ssssss>thankfully the staff recommend the excellent pastry shop across the street where there be parisian-quality croissant and good coffee .<ssssss>the location be right in the center of downtown , though the proximity to the convention center mean there be not many of the smaller restaurant that one might find in another city.in summary , the w be a beautiful , expensive hotel with great service that be perhaps not the most practical , especially if you have get a family with you .<ssssss>still , if you stay at the w you know what kind of experience you be get .<ssssss>

2 2 4 5 4 3 1 4		not come back to lenox when i be live in boston as a college student almost two decade ago , i never really notice the lenox at the corner of boylston and exeter , even though i live just 5 minute away -lrb- on foot -rrb- from it .<ssssss>it be a rather low key property.during this last trip , after read a fodor 's review , i decide to stray from the safer choice of ritz-carlton and fourseason , to try out this low-key , charming , historic property.indeed , the hotel be architecturally nostalgically charming , but it be not in tip top physical condition .<ssssss>as a previous reviewer have note , the hotel be a little faded.what be most unimpressive , however , be the service .<ssssss>almost all of the hotel 's staff seem to hate they job ; they rarely smile .<ssssss>while they be not particularly rude , they service attitude be grouchy at best and be not particularly helpful when ask for travel advice and/or recommendation .<ssssss>the doorman 's daily dose of smart comment be also particularly annoying .<ssssss>on the morning of the second day of we stay , we spill some moisturizing lotion on the bedcover .<ssssss>we leave the soil part of the bedcover face up on the floor next to the bed .<ssssss>when we return that evening , we find that the chambermaid have not clean the lotion off of the bedcover and have simply put the bedcover on the bed face down , with the lotion now soil the sheet .<ssssss>this be particularly disturbing.lenox also go overboard with its environmental activism .<ssssss>it encourage guest , to the point of almost force it on they , not to change bath towel or bedsheet daily , in the interest of save the environment .<ssssss>bed sheet be change once in 3 day , but guest be not inform beforehand .<ssssss>i only find out on the last day of my 3-night stay when i find a card hide in a bedside table drawer tell guest that the lenox be concern about the environment and would only change sheet once in 3 day , unless request otherwise .<ssssss>guest should be notify of this when they check in , not through a card hide in a drawer .<ssssss>all this environmental activism seem more like a ploy to reduce operating cost to I .<ssssss>it be a real shame that they have to use the mask of environmental activism to achieve this.one more tip for those who rent/bring car with they : while car valet at the lenox be free during the day , the hotel charge $ 38 for overnight parking .<ssssss>there be several car garage in the vicinity that charge less than half that for overnight parking .<ssssss>otherwise , if you be a early riser , just park overnight in the street for free .<ssssss>however , traveler should note when street cleaning day be , during which day , parking between 6am and 8am be not allow .<ssssss>also , free street parking end daily at 8am mon-sat , so you would either have to move you car and valet it for free at the lenox , or feed the parking meters.my recommendation : stay at some other hotel while in boston .<ssssss>for a truly charming historic hotel , with great service , if budget be not a issue , try the ritz-carlton in newburry st would be my top choice .<ssssss>another boston hotel with great service : fourseason boston .<ssssss>if look for a hotel in the vicinity of the lenox , try marriott or westin at copley .<ssssss>for a less expensive alternative in the vicinity , try the colonnade in huntington ave.<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		fantastic hotel !<ssssss>especially for shopping and sightseeing !<ssssss>i stay in this hotel just before christmas and find it excellent .<ssssss>it be very clean and the room be really cool especially the bathroom .<ssssss>we have no problem with noise so much so we keep sleep in .<ssssss>it be great for shopping and sightseeing as you be so close by that you can drop back to the hotel throughout the day to freshen up or drop off any purchase you have make .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and go to great effort to help we choose a restaurant despite out terrible lack of spanish !<ssssss>also the hotel have free internet access which be a great help .<ssssss>in response to the complaint make by the trip advisor member from ny - not be able to drink the water be standard over most of europe and the hotel can not be blame - also if you want to watch tv i would not advise fly half way around the world to barcelona to do it !<ssssss>
3 3 4 4 4 5 4 1		reliable choice this hotel be in a nice location and the room be very clean and comfortable .<ssssss>the hotel staff be accomodate and check-in be a pleasant experience , even at midnight .<ssssss>the only complaint that i have be that the hotel be currently undergo construction -lrb- which they do warn I about -rrb- and so get from lobby level to you floor be somewhat of a challenge .<ssssss>we have to take a elevator to floor 4 , walk around the corner , and take another elevator on up to higher floor .<ssssss>the same go for go back down , and the wait for the elevator be sometimes long as everyone be try to figure out how to get from point a to point b. other than that , the experience be fine .<ssssss>nothing special .<ssssss>oh and also , charge for internet access in the room -lrb- not even wireless -rrb- be a bit silly , especially for a business-friendly hotel .<ssssss>
3 2 2 2 5 3 2 5		no hot water bravo beach be okay .<ssssss>this be not the side of the island to stay on .<ssssss>the beach be rocky and unswimmable and not blue .<ssssss>i want to love the hotel .<ssssss>i like the decor and the aveda product , but for $ 300 plus a night we do not get any hotwater .<ssssss>i tell the front desk immediately that we do not have any .<ssssss>they send a repairman who inform we that the hotwater heater suck and there be nothing he could do !<ssssss>so we spend we entire time there without a hot shower .<ssssss>not cool !!!<ssssss>the food at the restaurant be super expensive .<ssssss>i do not get any type of discount for the inconvenience of no hot water .<ssssss>i ask and do not receive .<ssssss>i would not stay here again .<ssssss>i recommend that you stay on the other side of the island !!<ssssss>
3 1 2 -1 2 -1 4 -1		average hotel , expensive the lobby of the stanford court be beautiful - a nice place to hang out get a feel of what san fran use to feel like year in the past .<ssssss>after view the lobby i expect more grand thing in we room and be disappoint .<ssssss>the room be fine - it be clean nice but it smell like a antique store ; old .<ssssss>the hotel be definitely a older hotel in need of some upgrade .<ssssss>the bathroom look like it would last be renovate in the 1960 's , but be otherwise clean .<ssssss>what have room for improvement be the price of all the incidental at this hotel .<ssssss>the drink price in the lobby bar , the room service price and the parking be highway robbery .<ssssss>beware : they only offer valet parking -lrb- there be no self-parking available and accord to the front desk , none nearby . -rrb-<ssssss>the only alternative be street parking , which be meter .<ssssss>i suppose if we would have want to walk several block we could have find self-parking , but since we be in the city to go to the opera and a nice dinner we be not exactly in walk attire .<ssssss>the total bill for one night of valet parking be $ 46.74 include tax .<ssssss>if we would be tell it be that much up front we could have find cheaper parking take bart or a quick taxi ride back to the hotel and save money .<ssssss>i know san fran be not know for its inexpensive parking , but we feel almost $ 47/night be just a little much .<ssssss>overall , if the stanford court be to remodel its hotel it would seem more reasonable to pay the high price , but with its current condition we feel theyâre a bit overpriced .<ssssss>it be worth note that we pay a discounted rate for we room , otherwise if we would have pay $ 200 + night we would have only give the hotel 1-star .<ssssss>
1 4 1 -1 2 -1 1 -1		dump !<ssssss>this place be pathetic !<ssssss>the room be so musty that i be sure to see mold grow on the wall .<ssssss>the furniture be 70s , the carpet be worn-out , and the down comforter be never clean - i stay here every week for work unfortunately .<ssssss>be stay at the park hyatt down the street -lrb- which be awesome -rrb- but have to switch because this place be $ 15 cheaper - company policy.i receive 10,000 starwood point the first week i stay because of the filthy room .<ssssss>the breeze restaurant be really bad - they charge my room for somebody els meal and the front desk would not take it off even though they have a copy of the bill with somebody else 's name clearly print on it .<ssssss>the service -- !<ssssss>they always have 1 or 2 people check in 30 guest on monday nights.the gym charge $ 12 -lrb- free if you platinum or $ 6 if you be gold -rrb- .<ssssss>starwood prefer guest get no preferential treatment .<ssssss>the valet parking be a ripoff -lrb- again it be cheaper at the hyatt down the road -rrb- .<ssssss>really bad hotel !<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 1 3 3 -1		watch out !<ssssss>i figure i have no reason to worry about the hotel as i enter the lobby .<ssssss>it look ok and the staff be pleasant .<ssssss>i be give my room that seem to be in a different building than the lobby as i have to tread through a indoor walkway before reach it.at first glance the room seem ok , but as i enter i realize that it stink like a pot-party have just leave minute ago .<ssssss>lampshade with hole in they , wallpaper tear in some area .<ssssss>i open the window just to be meet by a view of two disco-ball and light -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>hang between the hotel and the next building and i have to make a choice of either get rid of the stench or be keep awake by the noise from the club own the discoball .<ssssss>i opt for the latter as it be no a/c nor change of air in the room .<ssssss>the bathroom be spacious , but there be a lot of chip in the tub -lrb- no , not the potato-kind ... -rrb- and the showercurtain be heavily milldewed.you might ask why i do not ask for a new room .<ssssss>at the same time i be there , a international broadcasting conference be in town , occupy all that could be find of room in amsterdam.the worst bit be when i lay down to try and go to sleep in the stench and noise from the club outside my window .<ssssss>the matress act like a hammock would , make I feel like i try sleep in a miniature meteorite-crater .<ssssss>do i mention that i find paperclip -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>under the covers?my colleague that stay in a different part of the hotel get a totally different room and be very pleased - so when book ; watch out and try and beware that there might be a heaven-and-hell difference when it come to the room-standard .<ssssss>
2 1 1 4 2 1 1 3		self park valet , and cold shoulder at the desk i decide to roll the dice on this trip .<ssssss>try to save a few $ 's do not pay off here .<ssssss>i have to find a place to stay in la , and my budget be tighter than usual , so i book the 3 star , instead of the 4 star .<ssssss>i have learn over the year that the star rating be one of the most inaccurate bellwether in existence ... this be a perfect case in point .<ssssss>the only parking option be valet which be really a self park , with no bag help -lrb- human or cart -rrb- up to the obstacle course entry way .<ssssss>this will cost you $ 20 a day .<ssssss>if you book online , but not through they , you get the pleasure of be tell that despite you prepaid reservation , there be no normal room to be have .<ssssss>the wheelchair accessible room will have to suffice , because you have prepaid.then you see the room 's condition , view , and noise level .<ssssss>to put it nicely , the room have a nice look bed , surround by dirt trash furnishings .<ssssss>take the bed away and you have get a room with half work light , broken fixture and a window that look out onto a giant ashtray .<ssssss>to top it off , there be no shortage of reminder that despite the view of the butt , this be a smoke free hotel !<ssssss>skip it unless you pay less than $ 50 and do not have a car with you .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 5 4 5 3		excellent location the pro : the mosser be conveniently located near shop and restaurant , in addition to bus stop that take you to fisherman 's wharf and golden gate bridge .<ssssss>the room be clean.the con : the room be very small .<ssssss>there be no sink in the bathroom -lrb- which be mention in other people ' review of the mossier -rrb- .<ssssss>the sink be in the corner of the bedroom .<ssssss>the noise level can be a little high at time .<ssssss>we be able to hear other hotel patron walk in the hall .<ssssss>the bed size seem slightly larger than a full size bed , so if you be use to queen or king size bed , this place be not for you .<ssssss>however , in my opinion the pro outweigh the con !!!<ssssss>i would definitely stay there again and would recommend people on a budget to stay there as well .<ssssss>
1 2 1 -1 3 -1 1 -1		utterly disgraceful not be a person who usually complain i would just like to say that my stay in the meriton world tower appartment be my worst experience ever in any hotel i have be to anywhere in the world .<ssssss>i be extremely disappoint after look forward to this accomodation so much .<ssssss>we have problem after problem and not a single apology from any member of staff .<ssssss>there on the 3rd night of my honeymoon , my wife and i be make to feel utterly insignificant and not the least bit valued!we would have overlook any of we problem individually but we have so many it be disgraceful .1 .<ssssss>we be tell there be only one key for the appartment , the other have be break -lrb- not a problem in itself but read on -rrb- 2 .<ssssss>we be ` not ' tell that when we open we appartment door there would be two room , a a and a b. when i open room b -lrb- not know which be ours -rrb- i find there be already a person there asleep on the sofa .<ssssss>this be not we room yet we key open the door !!<ssssss>3 .<ssssss>when i go to speak to someone at reception about this -lrb- clearly worry that other people could also get into we room -rrb- i be tell ` oh that would be so and so , he be alright , he be be here 10months .

2 2 2 5 3 3 4 1		too small for too much money the pro of this hotel : relatively convenient to amtrak train station ; very convenient to the hyne convention center t , shopping , and eating ; the staff be very friendly ; free wi-fus and computer in lobby ; starbuck coffee in room and in lobby ; pool and exercise room very nice -lrb- complete with sauna and locker room -rrb- con : the room be super tiny ; we room back up to a elevator , which be noisy all night , bathroom be very small as well ; we shower have crack tile and grout with mold/mildew in it ; housekeeping come at random time during the day , so we never know when they would show up ; wire internet be $ 10/day ; pool deck poorly design and be very slippery border on a lawsuit wait to happen.if you be travel alone and attend a function at the convention center , i would recommend this place .<ssssss>but if you have get more than one person in you room , you should look elsewhere .<ssssss>there be four of we in that tiny space , and it be hard on all of we .<ssssss>we keep hear the elevator all night .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 3 3 1 1		beautiful location ... sub par ammenity and service this hotel have just open when we visit , and in my opinion they open prematurely .<ssssss>the property be nice , however there be quite a few issue that we encounter from the minute we arrive .<ssssss>they only have one elevator operable , and it be almost always fill with workman that be finish detail on the hotel .<ssssss>so , we often have to hike up to the 7th floor where we room be located , or wait for 10 minute for a ride up .<ssssss>the fitness center that be advertise , do not exist - and it be a major debacle ask the hotel to assist with find a facility to use nearby .<ssssss>the internet be not work , so it be impossible to get any work do during we stay .<ssssss>and forget about get a cab - we call a half hour ahead to ask for assistance with a taxi , and it take a additional 20 minute after the time we have specify .<ssssss>the hotel room be also without hot water from time to time over we 3 night stay .<ssssss>there be lot of blank stare from the staff when we approach they with the issue we encounter .<ssssss>-lrb- i be cut they come slack wth this review because they be newly open . -rrb-<ssssss>the entire experience be a mess ... and to be honest we would have check out immediately after we check in , but we be there for a wedding and do not want to offend the bride and groom .<ssssss>as a frequent traveler , i would highly recommend the pan pacific or any other high end hotel in the area for business or leasure over the arctic club .<ssssss>go have a drink at the bar if you want to check out the place - the bartender be the highlight of the experience for we group .<ssssss>
3 2 3 2 4 4 5 2		not worth five star i spend two night at this rather unimpressive hilton .<ssssss>the location be not near the interesting tourist area nor any of several international conference center , but do have a convenient metro nearby .<ssssss>the staff be uniformly nice , helpful and able to communicate in english-this be really the best feature of the hotel .<ssssss>the lobby be very nice , but elevator small and not always work .<ssssss>the room be small but ok size for european standard , but in need of renovation , or at least painting .<ssssss>no iron or other useful amenity in room , very expensive internet access -lrb- 23 euro daily for mediocre connection -rrb- .<ssssss>the bathroom be clean and everything work well .<ssssss>the bed be not bad , but not one of the best , although several nice pillow help .<ssssss>no pool and tiny ill-equipped gym .<ssssss>the breakfast be include in my package but be more appropriate for a 2-3 star hotel-bad weak coffee and limited , below average quality buffet .<ssssss>pricy , uninteresting lunch and dinner menu , which i do not try , but meal at meeting not high quality .<ssssss>overall , not so bad for the brief meeting i attend , but i would choose somewhere else .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 2 -1 3 -1		a bit worn but reasonable value for money if you be fairly easy go , not too fussy and dont plan on stay in you room for any length of time then this hotel warrant consideration .<ssssss>rather old and tired in most place but it be clean .<ssssss>not too long a walk to the beach or main part of waikiki .<ssssss>tiny pool but it will cool you down .<ssssss>if you be on a tight budget and want to be reasonably close to beach etc. then this could be the place for you .<ssssss>if you have a little more money to splurge with then another hotel might suit you better .<ssssss>

3 3 5 4 5 3 3 -1		the average atenea mar we stay here for three day while we be in barcelona .<ssssss>the room be small , but we be lucky enough to get 2 adjoining room for all four of we .<ssssss>the room be very cheery and posh , and seem very futuristic as well .<ssssss>i also like it that you have to put you room key into the slot in the entryway to activate the electricity .<ssssss>the hotel be in walk distance of a beach .<ssssss>hotel employee be very nice , and fix we issue with we room key -lrb- it do take two time to get it fix , though -rrb- .<ssssss>they speak excellent english.the bed be very nice , though since we get a second room floor -lrb- 1st floor in european -rrb- that face the street , we hear a lot of the street noise.taking a shower be harder than i expect , as when i try to turn up the heat on the shower , it either become too hot , or when i try to make the water cool , it become too cool .<ssssss>-lrb- there be another person in we party take a shower the same time as i be in the other room , which mean that both shower must have be connect to one water source -rrb- .<ssssss>the restaurant at the hotel for lunch be average : service , food , atmosphere , and so on .<ssssss>i do , however , recommend the hotel restaurant for they buffet breakfast .<ssssss>very delicious , with different drink , various meat , and breakfast food .<ssssss>tv have 3 english channel : cnn international , fox news -lrb- yes , from america -rrb- and bbc world .<ssssss>
2 3 3 4 2 4 5 -1		caveat emptor i will not bear you with the restaurant and room description ; suffice to say it be a swanky place overall , and the staff , to a person , be friendly and courteous .<ssssss>but be aware of one caveat : after arrive late at night , and settle in to we non-smoking room , on a non-smoking floor , i be awaken to a great deal of noise from the room next door .<ssssss>step into the hall , i note a sign for a son 's 21st birthday party on the room door , with people come and go , and cigarette smoke billow from the room , along with numerous cigarette butt on the floor .<ssssss>take a trip downstairs to bring this to the attention of the night manager , i be assure that they would do something if it get out of hand and it be really just a small family event .<ssssss>three hour later , around 3 am , they must have finally get around to do something about it , as the noise subside , and the family , -lrb- remarkable in have so many young girl with a nearly identical preference for skimpy clothing , high heel and excess make-up -rrb- , finally stop they traffic in and out of the hotel room .<ssssss>later conversation with worker in the hotel yield the real datum : it be not at all uncommon for the hotel to allow party in room designate for sleep , even if the room wind up trash .<ssssss>apparently , money talk .<ssssss>since i do not know the specifics of the franchise business model for the hyatt in singapore , i can not say whom the fault for the questionable policy of allow party in hotel room next to those use for sleep lie with : the hotel manager , the franchise owner , or the hyatt company themselves .<ssssss>but i do know if you be expect a quiet night sleep , or a relatively smoke free room in this hotel , buyer beware .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 4 4 -1		good service , but disappointed with room i stay in the swissotel , follow review on this site .<ssssss>while the staff be efficient in the sign-in , sign-out process , i do encounter a few thing that make my stay less enjoyable .<ssssss>the first problem be the room size .<ssssss>the room be unexpectedly small .<ssssss>some website give the swissotel 5 star , but this be not accurate .<ssssss>the room be design so there be just barely enough space on either side of the bed for I to move around in .<ssssss>when you look at the photo post on the hotel 's website , the room display be quite deceptive ; the actual room look about 2/3rd the size .<ssssss>the study desk be small , and clutter with all the hotel information-related reading materials.the second problem be the bed .<ssssss>the mattress be uncomfortably firm , and i have a difficult time sleep on it .<ssssss>it be nothing compare to the other bed use in hotel like sheraton .<ssssss>-lrb- i.e. the heavenly bed -rrb- .<ssssss>it take I over 2 hour to fall asleep on these bed .<ssssss>a third problem be the room service .<ssssss>if you need any item from room service -lrb- for example a toothbrush -rrb- , it take about a hour for room service to have it deliver , which i think be unusually long .<ssssss>so in summary , the stay be a bit on the disappointing side , and i probably would not stay in this hotel again .<ssssss>it be * not * a 5 star hotel , but more accurately , a 4 star .<ssssss>
2 2 2 1 4 4 3 -1		with noise like this , who could relax ??<ssssss>i stay at the ilikai in december after complete the marathon .<ssssss>the room be nice - decor be warm , bedding and furniture very comfy and it be great to have a full kitchen .<ssssss>but ... .<ssssss>with construction right outside we room during the day and a large air conditioning unit during the night , we do not have a pieceful time at all !<ssssss>also , the wall and door be so thin that we hear everyone who walk by we room - especially with the two inch gap underneath the door , which we have to muffle with a bathtowel .<ssssss>i would not recommend this hotel if you want to relax in hawaii !!!<ssssss>
4 2 5 4 5 5 5 5		really cool place !<ssssss>we decide to book a room at the drake because of all the feedback we get from the review .<ssssss>the review be pretty much acurate .<ssssss>clean and really vintage look but modern at the same time .<ssssss>it be a weird combo that seem to work .<ssssss>we be very excite about be able to come back from a concert and be able to chill and have a drink at one of the 3 facilities/clubs in the hotel ... however , sure enough a week before we arrive we get a e-mail say that all facility would not be available due to some stupid green event .<ssssss>disapoint be a understatement .<ssssss>what really irk we be that we room be still super expensive without the add benefit of use bar and dining area .<ssssss>although we feel like give the place a worst rating we still believe that when all the amenity be available this be probably a great place to hang out .<ssssss>we just feel on a personal level that we get the short end of the stick.great people though at check in !<ssssss>we might give it another chance some day .<ssssss>

2 3 2 4 4 1 2 1		problem w / degli orafi great location , right around the corner from the uffizi .<ssssss>but for a 4-star hotel , you get 2-star service .<ssssss>the front desk could not locate we reservation when we arrive and make we wait around for over a hour .<ssssss>a better hotel would have just check we in w / we credit card and deal w / the hotel voucher on they own time .<ssssss>we ask the front desk to reserve we a table at trattoria sostanza the follow evening , which they say they would do and that if there be any problem they would let we know asap .<ssssss>sure enough , when we get to the restaurant , the restaurant manager do not have we reservation .<ssssss>when we call the hotel to help resolve the issue , the woman who answer the phone be the one who do not make the reservation and quickly put we on hold .<ssssss>someone else pick up the phone and say the woman who book the reservation be not work that evening .<ssssss>-lrb- fortunately , the rest .<ssssss>mgr .<ssssss>take pity on we and give we a table . -rrb-<ssssss>when i ask for a 2nd key , the front desk be experience technical difficulty , which i guess never get resolve , since they never provide I a key .<ssssss>we have problem w / we room circuit breaker , b/c the tv and electricity would go out every 10 mins. , which be correct by housekeeping .<ssssss>we stay there for 3 nights.the upside be that we do get a better room -lrb- mainly b/c they run out of room while they make we wait -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel housekeeping be quite good .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 5 1 1 -1		great location ... but , this be a great hotel for the location !!<ssssss>i recommend any family or anyone interested in be right by most hollywood attraction stay here even if it be a little more expensive.however , we do have a very difficult time get we room .<ssssss>2?1/2 hour we wait .<ssssss>we check in at 3 and finally at 5:30 after we have be to the desk every 30 minute after 4 p.m. ... they say oh , its ready .<ssssss>we have be offer to down grade at the same expense and they could give we another room with a rollaway .<ssssss>now , check the rate of this hotel and see if you would like to sleep on a rollaway!as soon as we arrive we be ask to shop for a hour while we room be finish .<ssssss>we be not happy about that , but agreeable and ask where to go and how to get there .<ssssss>so at 4 we return and it still be not ready , that clerk ask about the rollaway and that it take a hour and half to clean a room not just a hour .<ssssss>so we be ask again to go shop ... we decline and say we would sit in the lounge area not too far away .<ssssss>4:30 come and go with no word on the room .<ssssss>i go back to the desk because we would become invisible to all but the bellman who keep glance at we while everyone else check in and head up merrily to they room .<ssssss>the new desk clerk say sorry , it should not be much longer .<ssssss>5 p.m. -lrb- really 8 p.m. at home and in we brain and stomach -rrb- still no room and the desk clerk call housekeeping and someone would physically go check on the room and see how it be come .<ssssss>she assure I she would come get I and let I know either way how it be go ... ready or not .<ssssss>apparently she leave at 5 , so left without get I or tell I anything .<ssssss>she do tell we we room be a upgrade so she would not change it if it be she ... so not sure how the previous clerk think a rollaway would be a great idea .5:30 , still no one come to tell we anything and i go back to the desk ... this time get a room or we be leave ... and be tell you room be ready .<ssssss>guess they do not feel the need to come get we and tell we .<ssssss>there be no exceptional service at this hotel , no out of the way thing do but we also do not ask for anything .<ssssss>my goal after check in be to never talk to anyone at the front desk again since 3 of the clerk i would already meet be no help .<ssssss>i will say that it be a very clean hotel , very nice and you can not beat the location .<ssssss>we shuttle bus driver from the airport state the same thing that we have choose the best hotel in hollywood for access .<ssssss>

1 1 2 3 3 1 1 2		dishonest hotel there be much better hotel for better deal out there .<ssssss>do not stay here.biggest problem : hidden charge , combine with a very rude front desk .<ssssss>you think you get a good deal , but then you find that they will charge you for thing which they never disclose upfront .<ssssss>and no air conditioning.for example , i know some hotel charge for local call , many do not , so before place a call , i go through the which they in-room hotel information which tell you all about how to dial a outside line and place call , and it do not list any charge or fee for such call .<ssssss>i be shock upon checkout , when i find a huge bill for the local phone call i make .<ssssss>i would not have dial they have i know they would charge I such ghastly amount !<ssssss>when i ask for a explanation , or to see the hotel fee in write , the rude retort i recieved be we be in germany , not america .<ssssss>we do not have to disclose we fee .<ssssss>now pay or i will call the police.anyhow , it feel very underhanded , lure people into service and then charge they fee that be undisclosed beforehand , and then they attitude about about what they do be ok .<ssssss>they brag about be 4 star , but be far from it .<ssssss>no airconditioning .<ssssss>i have to choose between stifing heat or open my window for everyone to peer in and for mosquito to fly in and have a feast .<ssssss>the room be small and cramped , the shower do not even have a full shower curtain - the bathroom be soak after my shower .<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 2 2 2 3		i still like the property but it need work we stay at this hotel six year ago and absolutely love it .<ssssss>although i still really like the riu property , they clearly have not touch the hotel in the six year since we have be there .<ssssss>the hotel lobby as well as the room look shabby - though let 's face it you do not spend much time in the room anyway .<ssssss>what be more disappointing be the lack of a kid program .<ssssss>six year ago before i have kid - they have a wonderful program - although they still advertise that they have a kid program-they do not and when i ask about it - i feel like i be bother the hotel employee - i guess that they get try of my ask because one day they do take my daughter and two other child for a hour and half - when my daughter return she have a piece of paper that the staff have draw a flower on and my daugher have color in - it also seem that the activity staff be more interested -lrb- particularly the female staff -rrb- in flirt with other staff then anything else -- i would go back because i do like property but i will definitely have lower expectation next time .<ssssss>
3 2 4 2 4 4 4 -1		not impressed we just return from 2 night at the hampton inn in seattle .<ssssss>the hotel be average and we room be clean .<ssssss>the breakfast do get crowd the later you go down , but you can ask for a cardboard tray and take you goody back up to you room .<ssssss>two thing make we stay less than exciting : 1 -rrb- the street noise , and 2 -rrb- the neighborhood .<ssssss>the street noise - we 1 bedroom suite face 5th avenue on the 5th floor .<ssssss>there be constant street noise from 7 be to 11 pm .<ssssss>there be some bus stop right across the street and the bus be come and go all day .<ssssss>in addition the street be well travel by what sound like party go pedestrian .<ssssss>it be impossible to leave the window open at night with all the noise .<ssssss>do i mention the loud belch that we hear at 11 in the morning?the neigborhood , or lack thereof - we be travel with we six year old son and do not find any of the good restaurant within walk distance .<ssssss>there be homeless people to walk by on the way to downtown/space needle and we walk by 2 man and they cloud of pot smoke just a block from the hotel in the middle of the afternoon .<ssssss>i guess this would seem like a better hotel if we want to drive everywhere and be heavy sleeper -lrb- or a bit hard of hearing -rrb- .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 2 1		nice hotel in bali stay here for my last 5 night of my balus trip and think i would see what nusa dua have to offer.went through accor hotel website and get a deal for 79 we dollar no change no cancellation no refund.the hotel be situate next to many other resort style hotel in nusa dua and look quite impressive on arrival.the check in be quite slow and at first i think i have get the wrong novotel as it have only be book over the web a hour previously and the staff be unsure whether i be book in.eventually book in and go to my hotel room which you have to cross the road to get to but once inside the room i be impress the room be a very large size with a nice balcony to sit outside and relax.the bathroom be very clean and a nice size all you could ask for really.the hotel have a buffet themd night each evening to be honest never try it as it didnt look very good value for money so i eat most night in the beach bar and the food be very good the pizza be excellent and they do a mean kebab.the beach attach to the hotel be very good when the tide come in but at low tide didnt look too impressive.if you be a watersport fan you will not be dissapointed and look quite reasonable.tried the internet in my room and be charge around Â£8 for 24 hour use and as the connection speed be slow this be definitely not worth the money you would be far better off go to a local internet cafe and log on there.overall the hotel be very good but not very good for a single traveller as there be not much to do in the evening and much prefer the hustle and bustle of tuban and kuta as this seem to be more of the real balus and its people<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 2 2 4 1		amazin location , amazing staff but wrong managment and planning i stay with my family for 7 day at the rydge .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we have the family room which be two room and a bathroom , it be nice and clean .<ssssss>.<ssssss>avrage room nothin really spicial .<ssssss>the staff be soo nice and helpful , but there be alot of mistake we have have , first of all the room service once enter the room without knockin the door which be soo weird i mean even 1 star hotel wouldnt do that , and then when i ask for room service they didnt really clean the room .<ssssss>.<ssssss>like they only clean the floor and change the main bed 's sheet , , but they didnt do the other room , i think rydge get amazing location but they need new idea to make the hotel more intersting and also to care about the littel stuff that make people happy because really even littel thing matter when it come to customer and the hotel .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i would stay again at the rydges.thank youneil george<ssssss>

2 2 4 3 3 5 2 3		a waisted vacation if you like ; - motor boat , seadoo 's , parasail , gasoline smell , helicopter tour over you head , swim in oil leak , noise and air pollution at the beach .<ssssss>- get up at 6am to secure a chair at the beach or pool .<ssssss>- wait standing in line 90 minute to get into one of the 4 restaurant -lrb- always only half full -rrb- .<ssssss>- ask 6 time at the buffet for water -lrb- and not get any -rrb- .<ssssss>- feel like you be at work .<ssssss>- feel like a ` airline ' customer.this place be for you ... positive side ; - new and very nice installation .<ssssss>- morning buffet be very good with competent staff .<ssssss>- management be try to make it better but seam to use the ` trial error ' approach on solve problems.conclusion ; do not like it , will not go back and will not recommend it .<ssssss>this $ 6k school break vacation with my family be a total waste .<ssssss>
1 1 1 1 3 2 1 3		no air conditioning in room !!!<ssssss>do not underestimate this !!!<ssssss>this hotel do not have work air-conditioning .<ssssss>we be travel with 2 other couple and all three room be the same ... very hot !<ssssss>the picture on the website only reflect the most expensive room in the hotel .<ssssss>the other room be outdate and old !<ssssss>the bar area outside be nice but do not make you stay more comfortable .<ssssss>for the price , not a good value !<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 3 4 2 4		it be fair advantage : * room be pretty spacious * room be also clean * wide variety of breakfast * shower heaterdisadvantage : * hair dryer be collect when room be make up by housekeeping so you have to wait for another staff to bring back the hair dryer when you need it * you can only borrow one adapter .<ssssss>there be 3 of we in the room so we have to equally divide the time of charge we phone , digital camera , ipod .<ssssss>so thats i think approximately 1 hour per electronic gadget .<ssssss>* we room didnt have lcd tv contrary to what be indicate on they website * no cable .<ssssss>there be only one channel with american show * the shower head wasnt stable and you have to keep adjust its position so that water wouldnt go outside the bath tub * staff werent helpful when it come to carry you luggage .<ssssss>i just buy a lcd monitor -lrb- 21.6 inch -rrb- from the mall and the bell boy only watch I while i carry it .<ssssss>
4 3 2 5 4 4 4 -1		really good but not quite number one in london once install , this hotel really have a great location .<ssssss>you can walk almost anywhere .<ssssss>but get to and from the hotel in a taxi can be difficult .<ssssss>the back street of soho be not easy to negotiate in a taxi at any time of the day.the hotel have great staff ; very friendly and professional .<ssssss>and the room be very nicely decorate with well stock bathroom and minus bar .<ssssss>but - for a new hotel - the soundproofing be dreadful .<ssssss>the street noise be not a problem but noise from other room and the corridor can be appalling .<ssssss>the room would really benefit from a small hallway or double door or better sound installation or something to prevent you be wake up in the small hour by a neighbour try to unlock they door or take a very early morning shower or a trolley trundle along a corridor .<ssssss>the restaurant and bar be fine but not outstanding and the food be acceptable without be brilliant .<ssssss>all in all , i would be tempt back for the location but doubt whether i would go back until they have cure the noise problem .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 4 2 1 1		awful be a kimpton customer expect to find a better place .<ssssss>we have reserve a suite which turn out to be a large room separate with a tacky curtain as a division .<ssssss>the tv control remote do not work .<ssssss>wireless internet connection didnt work either.we pay $ 46 for two coffee and bagel room service breakfast , which arrive 30 minute late.on we departure date , have to catch a early flight , we have request room service at 6,00 am and after several call it finally arrive at 6,45 am .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 5 3 3 4		if you do not like to walk , do not go here the hotel be a very clean place , the biggest problem be the walking and then there be try to get reservation for the ala carte restaurant ... they tell you to phone between 9 pm and 11 pm for the next day , but most of the time they do not answer the phone , try call at 2pm for the same evening work alot better for us.when go on the flee market scene on the beach go to the green mall ... they be alot more willing to barter then the first 4 or 5 store .<ssssss>the flee market that happen on the resort be very expensive ... not very good deal at all.all in all the resort be good the alcohol be not .<ssssss>the people you meet there from all over the world be awesome , but i will not be go back to this particular resort.stacie<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 2 3 3 2		not a good experience this hotel use to be a monastery .<ssssss>the lighting be activate by you body heat and last for approximately 30 seconds .<ssssss>this leave you walk along a narrow dark corridor , dark beam in the ceiling .<ssssss>many dark door on either side of you reminiscent of the monastery cell .<ssssss>the room be quite clean and have french window .<ssssss>bathroom be nearly clean but not quite.cold breakfast be ok - tea ok for one cup , coffee disgusting .<ssssss>hot breakfast - scramble egg that have see better day .<ssssss>the hotel be approx 50 metre from the middle of the ramblas - be careful when return to it at night .<ssssss>there be homless and vagrant in the square outside the hotel from early morning .<ssssss>these guy keep themselves to themselves and do not bother you - i think the church in the square provide food for they .<ssssss>hotel staff be very nice .<ssssss>we be overcharge for we stay - may bank holiday .<ssssss>only reason i would go back to this hotel be if it be extremely cheap .<ssssss>
4 4 2 4 4 2 2 3		nice , but not 5-star this be a beautiful hotel in a great location , with decent service and so-so room .<ssssss>if/when i travel to bali i would definitely consider book here again , but will look closer.the hotel grounds be beautiful .<ssssss>we stay in a garden room with a stunning view of the lush garden on the hotel grounds .<ssssss>if you like the night sound of bug and bird chirp , you will love tih place .<ssssss>these room be also cheaper than the ocean view room , which , unlike the garden room , be not right on the ocean .<ssssss>the garden room be definitely a better value for the money.the room themselves be show they age .<ssssss>nice decoration and feel , but a tiny tv and a older bathroom be item you do not expect in a top resort .<ssssss>the one aspect of the hotel that be a real turn-off be the system of reserve beach and pool chair with a towel .<ssssss>its one thing if you be get up to get a drink , but another when you be go for several hour .<ssssss>i notice a lot of people would do this , particularly on the beach where the number of chair with shade be limit .<ssssss>i would hope that the hotel change this policy in the future and limit the unoccupied time to 30 minute -- its simply not fair to the other guests.i be also disappoint when i leave the hotel .<ssssss>taxi be quite abundant in sanur -- just wait for 30 seconds and one will pass buy -- and it be we intent to take one to the airport .<ssssss>the hotel first try to sell we they shuttle -lrb- at 3x the price of a metered taxi -rrb- , and then offer to call a taxi in use they service for 2x the price of the normal metered rate .<ssssss>it be only when we start to walk to the street that the offer to flag down a taxi .<ssssss>it be a shameless way to try and make a few extra dollars.last gripe : what be up with not have a alarm clock in the room ?<ssssss>
1 3 3 4 2 3 1 2		do not do it !!<ssssss>my boyfriend and i be very dissatisfied with the new barcelo raval hotel in barcelona when we go on they opening weekend.we understand that the hotel be in its opening day and the staff be still be train and get use to the system in place , however this do not excuse the attitude of some of the staff , in particular the concierge/security and the service that we received.we arrive in the early hour of friday morning , check in and go to we room .<ssssss>i have a shower and it flood the bedroom !<ssssss>i phone down to reception and they say we have two option ; we could stay in the room -lrb- why we would want to stay in a flood room be beyond I ! -rrb-<ssssss>or move .<ssssss>i request that we move and we be show to a new room along the corridor .<ssssss>this be a huge inconvenience as we have unpacked we belongings .<ssssss>the man that show we to we new room also say that this have happen in various other room so i find it unbelievable that this be not check in we room before we be check into it.on friday we arrive back at the hotel at approx 5pm and we room have still not be clean .<ssssss>the cleaner finally come round at about 5.30 pm but we be in we room relaxing and do not want to have to leave .<ssssss>this should have be clean in the morning and not in the evening .<ssssss>we want to hire bike for the day on saturday so on friday pm i call down to reception and ask for recommendation for bike hire .<ssssss>i be tell that they would look into it and get back to I .<ssssss>i never receive a call back .<ssssss>again very poor customer service for a 4 * hotel.on saturday morning we awake at approx 10am and we have no lite breakfast wait on we door .<ssssss>i call down to reception to ask where it be and they say they would send one up .<ssssss>20 min later we still have no breakfast so i call down again and once again no breakfast arrive .<ssssss>after a third call they finally manage to send up we breakfast 40 min after we have to call and ask for it , which we should not have have to do in the first place .<ssssss>i receive no apology for this delay and when it arrive it be the same breakfast as the day before .<ssssss>i would have think you would have provide a variety for the cost.on friday night there be demonstration outside the hotel which be highly threatening and we receive no explanation from the hotel staff as to what be go on .<ssssss>the hotel be be cover in graffitus , there be egg and bottle be throw at the door and window and it be a deeply unnerving experience .<ssssss>there be numerous guest in the lobby wait to go out and we just get tell to move away from the door with no explanation or apology .<ssssss>we want to leave to go for dinner and be usher out the back door as the front door have be lock and be surround by demonstrator .<ssssss>again there be no explanation or apology and this be truly despicable customer service.on numerous occasion upon enter the hotel we be also ask by the concierge/security where we be go and if we be stay there .<ssssss>it be the same man every day that ask the same question and make we feel most unwelcome .<ssssss>if i pay to stay in a 4 * establishment i do not expect to feel target by the staff and make to feel as if we should not be stay there.i would also like to comment regard the lighting in the room , there be too many gadget and light everywhere that make it very difficult to get a good night sleep , also the soundproofing in the hotel be appalling and we could here the footstep from the room upstairs , noise from next door and here the voice in the corridor at 4 in the morning word for word.the room also have no bin so we have to pile up we rubbish on the side , not only be this highly unhygienic , it be very unsightly and messy for guest .<ssssss>also we have a espresso machine and tea bag , yet we have no mug and coffee cup to go with it .<ssssss>again this be very poorly think out and bad customer service.all in all the stay at you hotel be unenjoyable and a complete farce and the fact that it be the opening weekend can not be use as a excuse .<ssssss>
1 3 1 -1 2 -1 -1 -1		oh dear small , dark , dingy bedroom .<ssssss>we get a good deal on the net but suffer greatly with the accommodation offer .<ssssss>we move room after the first night which be a improvement due to its window and you could walk round the bed !!<ssssss>spend as much time out as to avoid spending time in the room .<ssssss>hotel bar be good - as long as you be happy drinking on you own !!<ssssss>next time will consider a 3 star and pay the same rate , as i think 4 star just over-rate themselves<ssssss>
1 2 2 1 3 3 4 -1		very dangerous location a friend and i stay at this hotel for a mom 's get-away weekend in july .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very old and in need of repair .<ssssss>the bathroom have zero space for toiletries etc. also , my friend get lock in the bathroom b/c the door-handle would not release the latch .<ssssss>have she be in the room by herself , she would have spend the night in there until housekeeping come the next day .<ssssss>note : keep you cell phone in you pocket !!<ssssss>we also have to call for a repair to the reading lamp between the bed .<ssssss>someone have cut off the plug .<ssssss>i will say that we repair request be handle in a timely manner.my biggest complaint about this hotel be the location .<ssssss>yes , it be close to union square and within walking-distance , but you be take you life in you hand walk around in this area .<ssssss>very unsafe !!<ssssss>you will need to take a cab everywhere , even in the middle of the day .<ssssss>trust I !!<ssssss>the hotel be not terrible , but it be located in a very seedy part of town.the restaurant be mediocre but the service be excellent .<ssssss>the staff , overall , be very helpful , but i would never stay here again .<ssssss>location , location , location !!!!<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 1 3 3 1		dingy and disappointing the selling point for this hotel be that the location be great access many boston landmark -lrb- quincy market , waterfront , north end -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be spacious , but in need of major renovation .<ssssss>the carpet be dingy and stain and the bedding look severely out of date .<ssssss>the bathroom have a slide pocket door , which be weird .<ssssss>the furniture in general look wear and date .<ssssss>hallway be depressing and dark .<ssssss>i will not stay here again .<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 5 4 4 -1		disappointing stay - some good and some bad this be not the short drive from the airport tout by the website.the shuttle run once per hour during daylight hour only , so you may have a long wait to catch it , then a long wait in traffic before arrive .<ssssss>the hotel itself be quite nice , very clean and comfortable .<ssssss>the people at the desk be helpful and seem knowledgable .<ssssss>the problem be the only restaurant on the property , which be pretty awful , although i must say the food be very good .<ssssss>how could this be ?<ssssss>well the service be awful .<ssssss>a completely empty restaurant , we stand at the entry more than ten minute as the staff walk around inside talk to one another and ignore we .<ssssss>once seat -lrb- oh yes , we be open ... -rrb- another very long , long wait for sometone to take we order , bring water , etc. on top of that , even though it clearly state on the menu that gratuity be add on bill for five or more people , they add two gratuity to we party of two 's bill .<ssssss>i do not notice till i look at the bill later that there be three gratuity , my own and they two .<ssssss>that make my $ 16 .<ssssss>hamburger and soda more than $ 36 .<ssssss>since there be no other restaurant within sight , i foolishly eat breakfast there the next morning and get another two gratuity put on my bill .<ssssss>by the way , cereal and milk be $ 12 .<ssssss>if you want anything with egg it be at least $ 16.00 -lrb- before the add-on gratuity and sale tax . -rrb-<ssssss>the front desk be nice about take my own gratuity off the check upon check-out but say the restaurant be a separate entity and she could not change the price or gratauity they add .<ssssss>oh yeah , afterthe gratuitis be add , then they add sale tax to that .<ssssss>i check and find out that in florida you be not allow to charge tax on gratuity which be a payroll item , however they do it anyway.because of the restaurant experience , i feel very rip off so i do not have a good experience .<ssssss>if you stay there , it would be much better to take a cab or the complimentary shuttle to another restaurant .<ssssss>there be several about one mile way .<ssssss>
4 5 3 3 5 5 5 3		would stay again and again !<ssssss>this hotel be in a transitional area , the tendloin/nob hill area .<ssssss>i feel safe , the room be as picture on the website and exceptionally clean .<ssssss>the bathroom be as clean as can be !<ssssss>the hotel staff be exceptionally friendly , courteous , helpful .<ssssss>they print tourist resource directly for I from the internet .<ssssss>continental breakfast be white bread toast , coffee , store buy muffin .<ssssss>for the price in san fran , the cleanliness , and the hospitality of all staff , i would definitely stay again !<ssssss>

3 3 4 5 5 3 3 -1		great hotel if you get a good price we have stay at the queen crescent on two different occasion : once in the fall of 2006 and once in january 2007 .<ssssss>on both occasion we choose the hotel base on its location and cheap price -lrb- approx $ 80/night -rrb- .<ssssss>during we first stay we stay in the main building in a very small room that be clean and very pretty .<ssssss>we have no complaint that trip -lrb- however , i be a little annoyed just like other traveler about the resort fee internet book fee ... but i have quickly learn the resort fee be become very popular in other nola hotel too ... -rrb- .<ssssss>during we second trip we stay in the secondary building and be not nearly as happy .<ssssss>the room be even smaller than the first time we stay i do not feel very safe in the secondary building .<ssssss>also , they valet company have quit so we have to park we car ourselves -lrb- they tell we to park it in the garage across the street but we find a street spot for free ... -rrb- .<ssssss>i would stay a the qc again as long as it continue to have cheap rate but i would request a room in the main building and be aware of any additional fee .<ssssss>
4 -1 5 4 5 3 4 2		top value and location nice modern hotel , great stroll to the beach too .<ssssss>lot of good place to eat and drink nearby , a bit suburban for young singles maybe but very comfortable and convenient for those with young children.big supermarket and shopping mall down the main avenue , and the tram and bus be right in front of the hotel , so very convenient for get into the city .<ssssss>
1 1 3 -1 2 -1 1 -1		avoid at all cost this be simply a abomination of a hotel .<ssssss>from the first impression of not be greet , dirty entrance , rude doorman , terrible front desk staff .<ssssss>avoid the taxi que at the fron of this hotel - or risk be rip off .<ssssss>many visitor be complain during we stay .<ssssss>also , if you enjoy the fact the the lobby seating be take by smoking taxi driver on break and other assorted riff-raff - this be you place .<ssssss>marriott should be ashamed !!!!!!<ssssss>friviolous charge on check out - and surly and confrontational service during stay .<ssssss>i have never encounter any marriott brand in which customer be so worried -lrb- not just we but many other too -rrb- .<ssssss>unsafe - particularly at night - unsupervised entry - inattentive staff - non-existent doorman and bellcap .<ssssss>a very ugly experience .<ssssss>avoid this trap and stay at other hotel -lrb- both the marriott west and renaissance be exceptionel -rrb- .<ssssss>
1 4 5 2 5 2 2 3		beautiful but security be lack beautiful new resort with excellent staff .<ssssss>location amongst the rice field make it romantic , but it have have problem report in the local news relate to security .<ssssss>for some reason , security issue be not allow to be report on trip dvisor 's website ; however , i advise that you heed this warning .<ssssss>when we stay at the resort , there be a terrible stab and robbery in the middle of the night which we be witness to .<ssssss>the hotel staff and security be useless , try to hide the incident and do not catch the invader .<ssssss>people should be warn about these type of incident before they choose a place .<ssssss>too bad trip advisor do not allow for these warning to be place on they website to assist traveler .<ssssss>
3 3 5 3 5 3 1 -1		service not impress it be a gorgeous hotel overall .<ssssss>the hotel be modern , the view be amazing and the room , especially the bathroom , be out-of-this-world .<ssssss>however , beware of the hotel service , which be definitely sub-standard for its class and price range .<ssssss>the hotel be unbelievably stingy !<ssssss>the housekeeping would not refresh the toiletries or towel every day .<ssssss>in fact , they take away towel and toiletries , like second roll of toilet papers , we request the night before .<ssssss>we have to keep ask for additional toiletry day after day.there be also no complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning and you be expect to pay 4 euro for a expresso pouch and some more $ for water to make you own coffee in you room .<ssssss>the hotel staff also do not seem to be familiar with the affiliated third-party tourist service the hotel provide .<ssssss>the concierge send we on a few wild goose chase because they do not know where the tour bus stop and restaurant they recommend be and they hour of operation .<ssssss>it be extremely frustrating when you pay so much and expect to depend on they local knowledge to explore and enjoy you stay in a foreign city .<ssssss>

2 2 3 5 4 5 2 5		pretty good if you be a heavy sleeper as my favorite hotel be fully book , i try the relais bosquet as it be located to where i need to be albeit a bit more expensive .<ssssss>the room be small but adequate .<ssssss>skip the 15 euro breakfast and walk out of the hotel , turn left , walk 15 step and you be at a wonderful bakery !<ssssss>walk to rue cler for coffee at any number of cafe 's .<ssssss>the room be very clean , and the bathroom be update .<ssssss>the free wi-fi work great .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i never turn on the tv .<ssssss>the shutter do a great job of keep out the light .<ssssss>my work in paris keep I out until usually midnight , so i want to sleep in until at least 9 a.m. this be where the hotel lose point .<ssssss>the door be very heavy and start slam at around 7:00 a.m. they be very loud and wake I up each morning.my other complaint be that the night desk people be uninpsired to help customer .<ssssss>they be there because they have to be .<ssssss>not even a good evening when i come in at night .<ssssss>on the other hand , christian and frederica be very helpful.i would suggest another hotel if you want to sleep past 7:00 .<ssssss>if you want to get up early , and hit the site , the hotel be adequate .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 3 5		a nice place well let I start by say i have travel to quite a few place and just be forewarn that some of the thing people write on these review be way off base .<ssssss>ocean blue be definitely a beautiful hotel with excellent grounds and beach area .<ssssss>the resort be keep very clean and in comparison to other resort in punta cana the walking be not that much .<ssssss>most of the other review tell you the same thing that i could tell you .<ssssss>light bulb a must !<ssssss>lighting be very dim .<ssssss>if you want to know where they should place you ... ask for the elite villa 6 or 10 .<ssssss>otherwise villa 9 be the next best place .<ssssss>my kid have a excellent time and be entertain the entire time .<ssssss>age 14 and 11 .<ssssss>if you be look for a good animation staff they be very nice and friendly , especially domingo and pablo .<ssssss>but they do not have a lot of music happen regularly because older people have complain that the pool area be too noisy .<ssssss>not so ... the blue pool be definitely very quiet if that be what you be look for .<ssssss>the show be not that great other than miss ocean it be very funny but not for small child .<ssssss>the other show be mostly just different dancer dancing .<ssssss>the beach area be fantastic .<ssssss>as for food the best restaurant be the italian and mexican , the italian antipasto bar be fantastic .<ssssss>the main entree be not that great but if you like italian cheese , olive and tomato , prociutto and boccanginus you must visit this restaurant .<ssssss>route 66 be horrible .<ssssss>the mexican be great again for the buffet bar to start .<ssssss>otherwise you can not go wrong in the buffet restaurant .<ssssss>the best be breakfast where you can make you own omlette and pasta at lunch time .<ssssss>as for people who say they could not eat at this place i be sorry you be totally wrong .<ssssss>even my picky child eat enough to keep they full .<ssssss>remember this be not you regular home cooking you have to adjust you mind to where you be .<ssssss>mike 's coffee excellent !<ssssss>ask for the cheesecake and they latte be amazing .<ssssss>lobby area at night be fantastic for live entertainment , the music be very uplifting to watch .<ssssss>if you be look for friendly reception staff do not expect it much these people work very slow and basically do not care if you be wait or need something from they .<ssssss>one time the manager be in the bathroom and when you go back they say he be not work today .<ssssss>so the answer do not jive !<ssssss>but other than that the resort be truly lovely and clean .<ssssss>and the water be drinkable .<ssssss>do not waste you time wait to early when it be time to leave because they usually make you waste more time than you have too .<ssssss>enjoy you last few minute as much as you can .<ssssss>
3 2 2 4 2 4 -1 -1		it be ok we get a very good deal on this hotel , with air from sfo , through pleasant holiday .<ssssss>when we arrive we find the room to be pretty basic , but fairly clean .<ssssss>my wife do the routine bed bug search and , find none , we settle in -lrb- i have never really have much confidence in we bug detection ability , but it make we feel better -rrb- .<ssssss>the first morning , i awake early and see a cockroach scurry under the dresser , but that be the only bad bug experience and i suspect roach be find in a lot of honolulu hotel .<ssssss>still , cleanliness take a hit because of this .<ssssss>the location be excellent , only a couple of block from the beach through a nice park .<ssssss>security be not a problem .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and the pool and hot tub be all right .<ssssss>there be a bar next to the pool which be kind of a dive , but with good happy hour price and a nice restaurant attach to the lobby.if the price be real good , we would probably go back .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 4 4 -1 3		not as good as advertise the hotel be not as nice as the website suggest .<ssssss>the room be small and clean with a tv , but be decorate in a very basic fashion .<ssssss>the style be suppose to be minimalist but this seem to be a excuse for cheap furniture and white wall without any character .<ssssss>the bathroom be pleasant enough but the toilet seat be break and the shower do not drain very quickly.the buffet breakfast be pleasant without be anything special.the staff be friendly enough , and helpful when we ask they questions.overall the room be clean and in a good location but not as nice as the website suggest .<ssssss>it be not the elegant chic place as advertised and be overprice .<ssssss>
5 5 5 4 5 5 5 2		wonderful hotel we have a excellent stay .<ssssss>we room be clean and modern and we have a excellent view of the city from the 26th floor .<ssssss>the staff be attentive , friendly and go out of they way to make we feel welcome .<ssssss>the location be a bit a rough but undesirable can easily be avoid by walk down safer street .<ssssss>the hotel staff happily map out a safe walking route to nearby attraction .<ssssss>we find the valet parking extremely expensive and unnecessary .<ssssss>cheap parking be available in lot across the street for a quarter of the cost .<ssssss>several restaurant be also within walk distance so donât feel pressured to spring for breakfast at the hotel .<ssssss>one cost we couldnât avoid be the internet .<ssssss>it would have be nice if this charge be include .<ssssss>bottom line : a wonderful hotel with excellent staff and great room .<ssssss>just watch the extra charge , they add up quickly if youâre not careful .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 4 2 1 1		do not bother .<ssssss>i book this hotel for a trip to sydney for my 1st wedding anniversary after read good review on this site .<ssssss>.<ssssss>and i wish i have not bothered.the only good thing about this hotel be the location , right next to pitt st mall -lrb- fantastic shopping ! -rrb-<ssssss>, near town hall station and a 10 minute walk to the rock and circular quay , which be one of the most beautiful part of any city i have seen.the worst thing about this hotel be the service .<ssssss>it be absolutely shocking , across all area - and i be far from fussy when it come to service , promptness and a smile be all it take to make I happy .<ssssss>the first offender be concierge .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we arrive quite late -lrb- 11pm -rrb- , lug we bag inside , be not greet at all and , without look up , the guy grunt ` check-in be on level 8 ' .<ssssss>no offer to take we bag , no greet , nothing .<ssssss>no matter who be there , they remain equally as rude and disinterested we entire stay.check in be just as bad , i have never wait so long , no apology for the wait , no smile or welcome .<ssssss>i have upgrade we room to one on the executive club floor and there be a confusion with this , which annoy I because i would expressly tell the reservation girl that i want it to be a surprise for my husband .<ssssss>we , again , lug we bag to we room ourselves and be give no instruction as to breakfast , pool and gym level and close time , facility , nothing .<ssssss>the room be nice enough , but nothing -lrb- and i mean nothing -rrb- like the hotel 's website , especially not the executive club room .<ssssss>we room be not even as nice as the standard picture show on the website , and i wish i have not bother waste my money on the upgrade .<ssssss>it be not spacious at all , in fact a little on the small side compare to other hotel i have stay in , and we have no view of the harbour at all , as promise by the website .<ssssss>the bathroom be nicely appoint with a seperate bath and shower but we have to ring housekeeping to get 2 towel -lrb- when the booking be for 2 people ?? -rrb-<ssssss>the turndown service at night be a good touch , with chocolate on the pillow , and the cleanliness be of a ok standard -lrb- if a little dusty -rrb- .<ssssss>that bring I to the executive club .<ssssss>what a absolute joke .<ssssss>seriously , help-yourself lukewarm party pie and curry puff do not constitute ` canape ' .<ssssss>and the measly selection of ` hot ' food be always luke warm , even though we get there at 5.45 pm .<ssssss>it take such a long time for they to replenish anything , and as for the cheese board -lrb- no cold meat , just a few cheese and water cracker -rrb- , once a type of cheese be go , that be it for the rest of the night .<ssssss>you have to serve you own drink , which my husband enjoy because he be free to have triple shot of bourbon , but part of what i pay for be ` service ' , which be not provide at all.the breakfast up there be even worse .<ssssss>baked bean , ham and cheese croissant , spinach puff , scramble egg be among the food that always run out , take at least half a hour to replace -lrb- if they be replace at all -rrb- .<ssssss>on we third day there they run out of cutlery and juice glass !<ssssss>when i ask the ` attendant ' -lrb- say very sarcastically - he be completely hopeless -rrb- if he know there be no juice glass he reply yes - i know .<ssssss>no apology , explanation , nothing !<ssssss>i have actually work business club service in a 4-star hotel and if we run out of anything it be the absolute sin of all sin , but at the swissotel noone cared.breakfast downstairs be almost as bad .<ssssss>not to mention the fact that they try to make we pay , even though i would pay for it in my original booking , the amount for breakfast be not refund when i upgrade , and the reservation girl who i arrange the upgrade with expressly tell I i could eat at both .<ssssss>none of that seem to matter with staff , who argue with I for at least 10 minute until we finally agree to just eat upstairs for the rest of we stay .<ssssss>they have the same issue with replace food , i have never see anything like it .<ssssss>honestly , i be actually quite easy to please , but i be so disappointed with this hotel especially as it be suppose to be such a special time for I and my husband .<ssssss>business traveller and those just pass through would probably be ok with it but i do not recommend it at all for people want a romantic getaway .<ssssss>sydney itself be a lot of fun , so much to do , great food and you can not go past the opera house for impressive , but choose somewhere else to stay .<ssssss>

4 3 5 5 5 3 5 4		great harbor area hotel my wife and i have now stay at this intercontinental several time .<ssssss>we really like the classy room decor , the location near long wharf and quincy market , and the great bars/restaurants right on the premises.the spa/work out area be amazing , and we make a point of work out at least twice during each stay .<ssssss>the view be neat , and the equipment be top notch .<ssssss>the steam room be a add bonus.we have have drinks/food at rhumba , sushi-teq , and miel , as well as room service .<ssssss>on all occasion the food be great and the drink be amazing .<ssssss>a add bonus be the champagne party they throw in the lobby on the first saturday night of every month.the room be comfy , and well design .<ssssss>the bathroom be truly spacious and well make .<ssssss>the only problem we could fathom be the divider between the bathroom and bedroom .<ssssss>shy type may have a issue with this.i agree with the other review that the valet car pick-up be poorly design , and that go down to the parking lot should not be a part of the experience .<ssssss>the car should be bring to the front of the hotel like everywhere else .<ssssss>aside from that , and occasionally surly staff , this hotel be great !<ssssss>we will definitely keep stay here , at least until the mandarin oriental open in july .<ssssss>
2 4 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		warn for priceline bidder !<ssssss>i win a priceline bid for two room at the hotel rex , bidding several month before we stay .<ssssss>i immediately call the hotel with my confirmation number , and they confirm that we be book for two room , each with one queen bed .<ssssss>upon arrival at the room , the other couple in we party have no trouble check in - get a nice roome on the 7th floor with a queen bed .<ssssss>but when we try to check in to the other room , they could find no record of we reservation - which , of course , should have be impossible give that i bid for both room at one time .<ssssss>when i try to explain as much , the desk clerk actually tell I to calm down .<ssssss>i have to figure that he be not long for this line of work when he first reaction to a screw-up by the hotel be to tell the customer to calm down .<ssssss>once they manage to determine that we actually do have a reservation , they stick we in tiny room on the second floor with one double bed .<ssssss>it be conveniently located just two step from both the stair and the elevator , so we could hear everyone come and go .<ssssss>the single-pane glass in the window also allow we to hear everything that be go on in the street below , and the second floor location put be right at eye level with the street light , so that it be nice and bright in we room all night long.morals of the story - hope that you do not win this hotel through priceline - call ahead to confirm you reservation do not actually mean that you reservation will exist when you get there .<ssssss>- if they do lose you reservation , you be not allow to have any reaction to the situation .<ssssss>- do not book this hotel at all for more than one person if you be not fine with the idea of end up with a double bed .<ssssss>- if you do end up in this hotel anyway , try to pursuede the desk clerk to put you on a high floor , as i be sure this would help immensly with the noise and light from the street .<ssssss>

4 4 3 -1 3 -1 5 -1		very nice visit !<ssssss>my husband and i be at the grand from 7/16 -7 / 23 .<ssssss>we be in 3130 , perfect location , first floor with balcony face pool and on corner of beach .<ssssss>i , like many of the previous reviewer , be very worried about my trip after read the several negative review , even consider canceling .<ssssss>however , we do not encounter any of these problem .<ssssss>this be a very nice resort .<ssssss>the grounds be very nice and very well keep .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful .<ssssss>though we speak no spanish , there really be no communication problem .<ssssss>the food be great at all the restaurant .<ssssss>the person that complain of the buffet not be like it be in the city should probably stay in the city .<ssssss>this be the dr , not the united state !<ssssss>there be drink and food/snacks available almost anywhere on the resort at anytime of the day -lrb- fruit stand on the beach , etc. -rrb- .<ssssss>they work regularly to clean this up .<ssssss>there be plenty of entertainment , and plenty for the child -lrb- though we do not have child -rrb- .<ssssss>we go on the outback safari which i really like .<ssssss>this be a great way to see how the people in the dr really live and a fun time .<ssssss>the driver and guide be attentive , knowledgeable , and a lot of fun .<ssssss>basically , there be as much to do or as little to do as you want each day .<ssssss>we do not do much in the evening as we be tire from be in the sun all day , but there be plenty offer .<ssssss>there be a big movie screen and they show a movie nightly before the entertainment .<ssssss>this be a good way to relax .<ssssss>there be a magician show one night that be very good .<ssssss>though this be all inclusive we tip and i would suggest so .<ssssss>if you can afford to go on this trip , you can afford to tip .<ssssss>the staff work many hour -lrb- most from morning 'til late night -rrb- and some for two or four week straight until get a day off , and they work very hard .<ssssss>they really appreciate the extra .<ssssss>probably the only slightly negative thing i can say be the room do need update .<ssssss>we sink be clog so the water take a long time to drain .<ssssss>the water pressure in the shower be bad and on two occasion there be no hot water .<ssssss>both time we call the desk and that be fix immediately .<ssssss>we do not spend much time in the room so none of this be really a issue .<ssssss>because someone have complain about the room be musty , i take a gel odor absorber and this work wonder .<ssssss>also , there be tiny bug on the counter -lrb- i do not think this can be prevent because of the location -rrb- .<ssssss>i spray off on they the first night and hardly see again .<ssssss>we see no rat , roach or any other creature .<ssssss>bottom line ... the people that complain would probably complain no matter where they be .<ssssss>if you want to go somewhere that be like the we -lrb- or you home country -rrb- , then stay there .<ssssss>do not go to another country and expect thing to be the same and certainly do not complain about thing that nobody have control over -lrb- seaweed on the beach , which they work to clean up ; warm water in the pool , etc. -rrb- .<ssssss>we have not be to any other resort so have nothing to compare to , however , we would certainly recommend this resort .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 4 -1 -1		cheap place to sleep but nothing more we stay at pension dalus for 3 night durig we spain trip .<ssssss>the good thing about this place be :1 .<ssssss>great location2 .<ssssss>nice stuff3 .<ssssss>low pricethe less nice point be :1 .<ssssss>the room and the bathroom be very small .2 .<ssssss>the room and the bath be not very spruce but generally clean .3 .<ssssss>the street be pretty noisy at night .<ssssss>we be ok with it , but generally it be a disadvantage .4 .<ssssss>there be long and very steep stair and no elevator .<ssssss>take it into concideration when you be pack you luggage.generally i can reccomend this hostel for young and singles who be not aware of luxury and comfortableness .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 2 2 -1		a huge disappointment when we arrive at the hotel we be assign 2 room on the first floor .<ssssss>upon enter the room one have the a/c fan run full speed .<ssssss>the other room the a/c be not work .<ssssss>the room both have a very foul odor of mold and mildew .<ssssss>we ask to be move .<ssssss>the staff be not happy about do so but comply and we be give room on the 3rd floor .<ssssss>no odor , but in need of a good scrubbing .<ssssss>we small child be excite to have a pool .<ssssss>it be also run down and in need of cleaning .<ssssss>no bar be ever open at the motel .<ssssss>if you want a drink you have to get it from the life guard at the pool !<ssssss>the grounds around the pool be run down and not care for .<ssssss>the roof top bar be a joke .<ssssss>-lrb- when it be open -rrb- this place have a lot of potential .<ssssss>it need a lot of work to be consider a 4 star .<ssssss>the cold breakfast be the worst we have ever have and we have stay in 7 , 4-5 star hotel through out italy .<ssssss>this place need to be reavaluated.the decor be severly out date .<ssssss>the location be the only thing it have go for it .<ssssss>
3 2 3 -1 4 -1 4 -1		yes , but ... just return to the usa after a week at the tourville .<ssssss>on the plus side , the room be clean , the bed very comfortable , the tub be deep with plenty of hot water , the hotel be cozy , the staff be friendly , and the location be excellent.however , i pay for and confirm a room with a view of the avenue , but no one mention that the view be block by scaffolding and net , since the facade be be renovate -lrb- but , after all , it be a competitive business -rrb- .<ssssss>if you need to iron , they will set the iron and board up in the breakfast room for you to use .<ssssss>you will find this a bit inconvenient , and if you attempt to iron everything for the come week , it be go to get a little warm in that space .<ssssss>the room be small , and there be only a single chifforobe to hang and fold clothes .<ssssss>there be no coffee pot and the continental breakfast provide be currently 12 euro per person.in short , i very much like the staff and the location , but this be a three-star accomodation , at best .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 3 3 3		well located , but disappoint by the lack of amenity , the noise and price stay here with the wife and kid over thanksgiving week .<ssssss>owner be nice folk who be full of local info and spend a good amount of time give I a run down on the transport and sightseeing option .<ssssss>i have try really hard to like this place but can not help feeling disappoint with the stay .<ssssss>the family suite be huge but there be no family-specific amenity supply like cutlery or crockery .<ssssss>there be a microwave oven supply but again no bowl , etc to use inside it .<ssssss>the free continental breakfast comprise a tray of pastry and a fruit bowl in reception .<ssssss>this be appreciate but stretch the definition of a continental breakfast.my biggest complaint be the noise from other room .<ssssss>the building be of timber construction and date back to 1955 .<ssssss>we be on the 2nd floor -lrb- one above ground level -rrb- and the noise level transmit down from the wooden floor of the 3rd level above be very high .<ssssss>we be wake at 5am most morning by the noise from early-rising guest located above .<ssssss>we could hear every voice , footstep , run water , toilet flush , etc.the lack of in-room amenity and the noise level make the family suite overprice in my opinion at $ 184.00 per night plus taxes.on a positive note , the place be very clean and be well position with a one block walk to the nearest powell-hyde cable car stop .<ssssss>
3 2 2 4 4 4 4 3		long wait for elevator every time i go out and back to the hotel , or when pop up to the gym , i have to endure long wait time for the elevator .<ssssss>there be so many elevator but they always seem to be elsewhere .<ssssss>i stay there for business and when i return in the evening after meeting , that seem to be peak hour and there be a constant sizeable crowd wait in the foyer .<ssssss>
4 5 2 -1 4 -1 5 -1		excellent location as have already be say , the hotel be in a excellent location but the room definitely be too small .<ssssss>i travel with my mother and we have two single bed in the room , squashed together with only just enough room to get out/in bed .<ssssss>cupboard space be very minimal with two drawer only and really no space to place more than one suitcase .<ssssss>the bed though be very comfortable and above average for a hotel.we purchase a package which include the buffet breakfast and i can highly recommend this - it be excellent .<ssssss>so many choice and excellent service .<ssssss>the restaurant on the other hand be very expensive.the only complaint i have be from the tourist desk when i enquired about a visa to china and be tell a totally incorrect amount about four time the actual cost .<ssssss>this be obviously due to the lady be unable to understand english all that well.coffee and tea facility be on the very frugal side , enough for one cup a day if there be two of you in the room.also the free email service be no longer available and now cost $ 40 hk for 30 minute use and the lag be unbelieveable and not really worth use .<ssssss>
2 2 4 2 4 1 2 -1		very over-rated !!!!!<ssssss>my husband i recently stay here for we 10th wedding anniversay .<ssssss>we have a very ` rare ' 4 day away from we 2 child .<ssssss>after spend alot of time read the review of all the hotel in the darling habour area in we price range i think the novotel look really nice.i be bitterly dissapoint with pretty much everything about the hotel.firstly have be up since 3am we be hope to check-in to we room at little early .<ssssss>the reception say check-in be not until 2pm and there be no way we could check - in early .<ssssss>the make absolutely no effort to help we .<ssssss>anyway ... .<ssssss>after a exhausting day in sydney we come back to the hotel expect to go straight up to we room only to be tell that it still be not ready -lrb- 2.30 pm -rrb- .<ssssss>they say there be some sort of problem with the blind .<ssssss>by 3pm i be desperate to get some sleep and ask if there be any other room we could have .<ssssss>all they could offer we be a basic room -lrb- we have book and pay for superior king with garden view -rrb- not good enough .<ssssss>after wait another hour or so we be finally take to we room .<ssssss>i must say it be quite nice , good size comfotable bed .<ssssss>bathroom be pretty tired , but it be fine .<ssssss>i must say i be expect it to be alot nicer.we receive no appology from the staff or any kind of compensation.the facility be pretty poor too .<ssssss>the pool area be not very appealing .<ssssss>be ok at best .<ssssss>same with the gym.breakfast be ok , selection be average for the price .<ssssss>on we last day we go down for breakfast at 10am , we be tell they shut at 10.30 am .<ssssss>we assume they would have the normal selection avaliable , but alot of it be go , and not replace .<ssssss>not even any coffee !!!<ssssss>they wait staff be pack everything up at 10.20 be which we feel be very rude .<ssssss>very dissapointed.room service be fine , as be selection of movie .<ssssss>room be clean well .<ssssss>house keep be very noisy outside we room at 8am most day , so do not stay here if you want a sleep-in !<ssssss>we have another issue which we find very frustrating .<ssssss>we want to hire a car for a day and reception be really helpful .<ssssss>they give we a price list , book the car and arrange to have it deliver to hotel .<ssssss>fantastic service !!<ssssss>however ... they ask we about what time we would be return the car , and we say about 7-8pm .<ssssss>we return back about 6.15 pm , and ask they to ring the car hire place -lrb- avis -rrb- to collect the car .<ssssss>they inform we they close at 6pm , and we would have to pay $ 30 for overnight parking !!!!<ssssss>we be amaze that they have not think to mention to we when we book the car .<ssssss>very poor customer service.generally we both find the staff at reception rude and unhelpful .<ssssss>the conceirge be pretty good though.the location of this hotel be pretty good , however i think there be some that be alot better .<ssssss>it be about a 20 min walk to where the ferry leave from , and alot of the resturant and bar .<ssssss>much further than i have think it would be .<ssssss>not great if you have a really busy day and just want to get back to the hotel.i would say the location of the other novotel be much better , also four point , ibis , medina , crown plaza etc.and do not even bother ask for a late check out .<ssssss>they be go to charge we $ 20 per hour .<ssssss>they do hold we bag for we .<ssssss>but no room to change in and shower .<ssssss>i have to unpack my bag in the main lobby and change in the toilet ... nice!i will not be stay here again , !<ssssss>st due to the terrible attitude of the staff ,2 nd because of the very average facility -lrb- would rate a 3star at best ! -rrb-<ssssss>and lastly because i think there be other much better located hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 5 5 4		nice place , but noisy this be a nice hotel , if the decor be a little dated , but the dated nature of the place be the real problem .<ssssss>we room face the back and it be very noisy when we open the window to let cool air in .<ssssss>nighttime be the real problem as we could not sleep with the window open as there be some mechanical unit thump outside , and when we close the window and have the fan running , it too thump loudly .<ssssss>not only that , the design of the place have the next door bathroom right next to we head while we be sleep , and because the wall be not insulate for noise we hear the neighbour , and those above we , everytime they flush the toilet .<ssssss>the old style door also let in a inordinate amout of light and be not make for keep out noise from the hallway .<ssssss>as for size it be a nice size and the bed be reasonably comfortable and the coffee and tea service be a nice touch .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful , but ask the concierge for direction not the front desk people .<ssssss>it be a clean place , and a good place to rest , if not get a great night 's sleep .<ssssss>
1 1 3 3 3 2 1 1		would not recommend this resort to anyone ... .<ssssss>the resort , room , buffet , be just ok .<ssssss>when it come to service , they have no idea .<ssssss>we room have no telephone , the all inclusive fridge be not inclusive .<ssssss>it be basically a mini bar we have to pay for .<ssssss>the seafood elecarte come with a $ 35.00 usd per person charge for the lobster .<ssssss>no pool side waiter .<ssssss>tip the maid be norm , but try to get they to leave you with new towel , good luck .<ssssss>breakfast 7am-10am , close then open from 12:30 pm-2 :30 pm for lunch , close then open at 7pm-11pm .<ssssss>if you miss any of the above time , good luck finding something to eat , or you could purchase a small can of planter peanut from you bar fridge for $ 9.00 usd .<ssssss>visa machine rarely work .<ssssss>in all , this be the worst travel experience we have .<ssssss>numerous other feel the same .<ssssss>although it seem that everyone that be disappointed , have book through sunquest .<ssssss>maybe they be to blame for rating this 2 star resort a 4 star .<ssssss>and one more thing , if you think you will be stay close to the beach .<ssssss>most likely be not go to happen .<ssssss>you will need to walk about 1/2 a mile , or take the tram , if there be room .<ssssss>

3 3 5 5 4 2 4 3		not quite ready to call themselves a ` luxury designer boutique hotel ' i be go to be perfectly honest .<ssssss>i expect much , much more from honolulu 's first true luxury boutique hotel .<ssssss>that be not to say that the hotel will not become that in the future .<ssssss>i can see where they want to go with they vision , and i have no doubt that they will achieve it .<ssssss>but they be far from ready to call themselves that now .<ssssss>i have very high hope for the hotel renew .<ssssss>but within moment of arrive , i know right away there go to be problem .<ssssss>we first interaction with a hotel employee be a disinterested bell-hop .<ssssss>more concerned with text messaging on he cell phone , we be leave to haul we own luggage out of the towncar .<ssssss>i know go into it that the lobby be still under construction .<ssssss>i make sure to take a peak behind the plywood barrier to see how far they have come .<ssssss>i be shock .<ssssss>they be quite a way off from anything resemble a lobby of any sort .<ssssss>i be guess sometime late this summer be a good guess at completion .<ssssss>up to the second floor to check in , and i will mention even the elevator need work .<ssssss>creaky , cramped and smell of the 60 's .<ssssss>the check-in staff be nice enough .<ssssss>we deluxe ocean view room be not ready .<ssssss>we be a couple hour early , so we anticipate some delay .<ssssss>the check-in girl call housekeeping and ask to put a rush on we room and make it a priority since we have just check in .<ssssss>very good move on she part .<ssssss>so she be to call we as soon as the room be ready .<ssssss>this be about 12:30 in the afternoon .<ssssss>at about 2:30 and no phone call , we call the hotel and be tell the room would be ready in 20 minute .<ssssss>regular check-in time be 3:00 pm .<ssssss>where be the rush we be promise ?<ssssss>the room itself be nice .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>they do a wonderful job with the space they have to work with .<ssssss>a bottle of champagne send up from the ever popular leonor have put the hotel renew back on track .<ssssss>until later that evening , the brand new toilet back up and flood a bit .<ssssss>it take 45 minute and 3 phone call to the front desk to get the request plunger send to the room .<ssssss>although i be tell the general manager would be up to take care of it himself , i be not altogether certain it be he .<ssssss>the bed be perfect , the pillow perfect , the rest be perfect .<ssssss>but i be conflict as to how i feel about the hotel on the whole .<ssssss>you can not slap on a few coat of paint , buy some nice bed linen , set up a flat screen tv and call yourself a luxury hotel .<ssssss>yes , we pay a fantastically cheap rate for a top notch location , so be this a case of you get what you pay for ?<ssssss>the hotel renew will one day be all they claim to be .<ssssss>they just quite simply , be not that right now .<ssssss>i will certainly be back and be happy to stay with they again .<ssssss>but i be go to wait a good year or so to make sure they be up and run at full speed .<ssssss>i can only in good conscience give they a neutral rating .<ssssss>they will be great one day , i be certain .<ssssss>but know go into it right now , they be not yet what they claim to be .<ssssss>

for romance .<ssssss>you would choose from a a la carte menu and all of the food be excellent at these restaurant and make to order .<ssssss>we eat at the caribe grill and mama juana 's .<ssssss>the vino be drinkable but not what i be use to ... but it be nice to drink as much as we want at no extra cost .<ssssss>we would always slip we waiter a $ 5 -lrb- or more if he be extra attentive . -rrb-<ssssss>for breakfast and lunch the buffet 's be fine and we could always find something we like .<ssssss>we think the coffee be awesome .<ssssss>i read a review where they say it be instant .<ssssss>if it be i be highly surprised and want some in my kitchen cabinet .<ssssss>love the coffee !<ssssss>beach and pool -- i do not do pool when i have a beach nearby -lrb- i dont ' have a beach in tennessee but we do have swimming pool -rrb- but from what i see they be completely full anyway .<ssssss>the beach be amazing .<ssssss>always very clean and peaceful .<ssssss>the palm tree remind you that you be in punta cana and that you be in paradise .<ssssss>the water be gorgeous and nice to swim in .<ssssss>one thing to watch out for be the gardener that be pass through and pick up the coconut that fall from the tree .<ssssss>we make the mistake of make eye contact with one of they and he ask we -lrb- in so many spanish word that we could recognize and motion with he hand -rrb- if we want he to cut it open so we could eat it .<ssssss>we say yes and he do with this huge machete .<ssssss>after he give it to we he hold he hand open for a tip .<ssssss>we have no money with we and my dear husband have to run to the room while i be leave there to try to talk to a man who speak only spanish and be hold a very sharp machete .<ssssss>we will never do that again !!<ssssss>later in the week i see another gullible tourist that fall for the same thing .<ssssss>i feel like a big dummy .<ssssss>general experience -- i do not realize i would be so out of place there .<ssssss>there be very few american and i too feel that they treat we badly just because of where we be from .<ssssss>the front desk personnel never have time to answer we question and when they do they try to act like they do not understand what we be say or they rush we along .<ssssss>i be always a patient and courteous person and i be appal by how i be treat here .<ssssss>i could always sense irritation by the bartender or wait staff because i be american .<ssssss>yet the european be treat far better than we be .<ssssss>i be honestly dumfound that i be treat this way here and it leave a very bad taste in my mouth for the region and the hotel .<ssssss>also there be two seperate occasion where the power go out at the resort .<ssssss>it be out for hour .<ssssss>we be also tell by the front desk it be not safe to leave the resort and not to be on the beach at night .<ssssss>i would have love to experience some of the culture without be require to pay $ 100 or more for a day trip .<ssssss>so we do not venture outside of the resort area 's ... we walk to the other riu resort of course ... without these place we would have go stir crazy .<ssssss>in closing ... this be a very disappointing honeymoon and i will not be back .<ssssss>recently a good friend of mine say she be think about go to punta cana .<ssssss>she have she mind set on it until i tell she of my experience .<ssssss>she decide to go to cancun mexico instead .<ssssss>so in the future i will spend my thousand of dollar in mexico where they be appreciative of tourist from the usa .<ssssss>april from tennessee , unite state of

3 1 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		nothing spectacular i have to say , i be not terribly impressed with the hotel vitale by any means .<ssssss>we have definitely experienced worse , but by no means do i think this place be anything spectacular - or worthy of four star .<ssssss>if you be just look for a reasonably clean hotel , and be not look for 4 season level service - this place should fit the bill .<ssssss>if you want some more dirt , read on ... decor alone - high mark for sure .<ssssss>great linen , and overall comfy , understate elegance .<ssssss>nice touch be the lavendar sprig they put on each door for bedtime.location - across from the embarcadero and all be great , but overall it be a pretty desolate area on the weekend with no where in walk distance to grab a coffee , etc. overall , from a service standpoint , i think it be marginal at best and bind to slide more if this be just the honeymoon phase ... we book for friday and saturday night -lrb- 4/8 and 4/9 -rrb- .<ssssss>my husband have call ahead the day before we have arrive and request a cot for we 11 year old daughter .<ssssss>the person he speak with indicate it would not be a problem and tell he to mention it upon check-in .<ssssss>we check in around 8:30 pm on friday and mention the cot to the reception desk .<ssssss>they have indicate it would not be a problem and would be arrange by the time we return from dinner .<ssssss>we get back to the hotel at 11:30 - exhaust and ready to hit the hay , suprise - no cot !<ssssss>because we be so exhaust and because we be really not complainer , we decide to squeeze into the king bed - which i have to say , be quite comfy with great linen , duvet , etc. we opt not to park we rental car at the hotel - just under $ 50 a day or so -lrb- there be a parking garage about a block away for 1/2 that -rrb- - and instead take cab .<ssssss>never once be there someone ready and wait to hail a cab as you would come to expect from 4 star hotel .<ssssss>day 2 - we return to we hotel -lrb- have spend the entire day sightseeing , shopping , etc -rrb- at 10:30 pm only to have we key not work .<ssssss>have read the other review where somone 's room be give to someone else , i have to say , we be a little concerned .<ssssss>we go back down to reception , get we new key -lrb- no sincere apology or explanation -rrb- and get back into we room - luckily , all we stuff be there!day 3 - we wait in line to check out -lrb- because they have incorrectly bill we for valet parking which we would pass on -rrb- for about 15 minute .<ssssss>the best part be the people at the desk be answer phone and accept reservation while they be try to check people out .<ssssss>on a sunday morning , i can not for the life of my understand how they would be busy themselves with reservation while there be people try to check out !<ssssss>
5 3 5 4 5 3 5 5		very nice place .<ssssss>out side<ssssss>
4 5 4 3 5 5 5 3		a very comfortable place to stay as a family of four this be a great choice to start we vacation .<ssssss>located outside the city center it provide we a place to get away from the hustle .<ssssss>the bus stop be around the corner and it be only a 10 minute ride to the main part of the city .<ssssss>so convienent !<ssssss>the breakfast be great - sabina truly do make the best cup of cappucino in town - we continually compare she cappucino to all the other we have , and none other cam close .<ssssss>the room be clean .<ssssss>the neighborhood be a fun place to explore .<ssssss>the only down side be that the choice of resturant in the neighborhood be limit , though the piccadily pizzeria be we favorite .<ssssss>my advise would be to eat before you get back or get off the bus at via dei mille and find a restaurant around there and hop back on the bus .<ssssss>

2 3 2 1 5 3 3 3		noisy , average hotel i think i do my homework in plan we sf 4 night stay , but i choose the wrong hotel in the wrong area.of course , it be not the hotel 's fault that i have not expect the area to be so noisy/touristy , but it have only single-paned windows!when checking in , i politely request a quiet room .<ssssss>we be give a room at the far end of a hallway , usually a good choice , except this one -lrb- 706 -rrb- , have a direct view of the cable car track on powell .<ssssss>we first night be so sleepless from the general street noise/sirens and the cable car , i be ready to change hotel !<ssssss>instead , we ask to be move to a quieter room on the opposite side of the hotel , which do help .<ssssss>but i find the noise level from the street and the hallways/other room to be too much , even for a older property.both room be quaint , older hotel style , the size we expect and nicely decorate .<ssssss>the bathroom be very clean .<ssssss>the shower do seem to come and go , but that be to be expect from a older property.there be many good restaurant within walk distance.we find the bed quite comfortable .<ssssss>we also like that the blanket be enfold with a second sheet , so you never touch it and get that nasty , other-people-have-slept-here-and-touched-this feel.the staff be not exceptionally friendly , but courteous .<ssssss>they do pour the wine freely and friendly at the nightly reception!the breakfast be as expect -- ordinary continental fare with bagel , fruit , and yogurt .<ssssss>oh , and make-it-yourself waffles.all in all , if i stay again in the union square area , i would choose a chain hotel which have good soundproofing .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 3 5 4 -1		very friendly staff good location , very helpful with parking the car nearby and the manager / owner be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>we stay on the older floor , so the furnishings be not so good , but it be cheaper than most other nearby hotel and over all be perfectly good for a short stay .<ssssss>
1 1 5 5 5 1 1 1		poor service , not 5 star i have one night stay in classic standard room , the enviornment and facility -lrb- exempt internet -rrb- be good enough , but the service of staff be terrible .<ssssss>i face the problem to use the hotel broadband service in the room , the room interactive system do not work at all , also my laptop could not find out the wireless login page that the hotel should offer .<ssssss>so i ask the front office to help I , but even 2 staff come to my room respectively , they be totally not familiar with the system so could not fix the problem .<ssssss>i ask they to change to another room , but the staff say it be fully book , even i think it be a lie obviously .<ssssss>they also promise to send a technical support guy in the morning to fix , but there be nothing happen , no staff come even not call for excuse.anyway i give up about the internet for that night , but surprisingly when i check out , the hotel try to charge the fee of the internet !!<ssssss>of course i reject it.and finally when i finish the check-out to head to the taxi which park in the outside , there be no any staff to help I to carry the bag !<ssssss>do you think that be the service quality of 5 star?that be my worst experience in stay in a 5 star hotel , i will not go there anymore !<ssssss>
4 2 4 4 4 2 3 2		convenient , but maybe over price the location for this hotel be great , right by the cruise terminal .<ssssss>literally a 3-5 minute shuttle ride if that .<ssssss>you could walk it if you have to .<ssssss>there be some restaurant and bar in the area , but nothing too exciting .<ssssss>it be the la harbor after all , which be fairly industrial.we book a executive suite with king bed .<ssssss>it have a separate living area with pull out sofa .<ssssss>the total be $ 243 usd after all the tax .<ssssss>i think just a normal room would have run we about $ 190 usd , and the extra space as good since other friend of ours be stay in the hotel and could come and visit as we wait in the morning to head over to we ship.the bed be comfortable , as all crowne plaza bed seem to be.but to be honest , i think it be a bit overpriced .<ssssss>i probably would not stay here again unless i can get a room for $ 100-125 usd .<ssssss>
2 3 3 4 4 5 5 3		hotel be just ok , but staff very helpful this be a clean , basic hotel but i do have to give kudos to the staff .<ssssss>they be very helpful and friendly .<ssssss>i see many other reviewer give the hotel five star and although i do not have any complaint about the room , i would rate the facility as so-so .<ssssss>we really appreciate the patience and helpfulness of the staff though .<ssssss>they be nice enough to give we detailed direction on how to get to the site nearby .<ssssss>also the staff be helpful in give we direction on get to pisa without use the toll road the next morning .<ssssss>we continually agonize in italy over whether to take the toll road - which be generally good road but frequently we be stick in lengthy traffic jam try to pay we toll to get off - or whether to take the free road .<ssssss>we be afraid the free road may be in bad shape and require very slow go .<ssssss>so we appreciate the front desk clerk 's advice to take the free fipilus road .<ssssss>as for the room , i would rate it as slightly above average for the rate .<ssssss>not memorable but nothing wrong with it .<ssssss>the breakfast attendant be pleasant and polite and the breakfast itself be ok but again nothing special .<ssssss>

3 5 5 5 4 1 2 -1		satisfaction depend on the price you pay ... .<ssssss>we stay at this hotel 1/25/08 to 1/30/08 .<ssssss>we have a great time and be very satisfied .<ssssss>this be largely because we pay a low pre-opening price and expect there would be some frustration .<ssssss>in return , we get a extremely nice room -lrb- we book the junior deluxe -rrb- at a very nice resort , on a beautiful beach .<ssssss>have say that , if you be consider book this hotel in the next 6 month , and pay something comparable to other 5 star resort , i would definitely choose something else as you will likely face a good amount of frustration .<ssssss>here be some specific thought : - the a la carte restaurant have the best food -lrb- the beef dish be particularly good -rrb- but you have to make a reservation .<ssssss>reservation be make just outside the buffet entrance during set time in the day .<ssssss>be prepare to wait in line to make a reservation .<ssssss>the asian restaurant be most popular and you can reserve to either sit at the hibatchi or at a table and order off a menu .<ssssss>hibatchi reservation be go very early in the morning .<ssssss>the food at the hibatchi be excellent.-the seating for the reservation be at 6:30 8:30 .<ssssss>there be long line to be seat .<ssssss>we last night , we stand in line for 45 minute wait to be seat and there be a empty table for we the entire time .<ssssss>not sure what the problem was.-when you pack , bring a swimsuit and summer clothing in you carry-on .<ssssss>while we room be available on time , we know of other who do not get room until much later and you likely will not have access to you luggage.-the front desk staff be not at all helpful and seem very indifferent .<ssssss>we room be not ready when we arrive since it be before check-in .<ssssss>the front desk person just put we wristband on and tell we to come back .<ssssss>that be all the direction we be give and we feel very lose .<ssssss>when you arrive , i would ask for -lrb- 1 -rrb- a map of the property and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the sheet which list the activity , entertainment , etc. for the day .<ssssss>keep in mind there be no information about the resort , restaurant , etc. in you room .<ssssss>when we have question , we find that the tour representative -lrb- ours be apple -rrb- speak the best english and be the most helpful .<ssssss>they be located at desk in the lobby .<ssssss>provide some write information to the customer upon arrival and in the room would go a long way to reduce some of the frustration.-the competition to obtain chair be fierce - especially at the beach .<ssssss>most chair be go by 9:30 am .<ssssss>we make it a habit to put towel on chair to reserve they right when we wake up in the morning .<ssssss>there be plenty of room for more chair and this be very much needed.-the mosquito in the room be very annoying .<ssssss>however , we be not so much bother by they while outside on the resort .<ssssss>i think the fumigation they do each day be work - except for in the room .<ssssss>the mosquito get in the room each day when the maid come to clean since they leave the door open .<ssssss>i would put you do not disturb sign out if you do not need you room clean to minimize the mosquito .<ssssss>you can also ask for spray -lrb- or bring some -rrb- at the front desk.-i would also make sure you obtain a do not distrub sign if you do not have one .<ssssss>it be not uncommon to be bother more than once early in the morning .<ssssss>there be the maid , the person who restock the fridge , and another person who come around to see who be in what room to see where the empty room were.-the room service menu be dissapointing .<ssssss>we be in the deluxe room and there be nothing hot on the room service menu .<ssssss>mostly bread , cheese , salad .<ssssss>- the casino and bowling alley be not open .<ssssss>they be do many spa service and they have some gym equipment -lrb- treadmill eliptical -rrb- in a temporary location.if you be book at a great price and can handle some frustration , book this hotel without worry .<ssssss>if you want a hotel that be without frustration , book elsewhere for now .<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 3 2 3 -1		5 star lobby but 3-star room we be seduce by the photo and description on kahala website and choose to stay at a dolphin lagoon room .<ssssss>we be disappoint .<ssssss>the room be of 3-star standard at best and although spacious , do not deserve the rate of about $ 600 -lrb- include tax -rrb- per night .<ssssss>the most annoying aspect be the noise from the upper floor room -lrb- and may be the neighbor room -rrb- .<ssssss>it be not just foot step but the roar of flash of toilet -lrb- the noise be similar to the suck sound of flash toilet on air plane -rrb- and sound of water hit the floor in the shower early morning and late at night .<ssssss>when i give my feedback at check-out , i be tell the management know some of the room have noise problem .<ssssss>when i say that they should have inform potential guest , i be tell that there be nothing they could do and i choose to stay in a ground floor room .<ssssss>meaning , it be my choice and hence i should bear with the noise from other rooms.if you plan to stay at a dolphin lagoon room , be warn of the noise , ask for a room roughly mid way from the lobby on the upper floor but away from the tower block -lrb- under renovation -rrb- , some of these room have ocean view too .<ssssss>but note that upper floor room be ` smoking room ' .<ssssss>overall service be polite and food quality be fair , not outstanding .<ssssss>the positive aspect be the spa treatment and dolphin quest .<ssssss>my kid have a great half a hour learning and interact with the dolphin as a christmas treat.we will not consider the kahala again .<ssssss>it be suppose to the highlight of we vocation before we ` down grade ' to hilton .<ssssss>how wrong we be .<ssssss>we leave feeling ` rip off ' and stress .<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 5 3 5 5		old habit die hard this be the third year in succession that i have stay at the gw .<ssssss>some of the other review i find puzzling as i have to say the service and accommodation be very good indeed .<ssssss>the food in the various restaurant could be best describe as adequate rather than exciting but for the business traveller the hotel represent good value -lrb- excellent in-room it -rrb- and be convenient for the airport .<ssssss>the small shopping area also sell thing you would probably want to buy and at least there be a proper bar area .<ssssss>the architecture be correctly describe in some of the other review though .<ssssss>it be quite simply awful with all the charm of a swindon call centre .<ssssss>perhaps best not to look to hard!one black mark be that on a previous visit a colleague have ask I to get a copy of a bill from a previous stay as he would have no luck in try to obtain this by correspondence .<ssssss>front desk management seem to understand what i be request but nothing be ever do despite various promise .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 3 4 5 3		hospitality at its best !<ssssss>i spend 5 night at the contiki resort and have the time of my life.coming from a hospitality background i can surely reccomend this hotel .<ssssss>it have a fantastic vibe and the staff that work there ooze with passion for they job and make you feel that you must enjoy you holiday and the bali environment .<ssssss>i meet a lot of interesting people from all over the world and all in all the resort add a lot to my holiday experience .<ssssss>lot of activity and entertainment be plan daily to bring people together and all meal be great.the room be comfy and i be impress with it as i be not expect a very comfy bed .<ssssss>one do not have to leave the resort for day as there be so much to enjoy and the pool be a winner !<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 4 -1 2 -1		overrate , be everybody review the same hotel ?<ssssss>i be not sure that everybody be revew the same hotel here .<ssssss>the affinia dumont be certainly not opposite penn station!i be extremely disappoint with the hotel , aside from the large room it do not really do much for I .<ssssss>despite a request when the booking be make -lrb- several month ago -rrb- for a high room with view we be on the 10th floor , they only have high floor available with single bed .<ssssss>no major problem but a little customer care go a long way .<ssssss>the concierge be actually whoever be on reception and in this instance be very poor , a request to confirm some restaurant reservation that we have make be note but not act upon , we discover this when the restaurant in question ring to confirm we reservation themselves several hour later .<ssssss>when we request information on get to the airport we be point to the station and tell that they could not call we a shuttle bus , we would have to do it ourselves!the room be large but old fashion , the air conditioning unit be very loud and i dread to think what it must be like during the summer .<ssssss>noise from adjoining room and across the hallway be especially prevalent , lot of hotel have lock adjoining door to room but the gap between they leave a lot to be desire and television and telephone conversation be clearly audible despite not be particularly loud and so much light come through from the neighbouring room that we have to block the doorway with towels.overall i be disappointed and would have prefer a smaller room with better service .<ssssss>i struggle to understand why this be even in the top ten hotel in new york , let alone rank number 3 !<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		you get what you pay for ... .<ssssss>after read the review we be expect a little bit better than we got.first of all the area it be very close to king cross and there be alot of backpacker property on the same road - plus side be there be a wide variety of cheap eating place if on a budget - minus side we didnt always feel safe walk home in the evening .<ssssss>the hotel itself look great from the outside but the room be look quite dated - the curtain and bedspead in we room be the same as i have at home in the late 80 's - i suppose we should have realise as no picture on they web site only pencil drawing .<ssssss>also on the room they have different standard of room but it be very unclear what extra facilite you get for the upgrade , i would advise you check exactly what you be get ... we be tell we room as slightly larger and have a view ... well there wasnt much room around the bed and we be on the main street which be a little bit noisy .<ssssss>breakfast be ok a choise of cerial and bread there isnt enough table in courtyard for all the room though so at time you may wait.advise - if you be on a budget and want a hotel rahter than a hostel it will be fine , if you go expect a beautiful hotel in a nice area you will be disapoint ... but you be in one of the most expensive city in the world for accommodation so i suppose you do get what you pay for<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 4 4 3		good location , facelift require .<ssssss>stay there five day in 2006 november .<ssssss>bedbreakfast .<ssssss>very convenient location - several subway station from center , no problem to get there by taxi even when the traffic be busy .<ssssss>get a very good view from we room - ancient tower with some old astronomy tool on top and old beijing city wall .<ssssss>but the room need radical repair - not terrible , but too out of date , especially the bathroom .<ssssss>room clean but not very clean .<ssssss>breakfast be ok , we have no problem .<ssssss>restaurant and service - very good .<ssssss>personnel - helpful .<ssssss>so the room finish and appliance be not 4 star , everything else - defintely be 4 star quality .<ssssss>a good place to drop you luggage and do beij sightseeing .<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 4 5 2		excellent all around i really like this hotel .<ssssss>very chic design and i find the staff to be very helpful -lrb- they even recommend a much better restaurant for paella than we travel agent -rrb- .<ssssss>the black toilet paper and red wall be fantastic and the bed be one of the most comfortable around.we be lucky enough to get a corner room on a high floor , so the noise be minimal and we have a excellent view.the only thing that be not 100 % be the wireless internet connection -lrb- which seem to be my problem with many hotel around europe -rrb- .<ssssss>i have to go to the second floor and find certain sweet spot to connect .<ssssss>i do not find the location to be bad either .<ssssss>there be great shop and restaurant on either side and the metro be nearby .<ssssss>it be also within walk distance to the prado -lrb- if you like to walk a bit -rrb- .<ssssss>

4 4 4 2 3 4 3 5		if you do not use you leg they will fall off !<ssssss>overall i like this place but then i be more than happy to do a lot of walk as i like to get down and dirty in any new city i visit .<ssssss>the main drawback be that this place be a good 20 min walk from downtown or any other main area -lrb- apart from lake union , of course -rrb- , and i know that there be a lot of people out there that be a bit reluctant to use they leg out there -lrb- if you do not use they they will fall off , by the way -rrb- .<ssssss>if that be you then do not go here : stay central .<ssssss>if however you like good value accomodation in a centrally accessable location , with good size comfortable room , and a nice little relax buffet breakfast with a view i would highly recommend this place .<ssssss>you might also consider the silver cloud in the university district if you be under 40 as the area be a little more interesting for bar and eaterie , but about the same distance from downtown .<ssssss>my main gripe would be the poor cheap lighting in the room by the mirror -lrb- you can always tell when you be in a higher star hotel - they have good lighting -rrb- - they make the bag under eye look really bad , man !<ssssss>ps - the free wireless be a excellent bonus .<ssssss>

4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		lovely stay at grand homme i choose this hotel because of its immaculate attention to empire/biedermeir decor and be amply justified to pay a bit extra for a room that almost transport I into a ingres painting : the wall cover with period fabric , the antique writing table and the mirror , the bas-relief over the bed , the crown molding , a charming lobby and a wind staircase all add authenticity and credibility to a spectacular view of the pantheon from we window .<ssssss>the bed -lrb- take up 3/4 of the room -rrb- be very comfortable , and the linen very soft and clean , although the little bed cover look a bit worn .<ssssss>despite the warning about the size of the room , i do not actually expect we room to be so tiny -lrb- hence above average and not excellent rating -rrb- , but it be ok for we purpose .<ssssss>the bathroom be very good , with a very clean , large , deep bath tub .<ssssss>at the checkout , i have the maid show I all the room on the 5th floor , and i actually prefer those without the view -lrb- they have a nicer lay out and larger bath with window -rrb- .<ssssss>all room have different wall covering and furniture piece , but the spirit of the epoque be well preserve .<ssssss>the location be great for we because we want to explore the latin quarter and st. germain .<ssssss>the rer station be 5 min walk .<ssssss>the famous right bank area -lrb- champ elysee , st. honore and monmartre -rrb- be easily accessible by subway .<ssssss>the staff be very nice and welcome -lrb- especially the breakfast room lady , the morning reception lady and the maid -rrb- .<ssssss>the evening staff could not recommend a restaurant serve food after 11pm or any dance club off the top of they head -lrb- i guess they job do not allow they to get out much at night -rrb- , but they be willing to do some i-net research for we .<ssssss>we end up have dinner at le port du salut right around the corner at 163 rue saint jacque , and it be one of we best meal in france -lrb- the maitre d' go out of he way to make this first meal in paris special and memorable for we -rrb- .<ssssss>overall , i be glad we stay at the grand homme because it convey the time period so well and would consider stay there again if the price be right .<ssssss>

terrible service and attitude we receive while we stay at this resort .<ssssss>the simple truth of the matter be all the negative and bad thing that happen to we while we be there outweigh all the good things.for starter , the layout of the resort be stupid .<ssssss>you have hotel on one side of the resort , and you have the restaurant and sport bar on the other side .<ssssss>to get to these attraction , you need to wait 10 minute for the train to come .<ssssss>then you need to find a seat on this packed train -lrb- or wait another 10 minute for the next one -rrb- , take a 15 minute train ride to the other side of the resort to visit one of the a la cart restaurant .<ssssss>once there , you will be tell that there be a wait time of anywhere from a hour to two hour -lrb- for a party of 5 -rrb- , and that you will need to take a pager and they will call you .<ssssss>oh yeah , they also donât take reservation -lrb- unless you stay in the suite -rrb- .<ssssss>sunchair .<ssssss>every review i read say there be plenty available and be not a issue .<ssssss>every morning someone from we group would wake up at 6:30 be to reserve 5 chair .<ssssss>otherwise , by 8am there be not a

a day .<ssssss>this be not a exaggerated number .<ssssss>sometimes youâd get up to go to the washroom and in a span of 100 meter 3 different people would come up to you with they binder try to get you to sign up for something.service overall be hit and miss .<ssssss>some of the waiter be very nice and we tip they extremely well .<ssssss>by far the best bartender on the entire resort be william .<ssssss>he usually work the swim up bar in the pool with the deep end .<ssssss>all the other bartender be hit and miss .<ssssss>sometimes the drink taste the same , sometimes they donât .<ssssss>thereâs no consistency .<ssssss>but thatâs just the bartender .<ssssss>the lobby waiter who ask you if you want a drink be nowhere to be see .<ssssss>thatâs more of management fault though because there be usually only one person work the entire lobby .<ssssss>restaurant waiter be hit and miss as well .<ssssss>browlio -lrb- who work at multiple restaurant -rrb- be the only good waiter in my opinion .<ssssss>the rest of the waiter be just do they job as far as iâm concern .<ssssss>the waitress in the mexican a la cart show up with this attitude and ask âyeah what do you wantâ?which be she way of say âHi welcome , what can i get for you?â?br / > the maid ... here be where thing get interesting .<ssssss>the room be nice , and relatively clean .<ssssss>but there be some issue .<ssssss>the bed cover be not wash between guest -lrb- you can tell because they smell funky -rrb- .<ssssss>the white bed sheet be clean though .<ssssss>towel be ridiculous .<ssssss>no consistency what so ever .<ssssss>one maid would come in the morning -lrb- 9am -rrb- to remove you towel .<ssssss>another maid would come later to give you fresh towel -lrb- hopefully -rrb- .<ssssss>i have a feeling they do thing this way because they didnât have enough towel to go around and would rewash the same towel every day .<ssssss>otherwise this be just impractical .<ssssss>another maid would come to make you bed and i guess tidy up .<ssssss>so when you tip the maid , iâm not sure who exactly get this money .<ssssss>two funny side note , 1 -rrb- there be a half drink bottle of beer next to my tv for the entire duration of my visit .<ssssss>one of the previous guest must have leave it there .<ssssss>i be curious to see how long it would take the maid to clean it .<ssssss>it be still there by the time i leave .<ssssss>2 -rrb- the maid donât knock -lrb- hola/hello housekeeping be not in they vocabulary -rrb- .<ssssss>one of my friend be on the toilet while the maid walk into the room and then the washroom -lrb- without knock on either door -rrb- .<ssssss>the room in general be quite nice .<ssssss>the picture be a little misleading though .<ssssss>the jacuzzi be you bathtub and it be in the washroom .<ssssss>in the picture i see prior to go , it be locate in you main room .<ssssss>this might be the case in the suite .<ssssss>not a huge deal , but it be a little disappointing.food .<ssssss>not bad , but not great .<ssssss>food be one of these thing that many of we might disagree on .<ssssss>what i might consider great , you might consider disgust , and vice versa .<ssssss>so iâll keep thing very generalize .<ssssss>the selection at the main buffet be great , but it be the same menu every day .<ssssss>everything be fry .<ssssss>pan fry , deep fried , it have a lot of oil .<ssssss>the a la cart be a bit better in term of quality .<ssssss>but try get into one without a reservation -lrb- one hour wait minimum if you show up after 7:30 pm -rrb- .<ssssss>i didnât get sick , but two of my friend do -lrb- 2 out of a group of 5 â?those arenât good odds -rrb- .<ssssss>on a side note â?take gravel , tum , pepto bismol with you .<ssssss>you will definitely need something for the heart burn after all those citrus alcoholic beverage and all the oil you will consume .<ssssss>there be a store in which you can buy these thing -lrb- as well as sunscreen , sunglass , clothes , souvenir , etc -rrb- , but be prepare to get rip off .<ssssss>tum which cost $ 2.50 cnd , be $ 11 usd there .<ssssss>sunscreen - $ 5 dollar here , $ 20 there.the shop in general be pretty stupid .<ssssss>very over price , bad service -lrb- big surprise -rrb- , and donât go by the hour in the window because they donât believe in they and neither should you .<ssssss>if youâre go to buy alcohol , wait until you get to the duty free in the airport.i could keep go , but i think iâve make my point .<ssssss>the negative outweigh the positive .<ssssss>all the thing that be suppose to make this resort a 4 star be not there.final point â?i would recommend this place to family because the staff love kid .<ssssss>this be very obvious and i be glad to see they treat someone right .<ssssss>i go on vacation with two couple .<ssssss>single guy â?this be not the resort for you .<ssssss>lol .<ssssss>i can not stress this point enough .<ssssss>punta cana be very much a couple / family destination .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 2 2 5		elegant hotel with very small dark room we stay at el convento for two night .<ssssss>the public area of the hotel be elegant , and the staff friendly and helpful - although not well-trained or efficient .<ssssss>when we inquire about the message light on we phone go on the second morning that we be there , and we not be able to access the message -lrb- we be expect a call from we son who be arrive later that day at the hotel -rrb- , the day staff at the hotel be not at all quick to try solve the problem and take several hour try to figure out the code to access the message -lrb- it should have be the arrival date , but be not -rrb- and finally determine that the message be a old message .<ssssss>they could not even figure out how to turn off the message light , so it keep on blinking .<ssssss>finally , in the evening , the desk clerk know exactly what to do , and fix the problem in a few seconds.the first room that we be take to be fairly large , but the air conditioner be obviously be work on -lrb- part of the ceiling insulation be on the floor -rrb- , and the bellhop immediately call the desk to assign we another room .<ssssss>that room be very small and dark - and not exceptionally clean .<ssssss>the time be get close to midnight , and after a delay flight and a time change of four hour , we just want to get to sleep.the wine and cheese hour be very nice with a nice selection of wine and cheeses.we love old san juan , and el convento be in a very convenient location .<ssssss>we be able to walk to san cristobal fort and take the free trolley to el morro fort .<ssssss>the hotel be close to the only remain city gate .<ssssss>it be also close to lot of shopping.go to la bombonera for breakfast -lrb- 259 calle san francisco -rrb- , and be sure to order a mallorca .<ssssss>it be about a five minute walk from the hotel .<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 5 3 3 -1		a little too clubby for I i have never stay at a w before , i have have many a martini at the san francisco w but never stay over night .<ssssss>the w seattle be not as impressive as the san francisco location .<ssssss>the lobby of the hotel be chop into two different section , reception and the living room lounge area .<ssssss>the reception be where you first enter and leave a lot to be desire .<ssssss>check in go smooth except that they stick we in a room that look out on to a parking garage -lrb- we ask for a nice view because it be my husband birthday -rrb- .<ssssss>once we be switch we be fine with we room -lrb- even though no assistance be offer to move we luggage -rrb- .<ssssss>the main problem that i have with this hotel be that i feel that it be try to be so hard to be cool and hip that they over do it .<ssssss>i mean who really want to walk into a blue dimly light hallway at 10am or listen to house music in the restroom when you be head out to breakfast .<ssssss>there be a time and place for these thing and the morning do not feel like that time.another strange thing that happen during we stay be that 20-30 young people be stay at the hotel -lrb- in they teens -rrb- and all the hallway reek of pot .<ssssss>one day they camp out in the lobby and be sprawl across the couch and by the fire draw picture , read magazine and on the floor take nap for hour .<ssssss>no other guest could access any part of this area during this time.although we get a great deal and the hotel be in very easy walk distance to everything , i would probably opt to stay at one of the many other hotel in the surround area .<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 3 4 4 2		need update the staff be friendly and helpful .<ssssss>the room be in need of refurbishment .<ssssss>my main complaint be the traffic noise -lrb- although i am much more fussy than normal about this sort of thing - other probably do not notice it -rrb- .<ssssss>but i think they should consider put in double glazing .<ssssss>
5 4 5 2 5 5 5 5		sleek and modern hotel outside central boston weâve just spend the weekend at the westin waterfront in boston celebrate we sonâs birthday .<ssssss>initially we be disappoint in not be able to find a hotel at a central location due to the marathon , but the hotel be so nice that it make the distance factor a mute point .<ssssss>the hotel be large -lrb- about 800 room -rrb- , sleek and modern .<ssssss>the lobby be dramatic and be pleasantly fill -lrb- even at 10:30 at night -rrb- with people socialize .<ssssss>check-in be a snap , in spite of the fact that the hotel be totally sell out .<ssssss>we room be spanking clean , modern and roomy .<ssssss>we bed be wonderfully comfortable , so much so that my husband , who be usually a very early riser , sleep until 9:30 the next morning .<ssssss>we have a huge flat screen tv , starbuck coffee and tea for the coffee maker and a variety of ultra-modern convenience .<ssssss>we bathroom be roomy and modern and have beautiful granite countertop and a stone floor .<ssssss>the pool , which we do not have the time to use , look beautiful .<ssssss>there be a starbuck in the lobby .<ssssss>check-out be also very easy .<ssssss>the employee be polite and helpful , include after put we two son in a room with a king size bed rather than two double as request .<ssssss>they be conscientious about security and insist that i come down to the registration desk to identify my son .<ssssss>i appreciate this detail , despite the fact that it require i get redress , after a recent experience in a luxury hotel where i be offer a friendâs room key by a hotel employee when she didnât answer she room phone .<ssssss>i would return to the hotel without hesitation , with the one concern be its out of the way location .<ssssss>there be public transportation right near by , but we never need to use it .<ssssss>my impression be that one get far more for the money by stay a bit out of the center of downtown boston .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 3 3 2 3		just ok for the price my family and i stay in a mediterranean suite for 3 night , and to begin with the location of le meridien be truly excellent -- close to sightseeing spot and metro stations!but other than that a few problem occur : the telephone in the room be out of service and be not fix .<ssssss>the suite lack a plasma tv -- a very mediocre cro tv with poor video quality .<ssssss>the furniture in the room be wear out!concierge be not properly staffed.fairly friendly staff thoughthe terrace of the suite be a big plus -- especially nice with sunny conditions.when you be pay 500 euro or so for a night , one would surely expect more from the hotel -- probably the room amenity and decoration would be better in the renovate room -- but still no excuse after the hotel have undergo a 30 million euro revamp!overall so so experience , might try h1898 just next to le meridien next time .<ssssss>

2 1 1 4 2 2 2 3		thoroughly irritating this be my third time stay in this property .<ssssss>i do not know how other people come to a five-star rating for this hotel , but i can assure this property be nowhere near that after three seperate visit .<ssssss>it be unfortunate my company be still book I in .<ssssss>swissotel have spend big money renovate the lobby , cafe and most common area .<ssssss>these place be lovely and well design , but that do not extend to the room .<ssssss>i be book into a non-smoking king-size room , and get check into a pokey twin bed room instead .<ssssss>when you get in , the first thing you realize be this awful smell of stale smoke .<ssssss>the carpet under you foot feel dirty , and when you go in to take a bath - the bathroom be underwhelmingly two-star standard that i can only relate to cheap motel in the we .<ssssss>there be little toiletries they provide - can i suggest you bring you own shampoo and toothpaste if you intend to stay ?<ssssss>they have the two-in-one stuff i hate more than anything.when you finish you bath , you would realize one or two towel come with a hole , and be small threadbare stuff that be be there for age .<ssssss>when you be do with that you go out and switch on the tv - it be the tiniest 14 inch that be still in the crt era .<ssssss>-lrb- i suspect there be other people like I , expect to relax infront of a plasma or lcd tv that be a bit bigger . -rrb-<ssssss>also , you know something be wrong when you need to pull the plug of the desk lamp for you laptop , and the broadband that you have be at a snail pace ... and when you get sleepy , you would realize the mattress be so damn hard that be actually prevent you from a proper sleep .<ssssss>you pull the duvet higher - and there be hole on the cover .<ssssss>-lrb- ?? -rrb-<ssssss>swissotel beijing have get a great lobby , but beyond there be little to suggest a pleasant stay .<ssssss>the rest of the staff appear ill-trained .<ssssss>a manager walk past I three time on my floor - no eye contact , he never even say hi or smile .<ssssss>they try to charge we double for a simple request of bourbon with ice in the lounge .<ssssss>-lrb- with the most stupid debate - sir you ask for ice , so that be double price because you get more -rrb- the front desk staff do not intend to any receipt when i check out until i ask for it - and they give I a wrong one.the most stupid one be when i ask to store my luggage on the last day - the bell boy tell I he can not take my luggage if there be a laptop in it .<ssssss>that really have blow my fuse , until a manager come over and explain he mean laptop be to be store in the manager ' safe.simple conclusion - fail to communicate through and through .<ssssss>for the same sum , i have a very enjoyable stay with sheraton in shanghai .<ssssss>i be just wait for sheraton to build something closer downtown in beijing , and when that happen - i would be happy to pay out of my pocket to get away from this awful place .<ssssss>

2 3 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		ok , but some significant failing i book this hotel due to the positive review post on this site but have to say that not all be as expect .<ssssss>on the whole i find the hotel to be less than average .<ssssss>i travel to madrid with my wife and baby daughter -lrb- 10mth -rrb- during july .<ssssss>this happen to coincide with one of the hottest weekend with temperature be well over the 40c range around midday .<ssssss>however the hotel do not have a ice machine .<ssssss>in order to get ice you have to pop down to the bar or restaurant and ask for ice which be generally provide in a plastic carrier bag !<ssssss>this wouldnt have be too much of a issue have it not be for the fact that although the room have air conditioning , it be clearly not strong enough to cool the whole room .<ssssss>my daughter struggle to sleep in the heat and have a number of restless night .<ssssss>we even notice that the air con be turn off during some hour -lrb- though usually when most guest be out sight see -rrb- .<ssssss>other problem we experience be : - the hotel be undergoung some renovation and so building work could be hear early in the morning -lrb- around 8am -rrb- - we could only receive 9 of the 16 tv channel .<ssssss>the staff claim that they only offer 9 channel when clearly the in room literature state 16 channel .<ssssss>- the room have a weird smell to it when you first enter .<ssssss>we do ask to move room but there werent any available .<ssssss>- the bathroom must have have very thin wall as you could hear what the people in the neighbouring room be up to -lrb- it be not pleaant ! -rrb-<ssssss>it wasnt all bad though .<ssssss>positive include : - good location .<ssssss>within walk distance to some of the key site .<ssssss>a burger king , pizza hut and subway within walk distance if you stomach can not handle the local delicacy .<ssssss>- only a few hundred yard to the nearest underground subway/metro - staff be very friendly and helpful.in summary , its a hotel that have a lot go for it , but sadly let we down in too many way and we wont be stay there if we ever return to madrid .<ssssss>

4 5 4 3 3 5 4 -1		satisfactory , could not complain the hotel be just perfect for the price that we pay .<ssssss>we book a standard room thru expedia for hk $ 500 per night .<ssssss>when we check in at the hotel , we get upgrade to superior room at the same price.room size be ok , not cramp at all .<ssssss>i think the bed be great , very comfortable .<ssssss>fridge be a good plus , to keep we water bottle cold .<ssssss>tv be good , too .<ssssss>there be a channel that show movie all day long , so my daughter be not bore while we relax in we room during mid-day .<ssssss>bathroom a bit small , but not too bad.we do not try the hotel 's restaurant .<ssssss>we always have breakfast at starbuck next door at knutsford.the hill/steps that lead up to the hotel be not too terrible , they be manageable enough .<ssssss>the 2 time we take a taxi , the driver drive we up to the lobby level -lrb- instead of just leave we on the corner of kimberly -rrb- .<ssssss>we book a victoria peak half-day tour with the hotel 's tour desk for hk $ 290/person .<ssssss>i think that be a slightly higher price than other tour operator i find in discoverhongkong website .<ssssss>but because it be convenient , i decide to go ahead with the hotel 's tour recommendation .<ssssss>when we get to the tour bus the next day , we be the only customer .<ssssss>so , it turn out to be a private hk island tour .<ssssss>it be great!we would recommend stanford hillview to other that be look for low-priced accomodation .<ssssss>we have a great time .<ssssss>
3 4 4 2 5 5 4 5		bit far from centre of barcelona i take my boyfriend away for a few day break and book a mystery hotel , the hotel itself be fantastic , the receptionist be really helpful but we find it quite far out from the rambler -lrb- centre -rrb- we have to catch a tram then a metro -lrb- take around 40 minute in total -rrb- which only bother we because we want to stay out late but the last tram be at 12 midnight -lrb- 2 a.m on week-end -rrb- i would recommend the hotel , but if i be to go to barcelona again i would stay somewhere alot closer as there be not many shop or restaurant around the hotel -lrb- and the food be quite expensive at the hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>we also get con in a taxi from airport -lrb- should cost no more than 20 euro -rrb- but we get charge 30 euro - so stand you ground !!<ssssss>other than that we have a fantastic time .<ssssss>
3 4 4 5 5 4 3 2		very good location , good staff , poor restaurant we stay at the hotel for 3 night , and location be very good and we where able to vist many different attraction .<ssssss>the staff some where more helpful than other but overall good .<ssssss>the restaurant be not very good quality food and very experience , there seem to a bit of lack of thing to do in hotel , like internet , pool .<ssssss>also the price of the massage , etc be well too much.i would recommend it if you can get a cheap price .<ssssss>
3 5 3 5 4 5 -1 3		convenient choice in hong kong i have stay at the kowloon hotel a few time over the year .<ssssss>as many point out , the room be very small and get a bit dated -- although clean and comfortable .<ssssss>these be about the only drawback i can think of .<ssssss>it be a extremely convenient location , especially if you be spend most of you time in kowloon , but the mtr station , harborfront and ferry terminal be all also only a short walk -lrb- actually the mtr be under the hotel -rrb- so go anywhere be pretty easy .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be terrific , and service , even in this very busy hotel , be excellent.if you plan to spend a lot of time in you hotel room , want a great view or be look for a romantic resort setting , choose a different hotel .<ssssss>if you value convenience and cost with capable , efficient service , this be a good choice .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		pack ear-plug book this hotel a month before travel , have be tempt by the fact that room be ` soundproof ' and location be central .<ssssss>the hotel only live up to the latter of these claim .<ssssss>we arrive at 5pm on friday 21st april to celebrate a birthday the follow day and be allocate a room on the 4th floor , face the side-street , just off dam square - good size , with a nice bathroom and two single bed , one pillow each .<ssssss>i would ask for a quiet room , with king size bed and a view if possible - my priority be in that order .<ssssss>we get lovely view of the rooftop .<ssssss>but what none of the review mention be the carnival/funfair on dam square .<ssssss>it be impossible to escape the noise until it stop at 11:30 pm on the friday night and then again at midnight on saturday .<ssssss>but below the hotel room be a sidestreet with a burger king which open late and must be use as a spot for night-reveller to get a feed .<ssssss>so there be lot of scream and shout all night - so on the friday night we get little or no sleep - it be hard for the hotel to claim the room be soundproof when streetnoise permeate the window -lrb- they might as well have be open all night -rrb- .<ssssss>the breakfast be not include , but we try it on the final morning .<ssssss>arrive 30 mintue before breakfast cease there be no scambled egg leave , the bacon and bean be dry and unappealing so we go for cereal , juice , tea and toast .<ssssss>â ?<ssssss>4 euro for two people be a rip off .<ssssss>go out to the many cafÃ©s surround the hotel for a cheaper alternative -lrb- and a better selection -rrb- .<ssssss>have pay â ?<ssssss>00 for two night , one of which we barely sleep , put a dampener on the birthday celebration - we be simply exhaust .<ssssss>not recommend for any light sleeper , or those on trans-atlantic flight .<ssssss>unless you pack ear-plug or sleep tablet .<ssssss>
2 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		too much hype - vip access only have high expectation for this hotel , travel to la about 12-15 time a year so , with all the recent hype , i think maybe this beautiful landmark would replace my usual west hollywood spot , but when i have people over , i be tell that hotel guest be not aloud to use the bar -lrb- apparently it be close every night private party â?you be not even able to go outside and enjoy sit by the pool in the evening -rrb- and be instruct to go down to the hotel down the street and use they bar .<ssssss>my immediate response be âwhy didnât i just stay there then?â?the rest of my experience be nice enough but definitely didnât meet up to the level of any number of other hotel in the area â ?<ssssss>-lrb- they donât even have a website -rrb- .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 1 4		bed bug !!!!<ssssss>i select the aparthotel acacia base on the review on trip advisor .<ssssss>i need a room for three person and the aparthotel acacia be the highest rate hotel that sleep three.the location be in a residential area not a tourist area .<ssssss>but with a metro stop located so nearby - access to barcelona be easy .<ssssss>the room be large by european standard with a small refrigerator and kitchenette .<ssssss>wi-fus be free.but my concern involve bed bug !<ssssss>the morning follow we first night there - i notice four bite on my stomach .<ssssss>but as i have never in my year of travel experienced bed bug , i think nothing of the bite .<ssssss>we spend all day out see the site and go to a late dinner .<ssssss>when we return for the night , i wen to change into my bed clothes and realize that i be cover with bite on my torso - almost 90 of they !!<ssssss>we be tire and wear out from we first full day in spain but there be no way that i could sleep in that room -lrb- 401 -rrb- .<ssssss>i call to the front desk tell they of the bed bug bite and they give we another room .<ssssss>we pack up all of we belongings and move to the 6th floor .<ssssss>just as we be unpack everything , we be call and tell that we need to move to another room .<ssssss>by the time that we get move and settle and all key down to the front desk - it be 1:30 .<ssssss>my husband be tired and frustrated and talk to the front desk about compensation - he ask for one night on a five night stay and the front desk tell he that he could not authorize it but he be sure that we could do something agreeable.i be freak out , i spend time research bed bug on the internet .<ssssss>and the news be not pleasant .<ssssss>they be difficult to see and terrible to get rid of .<ssssss>they be not necessarily cause by a lack of cleanliness but actually travel with people on they luggage .<ssssss>they hide and come out a hour before dawn .<ssssss>they be very transient and move from room to room and can live for 18 month without feed but typically feed every 4-5 night .<ssssss>needless to say i do not sleep well that night or during we stay there.in hindsight , we should have move hotel but it be a busy easter weekend and find a room for three person would be difficult.the next morning i go down to the front desk and speak with the day manager .<ssssss>i even show he a photo of my back with the bite to show that they do exist .<ssssss>i want to know that they take I seriously and treat room 401 extensively .<ssssss>when we return from that day of touring , i be tell that they do not have bug .<ssssss>they do not allow animal in they hotel and that they hotel be very clean .<ssssss>they offer I a 5 % discount or 35 euro not because they believe there to be bed bug but because they have incovenience we and have we move twice - ha !<ssssss>- what a joke.i try to contact the hotel owner directly to ensure that he be aware of my concern and to ask for further compensation .<ssssss>but i receive no response.my bite do not multiply but do continue to get moe uncomfortable and affect my pleasure in the vacation .<ssssss>my husband and daughter also wind up with several bite on they .<ssssss>i continue to read about bed bug and how to keep from take they home with I .<ssssss>bed bug be nasty - people actually move from they home because they can not get rid of them.upon we arrival home - we be force to wash everything in the hottest possible water and dry for 20 minute .<ssssss>everything and i mean everything be seal and sterilize or freeze , they even have be know to get into computer so nothing be safe from bed bug .<ssssss>i have do everything possible to stop the contamination of my home.but i want to warn future traveller to beware of aparthotel acacia .<ssssss>even the cleanest of hotel can suffer with bed bug .<ssssss>and if the aparthotel acacia do not take my situation seriously and treat not only room 401 but the entire hotel as recommend by pest control specialist - the bed bug infestation will only continue .<ssssss>

5 5 4 5 5 3 3 3		beautiful little inn we stay at the coral princess inn last weekend , after read several review on this site .<ssssss>the location be great , extremely central in the condado area , just 1,5 block away from the marriott hotel , and two block from the beach .<ssssss>walgreen be right around the corner , for any little grocery .<ssssss>be a manager in a 4-star renaissance hotel in the caribbean , i can say that i know where i be talk about : the hotel have a small reception , with staff that be helpful , and be willing to do a extra step for you .<ssssss>the 25 room be among 3 floor , of which the topfloor be the nicest , with the biggest room -lrb- suite -rrb- , some sort of live room -lrb- nicely maintain -rrb- , a pooltable , and a outside area with loungchair and a jacuzzi .<ssssss>on the ground floor , where we room be located , the place be full of plant , -lrb- maybe even too full -rrb- , which give a very comfortable cozy atmosphere .<ssssss>breakfast happen there , on nicely maintain furniture.the room we be in be nr .10 , which be actually a room for disabled , so we have no jacuzzi but a shower , which work out ok .<ssssss>the hotel be full , so there be no choice as to stay in that room .<ssssss>the room have a fridge , microwave , a tv , a good airco-unit , but no cutlery in the drawer under the microwave ... the fridge be fill with some beverage , which be very cheap -lrb- $ 1 , - for soda , $ 2 , - for beer -rrb- .<ssssss>the turndown service be up to 4/5 star standard , with daily refreshment of towel , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>moreover , which be in my opinion the most important , the place be clean and well maintain , both inside as outside the rooms!the breakfast , which be include , consist daily -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>of : oj , coffee , milk , flake , croissant , 3 kind of pastry , ham/cheese , yoghurt , marmelade , banana .<ssssss>good enough to start you day with .<ssssss>but for a week stay it would be a little boring.the one little difficulty be parking , with only four spot in front of the hotel .<ssssss>my puerto rican friend have to park she car everytime on parking lot magdalena , which be one block away , and be $ 10,65 for 24 hour .<ssssss>that be the best deal you can get closeby , or you might wan na choose to go and find yourself a spot in the nearby streets.if you be use to big hotel and robotic service , go to those place , and pay double of what you pay here ; a nice , cozy and clean -lrb- ! -rrb-<ssssss>place , on a great location and top value for money .<ssssss>have fun !!<ssssss>

2 2 3 5 2 3 1 1		the restaurant/bar service be awful the hotel itself be quite charming , but the service at the restaurant and bar be so awful it almost ruin the whole trip .<ssssss>the hotel be old , and though bathroom pipe clog and lightbulb seem to go out left and right , it be somewhat tolerable and even expect .<ssssss>what be not tolerable and expect , however , be the crass , rude behavior of the bar that be endorse by the management.while i know it be not necessarily normal to let a single person ruin a whole weekend , the man standing behind the bar manage to do just that .<ssssss>we ask to borrow a few extra wine glass to bring to the room .<ssssss>he be stand in front of several dozen in a empty room and say emphatically no , he do not have enough to give .<ssssss>he change we for thing that we never get .<ssssss>when we go to talk about it with he , he roll he eye and act as if we be in the wrong .<ssssss>much more disturbing be the response of the management when we complain .<ssssss>the hotel manager , who be sit at the bar late on a saturday night , state that the bartender be not rude .<ssssss>she simply tell we we be wrong .<ssssss>though the man be incredibly rude , unhelpful and unfriendly , accord to the manager , he be not .<ssssss>there be no apology for what we feel to be bad behavior .<ssssss>there be no attempt to listen to we story or empathize with we experience .<ssssss>

4 4 4 -1 2 -1 3 -1		a few thing to keep in mind ... i like the white swan , i will stay there again .<ssssss>i find all the feature cite by other very nice , e.g. , breakfast , happy-hour , etc.but in spite of all the glowing report here , there be a few thing to remember .<ssssss>first , the white swan be a boutique hotel ; it be not a 4 star hotel -lrb- in fact , they call themselves a 3 star -rrb- .<ssssss>accordingly , the decor be not of a particularly high standard , e.g. , the bed be not of the quality one would find in a hyatt or even a marriott.i stay in room 41 on the front , friend stay in room 55 towards the back .<ssssss>my room be larger , but the bathroom be tiny .<ssssss>i mean tiny ; the sink area be so small that i could not get my shoulder square in front of the sink .<ssssss>the bathtub be also narrower than the standard we tub meaning i have to shower stand a bit sideways .<ssssss>the bathroom also could have use a thorough cleaning -lrb- there be hair on the wall behind the door and a bit of black mold grow on the tile in the tub surround -rrb- .<ssssss>that say , i do not spend a great deal of time in the bathroom.our room have a few minor problem .<ssssss>one of the lamp be miss the bulb , the fireplace keep go on and off , and the toilet do not function properly .<ssssss>on report to the front desk , the bulb be replace but the other problem be not address during we 3 day stay .<ssssss>on the morning of we departure the toilet give up for good - oh , the poor room cleaner!my major problem be the noise , not the basic traffic , but the garbage truck early in the morning .<ssssss>soundproof window do not cost that much and i do not understand why more hotel do not invest in they for at least the window at the front .<ssssss>report from the guest at the back be that noise be not so much a problem there .<ssssss>

3 4 4 4 4 2 2 1		pretty good , especially for the cost .<ssssss>hotel room<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 5 3 3 4		the good i recently book a room for four night at the hotel california through hotwire .<ssssss>naturally , room book through hotwire be less desirable , which explain my second floor interior room face the alley .<ssssss>i really do not mind the fact that my room face the alley -- in fact , i be glad as i assume that would help cut down on the street noise .<ssssss>however , i digress .<ssssss>let I point out the good point of the hotel california : location -- you be less than three block from all the action of union square .<ssssss>very centrally located and easily accessible to all other point of the city via public transportation .<ssssss>some reviewer mention the safety of the neighborhood -- i think the neighborhood be fine , even at night .<ssssss>i never feel threaten or fearful for my safety .<ssssss>however , you be just a few block away from the shady/seedy tenderloin district of san francisco .<ssssss>so be sure you be know where you be go , direction-wise .<ssssss>value -- a very good value , especially when book through hotwire or other off-price venue -lrb- priceline -rrb- .<ssssss>however , you have no idea what hotel you be book until you pay .<ssssss>compare to most hotel rate in san francisco , i feel i snag a real bargain.the bed !<ssssss>-- the bed in my room be by far one of the most comfortable bed i have ever sleep in .<ssssss>they have more than enough pillow -lrb- six pillow for one queen size bed -rrb- and the sheet and down comforter be what you would typically find at more high end hotels.free internet access be available to guest in the hotel lobby -- a nice touch when you want to look up the weather , local restaurant , direction , etc.room comfort/amenities -- the room , although small -lrb- but perfectly standard for san francisco -rrb- , be cozy and well appoint with bright yellow wall , unique art print and polish hardwood floor .<ssssss>the room be very clean and also boast a decent closet with a iron and iron board and in-room safe .<ssssss>the room also have a small write desk as well as a dresser and the usual coffee maker , ice bucket , television , etc. the plantation shutter shades be a nice touch , however they do tend to let a good bit of light in -lrb- not good if you like the room nice and dark -rrb- .<ssssss>clean and functional bathroom -- the bathroom be small , but perfectly functional .<ssssss>however , the bathroom do need to be update -lrb- the lighting fixture be rusting over and the toilet seat be chip and wear -rrb- .<ssssss>nice lobby and fairly friendly staff -- the lobby complement the feel of the hotel .<ssssss>the staff for the most part be professional and courteous , however they be not overly friendly .<ssssss>the hotel staff 's personality/attitude do not affect my stay , however , i think i would point it out .<ssssss>i will say that if you have a question or a request , they do they best to answer/honor it.wine and cheese -- every afternoon from 4:00 - 6:00 p.m. , the hotel offer wine , cheese and fruit to guest .<ssssss>that be a nice touch.now for the bad of hotel california : room noise -- by far , the worst aspect of the hotel and room be the noise one experience .<ssssss>although the hardwood floor be pretty to look at , they do nothing to mask the noise of footstep up above you .<ssssss>for some reason , the guest directly above I decide to walk around they room non-stop for two hour -lrb- from 11:00 p.m. - 1:00 a.m. -rrb- every night .<ssssss>they also enjoy drop shoe -lrb- or something heavy -rrb- on to the floor every 15-20 minute .<ssssss>the wall of the room be very thin and you can hear every word of you next door neighbor ' conversation -lrb- which do provide some entertainment -rrb- .<ssssss>same go with the hallway ; it sound like the people in the hallway be walk right through you room .<ssssss>apparently , there be very little or no insulation in the hotel.room darkness -- due to my room 's location -lrb- mine be a interior room on the second floor that be less than a foot from the hotel 's skylight -rrb- , the skylight that be directly beneath my window have a constant light on that totally light up my room every night -lrb- it be like the bat-signal shine directly in you room -rrb- .<ssssss>i have to go out and purchase a eye mask at walgreen 's down the street after the first night .<ssssss>the handsome plantation shutter , although pretty to look at , do little to filter the light from the skylight below .<ssssss>also , whenever the neighbor directly across the alley turn on they bathroom light , my room would light up even more .<ssssss>needless to say , between the light and sound situation , i find it very difficult to sleep .<ssssss>i think this also have to do with the room location .<ssssss>but that be what you get when you book through hotwire -lrb- the less or least desirable room -rrb- .<ssssss>then again , it be hard to beat hotwire 's rates!one final note , i be not offer the frosted tequila shot when i check in .<ssssss>i be not bother by this as i really do not care for tequila .<ssssss>i be not sure if this be a oversight , but just think i would mention it as i notice other reviewer mention the same thing.overall , the value and location of the hotel far outweigh the negative of the hotel california .<ssssss>just be prepare to know what you be get yourself in for .<ssssss>if you be look for a charming , unique boutique hotel with ton of character and personality , this be the place for you .<ssssss>if you be a light sleeper , be sure to bring the earplug and eye mask.finally , i will close my review by state that i would stay at the hotel california again , but only if i could be guarantee a room on they top floor , which should eliminate the non-stop footstep noise from above.enjoy san francisco -- it be a wonderful city !<ssssss>
4 5 5 3 5 1 5 1		great choice - very modern i would have rate this hotel as excellent have a couple of thing be different .<ssssss>there be a very rude , female , desk clerk name sonia , who i could have live without , and i could never get my laptop to work , but , everything and everybody else be great !<ssssss>gorgeous public area and room , very modern , great airconditioning , great restaurant and bar .<ssssss>the staff be amazingly gracious , helpful and friendly .<ssssss>and i do not think it be too far away from the main attraction .<ssssss>i be 52 year old , and i walk to the ponte vecchio in about 15 minute .<ssssss>the david be even closer .<ssssss>if you do not want to walk , rent a taxi -- they be cheap<ssssss>
3 2 2 2 5 3 3 -1		beautiful for a price ... .<ssssss>my husband and i just return from a 3 night stay at the caribe hilton hotel in beautiful san juan , puerto rico .<ssssss>i have be travel to puerto rico all of my life and use to stay in the caribe hilton in the 1970 's -1980 's .<ssssss>the hotel recently undergo rennovation in the lobby .<ssssss>the rennovation be nice but to I i feel that the hotel have lose a lot of it be puerto rican charm .<ssssss>it seem to have become a mega resort .<ssssss>what i mean by that , be that it be not anymore a tranquil hotel as i remember from my youth but be now a bustling resort with too many people and extremely high price .<ssssss>we stay in a garden room on the 10th floor .<ssssss>we have a beautiful view of the garden below , the beautiful sea surround we and the historic fort .<ssssss>the room be pretty well maintained although i do think they can use some rennovation .<ssssss>the first and last night that we stay at the hotel be very nice and quiet .<ssssss>however the 2nd night of we stay be horrible .<ssssss>i can not say it be the fault of the hotel but the people stay around we .<ssssss>they be slam the door all night long which of course make it very difficult to sleep .<ssssss>on we first day there we arrive around lunch time and have lunch in the grille .<ssssss>the food be very good and the lunch menu be pretty reasonable .<ssssss>we also decide to have dinner there .<ssssss>they offer different buffet every night of the week and although the food look good we decide to order off of the menu .<ssssss>the dinner be o.k. and again the price be o.k. on we second day we decide to have breakfast also in the grille .<ssssss>well , this be where they really get you .<ssssss>when we first sit down they do not give we a menu .<ssssss>there be however a menu on the table .<ssssss>the menu only show 2 or 3 option and then the $ 20.50 buffet .<ssssss>well we be not huge eater and so do not want to spend the $ 20.50 for the small amount of food we would be eat .<ssssss>we be about to leave when my husband ask if that be all they serve .<ssssss>at that point , the waiter say , oh , no , we have another menu .<ssssss>i be assume from what happen to we , that they try to get everyone to order the buffet so they do not give the full menu unless you ask for it .<ssssss>well , needless to say , we order from the regular menu and to be perfectly honest , we end up spend the same amount that we would have spend have we order the buffet .<ssssss>for a order of french toast , egg , orange juice and a cup of coffee it end up cost we over $ 40.00 .<ssssss>we have stay in many resort of this kind and even larger one and have never , ever pay anything like that for breakfast .<ssssss>with that be say , i feel like they definitely take advantagebecause there be not a lot of place to go that be near the hotel .<ssssss>fortunately , there be a starbuck in the lobby and although you can not get a hot breakfast from they at least you can get something to hold you over for breakfast and not spend a ton of money .<ssssss>we opt to eat breakfast at starbuck for the remainder of we stay and it actually be quite good .<ssssss>if you be look for puerto rican cuisine in the condado area , we eat at 2 pretty good restaurant for dinner .<ssssss>the first be ajili mojilus .<ssssss>it be pretty moderately price and the atmosphere and most important the food be very good .<ssssss>the other place i would recommend would be ropa vieja .<ssssss>if you only have one night to eat in the condado area then this be the place i would say to visit .<ssssss>the atmosphere be really nice and the food be wonderful .<ssssss>check out the spa at the normandie hotel , right next to the caribe hilton .<ssssss>although it be a very small spa , the service be excellent and the price be very reasonable.all in all , the caribe hilton be a beautiful resort , but due to the high price , crowd and location , in the future i will probably opt for a different hotel for my stay in the san juan area .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 3 5 -1 3		great location in the french quarter !<ssssss>this be a great hotel in three 19th century townhouse just off beinville in the french quarter .<ssssss>we have a corner room on the 4th floor with three balcony .<ssssss>the room be fairly spacious and the hotel provide free wifus .<ssssss>the bathroom be the standard smallish holiday inn variety but be certainly serviceable.the desk staff be friendly and helpful and the price , $ 125/night for a king room be a great deal for this location .<ssssss>no , this be not a w style luxury sleep but if you want character and a hotel that be within walk distance of royal street shopping and dining this be a excellent value .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		hot air if you be look for the basics this be for you .<ssssss>if you want any luxury you will be disappointed.negatives - very weak air conditioning .<ssssss>we have to change room 2 time .<ssssss>then order a extra fan to boost power .<ssssss>i be a native texan and can handle the heat .<ssssss>bad sign .<ssssss>no elevator in the garage .<ssssss>so after parking we have to walk we luggage down the ramp 3 story .<ssssss>small room .<ssssss>building be old and so be the decorpositive - clean , staff be friendly and responsive , great location .<ssssss>
2 1 1 3 5 3 1 1		key to why the rating be so incongruous i stay in a suite .<ssssss>it be large , like it be promise .<ssssss>it be clean and the staff be very courteous .<ssssss>however : * the furnishings be cheap * the wet bar be a crappy kitchenette that have be poorly convert into a half-ass mini-bar that be very ill-equipped .<ssssss>* i have repairmen come to my room 3 time in the first day because so many thing be break -lrb- toilet , internet jack , curtain -rrb- * the tv be at least 15 year old , and that pretty much represent the feel of the whole place.if you want a large suite , this place will do .<ssssss>if you want luxury -- which be what i want -- this hotel suck horribly .<ssssss>i kick myself for not go with the standard hotel i stay in : the ritz-carlton , which be the same price.why do the property have great rating ?<ssssss>well , apparently , if you stay on the club floor it be not a run down has-been hotel .<ssssss>if only i know .<ssssss>but honestly , give I the ritz .<ssssss>the hotel amenity be not that nice , either .<ssssss>basically , what i be say be : avoid this hotel .<ssssss>
2 3 2 3 4 5 4 3		mayflower have some `` thorns '' stay at the mayflower for a 2 day business meeting on june 5 and 6th .<ssssss>advice to meeting planner : think twice of have a meeting if over 70 participant will be at you function .<ssssss>the hotel be overwhelm .<ssssss>initially , the plymouth room , they largest conference room , which be under the lobby be attractive , but can only handle 8-9 table of 8-10 people .<ssssss>secondly , the men room be up the stair , across the lobby and down the stair on the other side -- only the woman 's restaurant be adjacent to the meeting room .<ssssss>finally , get everyone 's luggage out after the meeting be too much for 2 people .<ssssss>chaos ensue for those run to catch a plane.as far room go , i be tell i have a upgrade -lrb- room 321 -rrb- .<ssssss>apparently , i have a little more bathroom space .<ssssss>unfortunately , the upgrade end there , since i have a view of the hotel aircondition unit , light well and have the hotel 's mechanical power supply and hydraulic unit kick on every few minute do not allow a great night sleep .<ssssss>if you be give a room that look into the lightwell , turn around and ask for a room that front the street .<ssssss>you will be sleepless in seattle and highly disappointed if you dont.while most review , sound good for the most part , i want tripadvisor member to be aware of some of the issue of this 80 year old hotel .<ssssss>finally , make sure you allow for 15-20 minute for valet .<ssssss>you car could be block away .<ssssss>oh , by the way , they charge $ 28.00 a day .<ssssss>
2 1 3 5 2 3 2 -1		over-priced , poorly think through amenity if you be male , not allergic to feather , and tolerant of small amount of dirt in high price hotel , then this hotel may be for you .<ssssss>if you do not have a feather allergy , the bed be fantastic .<ssssss>even with the feather mattress topper strip off , it be extremely comfortable and extremely large with no roll together and no transmission of you other half 's fidget .<ssssss>unfortunately , in two night , they best replacement for the feather mattress topper , pillow and duvet , be three tatty non-feather pillow and a couple of blanket which it take 30 minute and two phone call to get -lrb- one of which the chambermaid take away when she come , without replace it with the request non-feather duvet , lead to yet another later night phone call to get enough bedding to sleep in back -rrb- .<ssssss>this be also the only hotel i have ever be in that consider one sanitary bag the appropriate number for each 24 hour -lrb- and the bathroom bin have no lid -rrb- .<ssssss>the small amount of dirt be -lrb- hopefully -rrb- squashed and smeared insect both in the bathroom and on the blackout blind .<ssssss>the blackout blind be very effective.the hotel do not suffer from traffic noise , but if you be sensitive to noise , get a room away from the lift , as you can hear other people talk as they go back to they rooms.the decor be beauiful , and the staff attentive - unless you want something more complicated than help use the lift .<ssssss>overall though , at that price , i would expect the room to be spotless and for they to be able to cater to a feather allergy better and quicker .<ssssss>other luxury hotel be clearly aware of the problem and cater to it more efficiently and appealingly .<ssssss>
3 1 3 5 3 1 3 3		i would pass on this hotel -- not representative of starwood .<ssssss>stay here only if you like lot of noise , crowd , have fairly low standard , and get a deal .<ssssss>my experience here be much different than at other starwood hotel .<ssssss>this be a huge convention hotel and hotel for people leave on cruise .<ssssss>i suspect they pay very little for they room .<ssssss>bus of people constantly arrive while we be there for a 3 night stay .<ssssss>parking be $ 35 a night .<ssssss>if i do it again , i would look for a small boutique hotel .<ssssss>i book 2 room via starwood 's website several week in advance of my stay .<ssssss>i be starwood gold .<ssssss>i call the hotel in advance and ask for 2 room connect or adjacent on the club level , in a quiet area .<ssssss>i do not get a deal .<ssssss>when check in , there be probably 100 people in line -- no joke .<ssssss>fortunately there be a separate line for gold and platinum member .<ssssss>we be tell we could not have adjacent room -- they be on separate floor .<ssssss>we be not offer a upgrade .<ssssss>the room be not ready at 2:45 p.m. -lrb- gold get early check-in -rrb- .<ssssss>fortunately a big tip to a porter get we adjacent room on the club level , but in a very noisy area -- right next to the club lounge and elevator that ding nonstop and feature a record lady 's voice you be on the 32nd floor .<ssssss>parking be $ 35 a night .<ssssss>the workout room be dreary and in bad need of update .<ssssss>the pool area look a bit dated and sad .<ssssss>it be a big pool with enough chlorine to make you itch for week .<ssssss>you can not call for you car in advance -- you wait at the valet for a long time before they will pull it around .<ssssss>i will pass next time !<ssssss>

1 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		not what expect for the price the dominican republic be a beautiful country to visit , however the paradisus need to make some adjustment before i ever go back .<ssssss>the resort itself be not the problem .<ssssss>it be the royal service that the club offer .<ssssss>it be way overrate .<ssssss>you do not get what you pay for .<ssssss>we never hear from we butler except for the first day that we arrive .<ssssss>all we information about the area come from a employee that we run into in the front lobby name miguel .<ssssss>this be what the butler be suppose to do .<ssssss>if it have not be for he , we would not have know which restuarant to eat in and what time you could even go there .<ssssss>the time we call for we butler he never call back or they would tell we he be not there .<ssssss>we never speak to he beyond the first day .<ssssss>they also tell you that when you have royal service you can call they for room service .<ssssss>this be a joke .<ssssss>every time we call vip , we be tell to call room service .<ssssss>we also have to stay on the fartherest side of the resort .<ssssss>the private beach area be on the opposite side .<ssssss>we find that it be easier to stay on the side that we room be on .<ssssss>the reason for this be because the resort be in the process of build the private pool for vip .<ssssss>this mean that they have the area block off that lead to the private beach .<ssssss>you have to then walk the long way around and then go back to the beach area .<ssssss>we do go to the private beach area once needless to say we do not go back for the above reason but also because the service you get be nonexistant .<ssssss>they come around once and ask we what we want to drink .<ssssss>plus anyone have access to this beach .<ssssss>the only difference between the two beach area be the chair in the private beach area be more comfortable .<ssssss>overall the beach be clean and well keep .<ssssss>the reservation that be make for you at the restuarant , you can make yourself .<ssssss>you do not need they to make this for you.our butler also do not inform we about the pillow menu .<ssssss>we do not find the form for this until 10 minute before check out .<ssssss>also we be not tell anywhere by anyone that if you make a credit card call or a call card call from you room , you will be charge 60 peso per call for a connection fee .<ssssss>this can add up in a hurry especially when you be unaware of this charge .<ssssss>by the way , if anyone have horseback ride experience , i recommend skip this part of the excursion that be include in the price .<ssssss>the reason be because if you have any experience you will find the excursion lack .<ssssss>most , except for about 2 , of the horse be nag and in very poor condition .<ssssss>they never get beyond the back-beating trot .<ssssss>i have ride horse for 30 year and this be the most excurciating experience of my life .<ssssss>my horse like to have beat I to death and they be like a bunch of pack mule .<ssssss>we also have to go to several other resort to pick up people to go ride also .<ssssss>we trip be suppose to take 1 hour and it end up take 3 hour .<ssssss>i would also like to tell anyone not to use future vacation who use club caribe as they representative .<ssssss>we be 4 woman , who do not speak any spanish , travel alone and nobody show up at the airport to pick we up .<ssssss>this be a little nerve rack .<ssssss>they never be at the hotel when they be suppose to be .<ssssss>we never see we representative with club caribe except for the day after we arrive and be tell that he would take care of everything .<ssssss>we call he every day thereafter and he never show up to meet with we like he schedule .<ssssss>we be not able to book any excursion nor do any activity try to meet up with he to confirm we flight .<ssssss>for example , we have a excursion for snorkele that be include in the price schedule for saturday and we representative say that he could meet with we between 10:30 am and 11:30 am , so we cancel we snorkeling trip -lrb- which be we last day -rrb- to meet with this person and he never show .<ssssss>the night before we leave he tell we on the phone that we just need to take a taxi .<ssssss>we have the resort call for a taxi and we arrive at the airport on time .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 2 2 -1		chic hotel my partner and i spend four night in october at the amrath and love it .<ssssss>we stay in a junior suite with a canal view and be really gobsmack by the dramatically high vaulted ceiling , the wall of huge window , and the beautifully appoint furnishings .<ssssss>the bathroom be awesome and the free mini-bar be a definite plus .<ssssss>breakfast be excellent .<ssssss>the spa be nice , though could use more fitness equipment .<ssssss>my one gripe be that the front desk and concierge staff be aloof if not altogether useless .<ssssss>the concierge be clueless .<ssssss>he unwisely advise we against purchase the âI amsterdamâ?card -lrb- which would have save we serious money -rrb- ; give we completely wrong information about the cityâs major museum and the canal cruise ; and , most annoyingly , didnât even know that there be a historic windmill within walk distance of the hotel .<ssssss>in fact , he insist we be wrong !<ssssss>-lrb- we werenât . -rrb-<ssssss>a 5-star hotel really need a 5-star staff .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 5 5 5 5		a bad night 's sleep we stay at this hotel for 3 night .<ssssss>it be very central , just 5 minute walk from darling harbour.the service from all the staff be very professional .<ssssss>the room be extremely clean .<ssssss>.<ssssss>however , the bed be very uncomfortable .<ssssss>my husband who like a firm mattress also find the bed too hard .<ssssss>there be a option on the pillow menu to have a foam underlay but when i ring housekeeping they tell I that they do not have any spare underlay !<ssssss>so we have three very uncomfortable night !<ssssss>on a positive note , the room be very quiet.breakfast in the hotel be very expensive ... $ 30 per person ... not much of a selection and the scramble egg be overcooked cold as be the bacon .<ssssss>better to go to the cafe next door to the hotel for a full breakfast for $ 11.90 .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 4 3 -1 -1		its a good location , but 1 or 2 issue first off , we get a great rate on this one via pricline $ 59 , so anything in this review have to be temper with that.i want this hotel as we be only stay in sf for 2 night , basically break we journey from dublin to hawaii.so locationwise this be great , literally 2 minute walk take you to the fisherman wharf area , another 7-8 min to pier 39 .<ssssss>the separate building feel like you be be assign 2nd class option , its a 2 min walk from the main reception , with luggage and after a 11hr flight , you really just want to get check in and get a elevator to you room .<ssssss>help be offer to walk to the other building , but we just do it the ol' fashion way.room be a great size , not too noise , and have 2 double beds.night before we leave i pre-booked a car to the airport at the main reception , as i recall it be $ 50 , which be not much more expensive than a shuttle for 2 people .<ssssss>driver be duely wait for we at we building reception -lrb- which be another reason for book car , save have to go back to the main building to get the shuttle -rrb- , and the car be excellent as be the driver.overall a great location , clean accomodation , but not be in the main building give a feeling of not qutie have get what you think you be get .<ssssss>
3 3 4 3 5 2 4 3		all style , less substance i have a few issue here .<ssssss>yes , the hotel be beautiful to look at , and the cleanest i have ever stay in .<ssssss>the bathroom be stunning , and the molton brown smelly be heavenly .<ssssss>however , it could have do with a few more hotel-like touches.more seat in the lobby would have be good , especially when wait for we room to be ready .<ssssss>be a kettle in the room not fashionable these day ?<ssssss>be there any need for the lift to be soooooo dark , that when open the door into we very white room , i be temporarily blinded.an average hotel experience for the money .<ssssss>
4 5 4 2 5 4 4 -1		very nice marriott , good service , location just okay i be very impressed by this marriott .<ssssss>the room be newly renovate and the hotel be very nice .<ssssss>there be a starbuck and roy 's in the lobby .<ssssss>the service be very accommodate and there be a nice workout facility -lrb- with a indoor pool -rrb- .<ssssss>my only real complaint be the location .<ssssss>with all the construction at the wtc site , it be difficult to get around .<ssssss>if you have business in the financial district , this be a perfect location .<ssssss>if you be in nyc as a visitor to see the site , it be a little cumbersome .<ssssss>all in all , i be very happy with the hotel -- it be probably the nicest marriott that i have stay at .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 3 5 4 -1		a mixed bag at halekulanus we recently have the pleasure in visit the absolutely delightful island of oahu .<ssssss>we usually stay at the sheraton moana surfrider but decide to include a short 2-night stay at the halekulanus .<ssssss>the decidedly mixed review on tripadvisor intrigue I and i know that i would probably either love it or hate it .<ssssss>as it turn out , my feeling fall somewhere in between .<ssssss>to give you some background , i be a 29year old aussie who visit the hotel with my sister.we book a diamond head deluxe view room through the lead hotel of the world .<ssssss>we pay $ usd600 per night -lrb- inclusive of tax -rrb- .<ssssss>the lobby be quite basic , fitting in with a relax resort theme .<ssssss>check in be friendly efficient .<ssssss>the grounds be just lovely and there be plenty of area to just sit , relax and enjoy the atmosphere.room : the room be of a standard size and be definitely very average for the price we pay .<ssssss>but after read review on tripadvisor i know what to expect .<ssssss>very subtle , pale colour use .<ssssss>there be no doubt in my mind that the main room area need to be update .<ssssss>the room be too bland and definitely need a splash of colour .<ssssss>secondly , the bed be terrible .<ssssss>very hard and be not conducive to a good night sleep .<ssssss>now to the good part .<ssssss>the bathroom be fantastic , very large , beautiful deep tub , design perfectly and in total contrast to the main room .<ssssss>finally , the most divine view in waikiki , diamond head .<ssssss>i definitely recommend spend more and get a diamond head view .<ssssss>the balcony be of a good size and definitely spacious enough to enjoy a meal outside .<ssssss>now the negative point : the balcony decor be cheap and tacky , very basic and secondly we balcony view be impede by about 60cm cement wall before the view actually start -lrb- we notice most floor have a total view -rrb- this be disappointing because when sit in bed you could not enjoy all the view .<ssssss>staff/servicethe halekulanus be renown for its personalised service and we definitely receive some amazing service but we also receive some positively dreadful service .<ssssss>we run into we check in agent several time during we stay and he always greet we by name .<ssssss>we be very impressed and in all the hotel that i have ever stay at this have never happen .<ssssss>when we arrive in we room we be tell that we would receive a welcome gift and after 2 hour of it not arrive we contact reception who apologise and say they would send it right up after another 1 hour wait i call again and finally it arrive .<ssssss>i also have a issue with a bathrobe , which i go to use and have a large bloodstain on it , absolutely disgusting , a new bathrobe be promptly delivered.finally , we have to check out the pool , we take some seat away from the sun a few row back from the pool .<ssssss>we wait 30 minute and no one come to offer we a towel or offer we a menu .<ssssss>i see many other people wait less than a 5 seconds for a attendant and i start get annoyed .<ssssss>i go to the lovely restaurant house without a key to get some service and i order my drink .<ssssss>5 minute later the pool attendant come over with the drink and with no apology .<ssssss>we ask why we receive no service and he honestly say that he do not believe that we be guest .<ssssss>now i know that we be not you usual halekulanus guest as the hotel host mainly japanese honeymooner but it be really unprofessional.food / restaurantswe have breakfast include in we package every morning at house without a key .<ssssss>there be not a huge selection and the pastry be truly terrible , however we be more than happy with it , there be something for everyone .<ssssss>the service be always fantastic and again my name be remembered every time i go into the restaurant .<ssssss>i be also impressed that all tax tip be include in we breakfast package.we also have the most wonderful lunch at house without a key , a beautiful seafood pasta that be divine , the quality be just fantastic .<ssssss>while we sit at this restaurant we really feel that we be mile away from waikiki bustle .<ssssss>just brilliant.we also have a wonderful afternoon tea , which i highly recommend , the quality of the food be fantastic , the service very personalised and it be just lovely.spaas part of we package i receive a free massage .<ssssss>again i be impressed that all cost include tax and tip be cover .<ssssss>the spa be lovely although certainly do not compare to the spa in asia .<ssssss>the service be great and the treatment be nothing like i have ever receive .<ssssss>they really try to create something altogether different .<ssssss>i be most happy and the final touch be great .<ssssss>you get to sit out in a the spa courtyard with a ice tea and frozen fruit skewer for as long as you like , a perfect end to a great treatment .<ssssss>overviewoverall there be element to the halekulanus that be unique and fantastic and then other part that be really disappointing .<ssssss>i also come to my own conclusion that there maybe be a reason why some people love the halekulanus and other hate it .<ssssss>if you have never be to a 5 star asian resort , with they low rate , deluxe room and fitting , divine food , endless buffet then the halekulanus will probably blow you away .<ssssss>but if you have , then you will know that there be better out there at far more value for money .<ssssss>in say that i do believe that the halekulanus be unique to the waikiki area as be definitely the best hotel if you be on you honeymoon or want a very quiet holiday .<ssssss>would i go back , i do not think so , although i be happy that i go .<ssssss>go for 2 or 3 night and judge for yourself .<ssssss>i would definitely only recommend go if you can get yourself a package deal .<ssssss>we pay $ usd600 per night that include daily breakfast for two , a afternoon tea for 2 , a lunch for 2 and a free massage for 1 and a late checkout to 4pm .<ssssss>with all these addition i end the stay satisfy that i get good value for money .<ssssss>now if i do not receive any additional benefit i would definitely have feel short-changed .<ssssss>anyway i hope that this help and enjoy you holiday!ann<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 5 5 2		a + rating for the executive my two friend and i stay at this hotel for two night in october of 2007 .<ssssss>it be a exceptionally wonderful stay .<ssssss>the staff be very helpful and speak very good english .<ssssss>they give excellent direction and advice as to restaurant and where to change money .<ssssss>the room be spacious - we have a triple .<ssssss>the room and bathroom be very clean .<ssssss>breakfast be ample .<ssssss>only drawback : we never do get the safe in the room to lock and the shower be so modern that we could not figure out how to turn it on and have to ask for assistance -lrb- we be jetlagged :-rrb- -rrb- i especially like the location of the hotel because it be very easy to find we way back -- follow the river .<ssssss>we walk everywhere from here - florence be best manuever by foot as the street be extremely narrow and the people drive like mad .<ssssss>the hotel be fairly spendy but you can get a decent deal on florenceby.com if you book far enough in advance .<ssssss>we return to florence two week later after travel around tuscany and even though we be not current guest , they assist we in book advance ticket to see the david at the accademia of art and also hail we a cab .<ssssss>i would definitely recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
2 3 3 1 3 4 4 -1		scary scary neighborhood !<ssssss>all in all the room be okay and the staff be very helpful and friendly .<ssssss>however , i be a woman travel alone and have the inconvenience of have a male friend walk I to the hotel every night from the bart station which be over 3 block away .<ssssss>also ... the free breakfast be horrible and they make you feel like you have to leave a tip !<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 4 2 3 5		nice enough for sf .<ssssss>we need a place for the whole family for graduation .<ssssss>since live in sf for 3 year , we know how difficult it would be to place the whole family and make sure there be thing to do in a relatively safe neighborhood .<ssssss>we pick the presidio area because there be the exploratorium and golden gate bridge for the kid , chestnut street for food , and the hotel have free parking .<ssssss>the price be decent for sf ~ $ 100/nt .<ssssss>i book 2 room off they website and 2 directly through the staff .<ssssss>be cautious because if you book thru the website , you can not claim the aaa discount since they be sell thru a 3rd party .<ssssss>the first room we get be in the process of a remodel and smell like heavy paint .<ssssss>they tell we they be not go to give we that room over the phone in the be but stick we with that room anyway ... the bathroom be semi-moldy and not do yet .<ssssss>after the first night , we ask and finally get a complete remodeled room which be very nice and comfortable .<ssssss>-lrb- 2nd floor middle corner room -rrb- .<ssssss>they have free parking , but only a limited number of space so you have to stake you claim early .<ssssss>breakfast be nothing special , cold cereal , oj , coffee , cocoa , danish .<ssssss>at least it be free .<ssssss>i think the area be safe since it be off the lombard main drag , but apparently , the hotel be hold up the second night we be there .<ssssss>otherwise , it be very quiet , and comfortable -lrb- if you get the right room -rrb- , but the staff need to communicate better .<ssssss>a major plus ... free wireless internet !<ssssss>
1 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		dissappointed , not gear to business visitor and room very basic and drab , have stay at the shibuya excell on a number of occasion i have express each time my disapointment that basic need particularly for the visit business man be simply not available.when the front desk be approach to provide assistance they tend to adopt a no can do attitued.i have visit this hotel a number of time since draw these anomoly to thier attention but see no effort to make improvement , they be most certainly not international in thier service although the staff be polite and well groom the end result always remain the same ... no can do !!!<ssssss>this last visit will be my last as i have give up on any expectation of improvement , my business associate in tokyo be naturally disappoint to learn of my frustration and have confirm similer complaint by other guest they have recommend to the hotel.they will no longer recommend visitor on business to check into this hotel and i have visit it for the last time .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 4 3 2		just fine for we .<ssssss>great stay .<ssssss>this hotel be great for the price .<ssssss>i be pleasantly surprise after read some of the other review on this site .<ssssss>we book a package deal with flight through a tour provider , so i donât know what the rate be .<ssssss>iâm guess they be about $ 100 a night for 6 night in mid-february .<ssssss>we be primarily there for the police concert -lrb- which rock btw -rrb- so the hotel didnât concern we much .<ssssss>itâs not like we be on we honeymoon , and we donât typically stay at plush place anyway .<ssssss>as long as the hotel be safe , clean and quiet , we be ok .<ssssss>the waikiki resort hotel be all three .<ssssss>prior to arrive , iâd email the hotelâs customer service department and ask for a room away from the elevator because i always end up near the elevator .<ssssss>when we get there , the room they initially assign to we be on the 9th floor directly across from the elevator .<ssssss>as soon as we get in the room , i call the front desk and explain my earlier request .<ssssss>they move we to another room right away .<ssssss>they even let I look at it first -lrb- with a security guard -rrb- .<ssssss>in fact , adam at the front desk be very helpful .<ssssss>we take the second room on the 18th floor .<ssssss>it be penthouse e. but before you get excite , the penthouse be the same as other room .<ssssss>nothing different .<ssssss>we have two full bed and a fridge .<ssssss>the room be clean , as be the whole hotel .<ssssss>the ac hadnât be turn on and be lock , so i call adam again .<ssssss>he say heâd send a maintenance man asap .<ssssss>when the maintenance man didnât arrive after about 25 minute , i call adam again and he apologize profusely and the maintenance man be at we door in 5 minute .<ssssss>later in we stay , the ac get lock again in the on position -lrb- a little too cold -rrb- and we call again .<ssssss>a maintenance man be there right away to adjust it .<ssssss>this time , my husband watch how he unlock the thermostat in case we need to do it again .<ssssss>the view from the room be the neighborhood and hill behind the hotel .<ssssss>since we didnât spend a lot of time in the room that be fine .<ssssss>at night , the view be very cool .<ssssss>the light from the house on the hill curve and remind we of lava flow down the hill .<ssssss>very cool.speed of the elevator be fine.the shower be tiny .<ssssss>i have to figure out a way to shave my leg w/o get water on the floor .<ssssss>my husband be very tall and the showerhead height be ok for he .<ssssss>but if you be a heavy person , the shower stall will definitely be too small for you .<ssssss>we leave we maid $ 2 each day and we request for more towel on the first day be fill and we never have to ask again .<ssssss>we didnât request clean sheet every day -lrb- in fact we tell the maid to leave they -rrb- .<ssssss>we donât change the sheet every day at home , why would i waste laundry water somewhere else ?<ssssss>we get lotion , shampoo and soap .<ssssss>the vent in the toilet/shower stall area be filthy inside , but since you donât spend a lot of time in there , who cares?the good : price , cleanliness and quiet .<ssssss>this be a small hotel compare to most in waikiki or honolulu .<ssssss>itâs really not a resort , though thatâs in the title .<ssssss>and i be fine with that .<ssssss>several friend stay at the hawaiian hilton village -lrb- hhv -rrb- .<ssssss>wow .<ssssss>thatâs a huge resort .<ssssss>it keep go and go .<ssssss>everything be sooooo expensive -lrb- food , drink -rrb- and it be very , very , very busy .<ssssss>there be always a long line to check in .<ssssss>the hhv have a lot of bar , restaurant and shop , but it be too bustling for my taste .<ssssss>we be ok with the lay back atmosphere at waikiki resort hotel -lrb- wrh -rrb- location : less than a block to the beach in front , less than a block to the bus stop on the street behind the hotel .<ssssss>a mcdonaldâs and burger king w/in a minuteâs walk and starbuck and subway w/in a 4 minute walk .<ssssss>there be three abc store w/in a 2 minute walk , two in front of the hotel and one behind .<ssssss>the beach be a 60 second walk .<ssssss>itâs pretty busy in that area , but walk a few minute toward diamond head and the park and the beach be less packed .<ssssss>ritzy shopping be just a few block away as be the zoo and aquarium.my husband rent a longboard and the bell hop store it for $ 5 a day , which be very convenient .<ssssss>the local surfer be helpful to he too , which heâd hear be not always the case .<ssssss>but surf be fine.refrigerator â?buy beer and water at abc , save $ $ $ $ $ .<ssssss>the staff be pleasant/helpful each time we speak with they .<ssssss>ask for the bus map.the bad : the business center didnât have a printer so i couldnât print we board pass to fly home .<ssssss>that seem stupid .<ssssss>the hotel should get a printer and charge people 5 cent for a sheet of paper if they be worry about waste .<ssssss>the business center be $ 7/hr .<ssssss>i hear -lrb- but do not confirm -rrb- that the hhv be $ 7.50 for 15 minutes!shower size â?already discussedpool â?it be nothing to write home about .<ssssss>very sparse area .<ssssss>if you want a fabulous poolside experience , you need to go to someplace like the hhv -lrb- though hhv be very strict about what can go in the pool â?no beach ball , no kid floaty , etc. -rrb- the room door be heavy and noisy .<ssssss>even if you try to shut they quietly , they bang .<ssssss>this be the only noise we hear from we neighbor except when they talk in the hall .<ssssss>we could not hear they in the next room.notes : the city bus to the pearl harbor/arizona memorial take a hour to get there and 80 minute to get back .<ssssss>cheap and easy , but if you donât have the time to spare , take a shuttle -lrb- not a cab ! -rrb-<ssssss>the bus be very easy to use but we do find that there be fewer route on the weekend and evening so we have to take cab a few time to get to place on time.do not try to walk to the diamond head visitorâs center .<ssssss>itâs too far combine with the hike to the top -lrb- which be totally worth it -rrb- .<ssssss>take the bus there.we find a great hole in the wall for breakfast .<ssssss>leave the hotel and go to the street behind it where the bus stop be .<ssssss>turn leave at the abc store on the corner .<ssssss>walk straight until you see a tiny little park -lrb- like a triangle -rrb- with a statue of a woman and a goose -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>in the middle .<ssssss>there be a restaurant call hula girl -lrb- not to be confuse with the expensive hula grill at one of the beach hotel -rrb- on the side street on the side of the park closest to diamond head and wrh .<ssssss>if the waitress call you âpretty ladyâ?or âhandsome man , â?youâre in the right place .<ssssss>the waitress alone be worth the 5 minute walk !<ssssss>the food be very reasonably price compare to other places.if you like the tv show lose , take the lose tour through big kahuna tour .<ssssss>tom be great!we have great weather - yay !!!!<ssssss>
5 3 5 4 5 3 5 3		great hotel we spend two night at this hotel at the beginning of november .<ssssss>we reserve a harvour view room and be not disappointed-the view be spectacular .<ssssss>we have breakfast in the room on both of the morning we be there , overlook the harbour.the location be great and from the airport there be a free shuttle bus which take you directly to the hotel .<ssssss>there be ample of shop near the hotel and the cab be so cheap you can go to other shopping area for a couple of quid.staff be attentive and helpful .<ssssss>there be a roof top pool which in itself be worth stay at the hotel for , you can see the whole city from up there .<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		certainly a bit surreal i be not too picky , and be usually comfortable in 2-star , but oh la la !<ssssss>aside from the vague sinking feeling we get upon open the door to we home for the next 3 day , there be a few very specific problem : 1 .<ssssss>the door to we room would lock , but be warped in such a way that the bottom of the door would not contact the wall , so there be almost a inch-wide slit of hallway light come in we room .<ssssss>2 .<ssssss>the mattress be squeeky-springed and uncomfortable .3 .<ssssss>the florescent lighting could not be harsher , and it flash on over several long seconds of flicker .4 .<ssssss>the toilet in the shared bathroom be rarely flush , a plumbing problem because one have to consciously pull the cord and hold for a good long time in order to flush properly , but it should not be the guest 's problem to figure this out .<ssssss>at the very least there should be a sign .<ssssss>5 .<ssssss>when i be pack up my stuff , i take out my towel from the drawer and scream when a huge cockroach come out with it .<ssssss>hello gregor samsa!on the upside it be in a good location and the staff be friendly enough .<ssssss>yes , it be one of the more reasonably price place , but someone be make a mint lure tourist to this dive .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 5 3 5		very small room , poor breakfast but location be great for shopping i book a stopover with cathay in this hotel .<ssssss>if you be outside for shop this hotel be very good , if you need to do some work in the room : do not book this hotel .<ssssss>i stay alone but with two people it must be awful.causeway bay be about 5-10 minute by walk away , everything be nearby , a park to relax , good restaurant and so on ...<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 5 3 5 -1		great free snorkle for the price we pay the resort be adequate the food average te staff be excellent .<ssssss>the thing we do not like be that the water front area be all close at 6:30 pm force everybody to go to only one bar at the lobby , it just place too many people in the same spot at the same time .<ssssss>if you go there you will need to walk a lot ... hello denis and marcie sorry we miss you on we last day , we do not find you around the pool , you company be fun.jean and yve dubois , laval , quebec<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 4 3 3 3		great view and location stay in a 2 bedroom/2 bath room overlook the harbour .<ssssss>the view from the room be amazing - you could take in the harbour bridge , circular quay , rock area and opera house.saw firework over harbour one night from room.room be really clean , with nice furniture , a good size kitchen and a small laundry room with washer/dryer .<ssssss>very quiet on upper floors.great location for get around and see the sight .<ssssss>restaurant in the area be kind of pricey - better to go out towards chinatown or other neighborhood where the local live .<ssssss>
1 2 4 4 4 3 1 3		be alrert !<ssssss>unbelievable poor customer handle !<ssssss>once in a life time happen to I ... in the 5-star hotel ... true story happen on may 22 , 2007 : i be back to the hotel room and find that my glass be break .<ssssss>obviously , i do not break it so it must be someone fromt the hotel break it by mistake .<ssssss>i take the broken glass to the reception and try to find out what be happen .<ssssss>it be very disappointing that they keep I wait for like 2 hr and the final answer be that no one be find responsible for this incident .<ssssss>in this case , i be absolutely innocent and helpless .<ssssss>because to I , a serious short-sighted person , i be totally blind without the glass .<ssssss>i feel extremely uncomfortable and be really torture experience.would you choose one hotel treat customer like this ?<ssssss>i be absolutely indoubt .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 5 4 5 -1		overall a good vacation stay these review be helpful.i find the hotel room to not be up to a 4.5 star level .<ssssss>however the rest of the hotel be nice ... there be a large selection of place to eat and the food itself be good .<ssssss>my child have no issue with the food either .<ssssss>the beach be great and the pool be also well kept.i only find the hotel lack inform the guest of entertainment through out the week .<ssssss>the staff that work at the hotel be great and helpful .<ssssss>tip be not require but it go a long way.the animation crew at the hotel lack content .<ssssss>they be silly and only stay with a few guest .<ssssss>they do not advise everyone of the event for the day.the maid serve be great , just ask and you will receive .<ssssss>spanish be they language so for those that be travel to this country i suggest you brush up or learn basic spanish.the employee be very accommodate and will try to serve you to the best of they ability .<ssssss>
3 3 2 3 3 5 4 -1		style over comfort .<ssssss>staircase up to room<ssssss>
3 2 3 4 2 3 4 -1		questionable quality this property be wonderful in some way , but ... we have to request maintenance to clean a filthy a/c heat vent ; we find every service require a fee -- parking : $ 18 / $ 24 ; pet fee $ 50 ; internet access : $ 5/day .<ssssss>the interior courtyard be pleasant , even on a cold winter day , but pet litter be leave unattended to .<ssssss>why be there a $ 50 pet fee if it be not for some clean up ?<ssssss>in the room itself , wallpaper be peel off the wall in the bathroom !<ssssss>not the hilton quality we be use to .<ssssss>
2 2 3 -1 4 -1 2 -1		not for everyone what a disappointment !<ssssss>the room be average and clean , but not what we expect from stay at other hyatt .<ssssss>the biggest disappoinment be all the extra charge and the staff .<ssssss>i know parking in s.f. be at a premium , but $ 39 plus tax for valet be a bit steep .<ssssss>the valet staff inform we we could park in the parking garage across the street for $ 28 , but you have to pay everytime you leave and return .<ssssss>we decide to do this the first night , but find out the next morning it only cost $ 10 dollar .<ssssss>it do vary accord to how long you be park , but we never pay more than $ 18 for the day and leave a couple of time .<ssssss>we find this to be misleading info from the valet staff .<ssssss>the only issue be that it can be a little confusing to get to , even though you can see it from the front of the hotel .<ssssss>next , when we check in , the woman at the check-in desk never say hello , welcome , or thank you !<ssssss>when we ask to be put on the highest floor available , she loudly announce that we have book at a discounted rate and we could not go past the 12th floor .<ssssss>we be not ask for the penthouse !<ssssss>this make we feel unwelcomed , because we do not pay full price .<ssssss>as for room amenity , they do provide a coffee maker , but you have to pay for the generic coffee !<ssssss>i have stay a several upscale hotel and never have to pay .<ssssss>you best bet be to go to starbuck across the street .<ssssss>this hotel maybe good for business traveler , because of the convenient location .<ssssss>however , if you be on a budget or prefer to spend you money on fun thing -lrb- like we ! -rrb-<ssssss>you might want to stay elsewhere .<ssssss>
1 1 2 -1 1 -1 3 -1		yecch !<ssssss>hotel la playa have a seedy feel to it from we first moment .<ssssss>when we first walk into we room , the smell of cigarette smoke be overwhelming .<ssssss>we be surprise when , a moment after comment on that , the maid emerge from the bathroom with a cigarette dangle from she lip!the bed be uncomfortable and the sheet be itchy .<ssssss>the bathroom be sketchy enough to warrant wear flip-flop in the shower .<ssssss>the drink from the bar taste like rub alcohol even though i specifically order 2nd shelf liquor .<ssssss>overall , the place be just a dive.like other traveler , we be on a tight budget .<ssssss>we last night in san juan we stay at a gorgeous guest house -lrb- andalucia -rrb- in ocean park .<ssssss>it be the exact same price and world apart .<ssssss>trust I , you do not need to punish yourself with a stay at hotel la playa just to save money !<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 2 2 4 5		would never go back .<ssssss>hotel from the air<ssssss>
4 2 5 5 5 4 4 5		love the hotel du cadran my experience at the hotel du cadran be everything i hope and want it to be .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful , and the room be trendy and comfortable .<ssssss>i would love to stay there again .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 4 4 4		not worth the price or it be star rating every time i book at four point , i assume it will be better than it end up be .<ssssss>i know that starwood have be try to upgrade this brand to bring it more in line with its other brand , but it still fall short .<ssssss>this hotel in particular , while a great location in sydney -lrb- especially for tourist visit the darling harbour area -rrb- just be not up to par give the price tag .<ssssss>i have a harbour view room on the spg floor -lrb- the view be good -rrb- , but the room be incredibly damp , even allow for the fact that we be three block from the water .<ssssss>the cieling be quite low , make the bathroom dark since it only have one light .<ssssss>it be rather ironic , in that i read the starwood brochure provide in the room , and it say one thing that four point have be a good shower - and this shower be not very good .<ssssss>even the furniture in the room need update .<ssssss>the price for all service - room service , in-room telephone , and internet , to name a few - be all more expensive than the westin melbourne where i have stay previously.after i arrive and get settle in , i check out rate for the 5-star sheraton on the park across town .<ssssss>for the subsequent night i have in sydney , the sheraton be the same price - so i check out early the next day -lrb- the front desk be very accomodating , so a thank you to they -rrb- and transferred.it 's not that the hotel overall be bad - probably 3 star overall , and definitely suitable for tourist group - but give the higher perception that the hotel give on its web site and the newer , more upscale look sheraton be try to put on this brand , i can not give it more than the 2 star .<ssssss>
1 1 5 2 5 3 1 2		terrible service and way too expensive if youâre look to spend a night in boston i do not recommend the hyatt at the airport .<ssssss>the hotel itself be very nice , with a paint ceiling over the front desk and very modern style room ; however itâs not the room that make the hotel itâs the service and the prices/location .<ssssss>on the bus ride to the hotel from the airport i ask the bus driver where the nearest liqueur store be -lrb- sorry but iâm not pay $ 8 for a cheap beer -rrb- , for some reason he look at I like i be some kind of scum bag alcoholic .<ssssss>he reply in a nasty voice i do not live around here i wouldnt know , and you cant bring alcohol into the hotel !<ssssss>do that answer you question ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>i also catch attitude from the freakin ' bell boy that night .<ssssss>after all that i be walk around with my fist in the air .<ssssss>i couldnât believe it , i mean super 8 would treat I better -lrb- it would be a hell of alot cheaper too -rrb- .<ssssss>so for some reason you do not take my advice and stay there , just hear this warning , eat at the airport before you go to the hotel because there be nothing around it , and a $ 14 sandwich at the hotel fit in the palm of you hand , do not get thirsty cause beer start at 7 buck .<ssssss>
3 2 2 4 4 3 3 -1		perfect location for a tourist i just return from a week long stay at the hyatt fisherman 's wharf .<ssssss>first and foremost , it be a great location , but a bit on the steep side for the amenity .<ssssss>i choose not to spend the $ 10 a day usage for the internet .<ssssss>on the upside , it be literally two block sfrom the wharf and a short walk from ghiradellus square to pier 39 , the main shopping/tourist spot .<ssssss>the cable car stop be behind the hotel .<ssssss>i be travel with my elderly mother and my two son and share a room be not a issue in term of space .<ssssss>the room be comfortable , bedding be fluffy , but if you be look for a firm bed , that be not what you will get .<ssssss>surprisingly , there be no mini bar -lrb- or fridge -rrb- in the room , and there be no fan in the bathroom either the rate we get via aaa be better than the internet rate , plus aaa rate get we free buffet full breakfast each morning -lrb- egg , fresh fruit , bacon/sausage , banana bread , etc -rrb- , which be a huge savings .<ssssss>we choose the hotel for they outdoor hotel , but who know that sf weather in late july would be so cool -lrb- it be like maine weather so a bit cool for the pool when we stay here -rrb- .<ssssss>downside be they only have one concierge on duty at a time , so the wait to get any information about tour or map can take forever , and if the younger of the two be on duty , i would not even bother ask he restaurant recommendation or suggest tour or route .<ssssss>he be not very helpful and do not seem to enjoy he role as concierge .<ssssss>the older gentleman be wonderful and extremely helpful and informative .<ssssss>the radisson and holiday inn be close by as well , and be less expensive , if you do not want to spend the $ 270 a night at the hyatt.tip : best place for dim sum be new asia on pacific street in chinatown , it be authentic and delicious .<ssssss>all the local chinese eat there .<ssssss>.<ssssss>-lrb- yang sink be the one the concierge and everyone seem to recommend , but it be in a corporate office building , and it be really tailor to non-chinese tourist , and although a nicer setter and delcious food , be very expensive for dim sum -rrb- .<ssssss>we have the same dish at new asia for less than half the price of yang sink ... and it be better !<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		very nice room we stay at the grand hotel baglionus last month on we trip to italy for we anniversary .<ssssss>the hotel be part of a package we get through costco for part of we vacation .<ssssss>we love it .<ssssss>the room be large and the bathroom be large and very nice .<ssssss>the furnishings be beautiful and comfortable .<ssssss>the front desk be very helpful and provide a very nice bottle of wine for we for we anniversary .<ssssss>they do not have breakfast like we do here in the state but we think it be very good , especially the fresh fruit and capuccino .<ssssss>it be also in a good location , just a short walk from the train station .<ssssss>it be only a 10-15 minute walk to most of the museum and sight .<ssssss>
2 1 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		beautiful hotel but very disappointed ... i just return from a five day stay from the paradisus , and both I and my fiancee be extremely disappointed .<ssssss>i will say the hotel be beautiful .<ssssss>the room be great , bathroom be great , pool be gorgeous , and the bally bed be amazing .<ssssss>sadly that be where my positive review end .<ssssss>.<ssssss>now onto my real problem with the resort :1 .<ssssss>food - one word , bad .<ssssss>my fiancee be sick in bed for half of the trip .<ssssss>i think the resort try to hard to be ` fancy . '<ssssss>nothing be simple .<ssssss>personally i do not want a seafood paella for lunch when its 88 degree and sunny .<ssssss>a simple sandwich with french fries be all we want , and there be not any simple option like that .<ssssss>we end up spend a ton of money on pringle at the gift shop .<ssssss>we be from nyc , and we be use to great food , but we have be on vacation many time where the food be decent and we be happy .<ssssss>this place be not the case .<ssssss>i can not even imagine what kid would eat at a place like this .2 .<ssssss>restaurant - the choice of restaurant be also a real problem .<ssssss>personally , when we go on vacation we go to relax and enjoy the sun , weather , and the beach .<ssssss>with the exception of the buffet , there be not a single restaurant that you could enjoy outdoors .<ssssss>everything be indoors with air conditioning , and require the man to wear closed-toed shoe , another problem .<ssssss>worst of all , there be not a single place to get a bite during the day while you be lay by the pool or on the beach .<ssssss>you have to get up from you lounge area and walk all the way down to the restaurant to eat .<ssssss>how they could not even have a grill near the pool be beyond I - i have never see anything like that .<ssssss>it do not allow for any sort of relaxation , it be way too formal , but yet not even good !<ssssss>3 .<ssssss>service - we get royal service , aka : no service .<ssssss>it be a waste of money .<ssssss>the pool be lovely , but so be the other pool .<ssssss>maybe if this resort be actually half-way full , r would be worth it .<ssssss>but when we be there , it be half empty and the only crowded place be the r spot .<ssssss>the rest of the resort be empty , to the point of depressing!maybe this place be just too new and have not figure it out yet , but what a waste of a week !<ssssss>
1 1 3 4 2 1 1 -1		nonexistent service this hotel should be call backpacker wentworth not travelodge.though the room themselves be adequate there be no sevice to be have for any price.the harass staff at reception be unable to offer any local knowledge or information to visitor .<ssssss>when ask to call a taxi we be advise to stand on the corner of the street and flag one down.we leave we room at 10 a.m. and leave a card to have it service .<ssssss>on we return at 4 p.m. we find it exactly as we leave it .<ssssss>it take two phone call to reception and 45 minute to have fresh towel and other supplies deliver and the service person who finally turn up tell we that it be hotel strategy not to make up occupied room until late afternoon and evening .<ssssss>
3 2 4 4 3 4 2 3		great building , inconsistent service this be the hotel that be feature on the opening credit of the tv show dalla for many year , and remain the epitome of the mirror glass architecture from the late 70s/early 80s in dallas .<ssssss>that , and the trademark atrium , date this hotel somewhat .<ssssss>still , they have do a nice job of update thing .<ssssss>room be airy and sizable -- and place the bed overlook the view -lrb- as oppose to parallel to the window -rrb- make the room feel bigger still .<ssssss>good bed , and enjoyable shower , with noteworthy water pressure .<ssssss>my room , 2321 , have a good view of the skyline , and many of the room on that side of the hotel do -- request one .<ssssss>the hotel be well located for highway access , particularly for a downtown hotel .<ssssss>valet parking be $ 19.50 a day , and can be slow for car retrieval .<ssssss>internet be $ 10 per day -- obscene give margin on this service , and outrageous give that many less expensive hotel no longer charge for this .<ssssss>fitness center be well maintain , and though some equipment could use update , it be nicely furnish and free to guest .<ssssss>there be a pool and hottub on 3 , but can not say it look very welcome ... overlook the back side -- a rather desolate view -- of the hotel.what be frustrate about the hotel be the service -- while always pleasant , it can be lack .<ssssss>housekeeping just make my bed and replace my towel one day -- no tidy up .<ssssss>another day , they neglect to come , altogether .<ssssss>in fairness , the hotel recoup well , and i get follow up from the housekeeping manager and the assistant room manager -- both of whom attempt to make amends .<ssssss>while recovery be good , there be sufficient lapse to disappoint .<ssssss>yes , get this room for $ 59 a night on priceline , but still expect good service from a 4 diamond hyatt regency ... with work , perhaps i would be impressed next time .<ssssss>building , overall , be a pleasant surprise -- and if service have be at the same level , this would be a great find , particularly at the priceline rate .<ssssss>would still return , but would caution those pay full price that you may or may not get 4 diamond caliber service during you stay .<ssssss>and note to hotel -- seek way to eliminate internet fee ... it feel as if you be nickel and diming you guest .<ssssss>bad .<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		beautiful , luxurious but ... .<ssssss>i stay at the halekulanus for 5 night in august .<ssssss>the hotel be beautiful and the service be amazing .<ssssss>the restaurant be fabulous as be the room service .<ssssss>room service breakfast even come with you own toaster !<ssssss>my one complaint be the lack of shade and sufficient umbrella at the pool .<ssssss>in order to get a chair with a umbrella , we literally have to be down at the pool by 6 am .<ssssss>this be not something i would expect to do on vacation .<ssssss>even when i tell the manager that i have have skin cancer and could not sit in the sun without a umbrella , nothing be do to accomodate I .<ssssss>with all the focus these day on how bad suntanning be for one 's health , you would think a hotel of this caliber would have be more understanding .<ssssss>

4 4 2 2 5 5 5 -1		very good , but not great we have just return from a trip to bali include four night at the karma jimbaran -lrb- see review -rrb- and three night at uma ubud .<ssssss>we stay here do not get off to a good start .<ssssss>we have book a car to pick we up from jimbaran , but the car do not arrive .<ssssss>i phone the uma and they send a car immediately , but due to the distance between the resort , we end up wait over two hour in total .<ssssss>we also have to switch room after the first night due to some plumbing problem , which be not such a big problem , but certainly not ideal .<ssssss>we receive a free late check-out at the end of we stay , which may have be intend as compensation , although no-one say this explicitly.as for the resort , the reception and pool area be beautiful , and the restaurant be set lower down in the valley with nice view and a lovely open-air feel .<ssssss>however , the resort be situate on a relatively small piece of land , and therefore the villa be packed tightly together with no sense of space .<ssssss>this be a huge contrast to the wondeful maya ubud , where we stay last year.we stay in a garden villa , which be not the cheapest category of room but probably the worst .<ssssss>the room itself be nice , if very simple , and the bathroom be beautiful , but the garden consist of a small sit area with a table and two upright chair , and a tiny lawn .<ssssss>both area be completely surround by 3-meter high wall - mean that you view be a small square of sky - and both be too small to fit lounger .<ssssss>the cheaper terrace room have beautiful view of the valley , so if a view be important to you , go for the cheaper option!we eat at the restaurant for breakfast every day , and for lunch and dinner on other occasion .<ssssss>the food be good , but nothing amazing .<ssssss>we also try mozaic , where the food be fantastic , but we find the whole experience to be exhaustingly fancy and formal - not the kind of thing we be look for in a holiday in bali.one of the great thing about the uma ubud be its location just step away from sanggingan road , where you can find lot of nice shop and gallery , a few restaurant -lrb- include mozaic -rrb- , and the fabulous bintang supermarket for beer , juice and snack ten time cheaper than the mini bar at the resort .<ssssss>we also have a superb lunch at the kafe batan waru in ubud town center - my beef rendang be the best meal of the whole trip .<ssssss>definitely worth a visit.another mention should go to the reception staff , who be incredibly helpful and polite.i have list quite a few negative here , but i still enjoy my stay at the uma ubud .<ssssss>nevertheless , i would probably go back to the maya ubud or splash out on the four season sayan if i go back to ubud for another visit .<ssssss>

3 2 3 5 3 3 2 -1		good location but ... .<ssssss>we stay 28th dec-30thdecthe hotel location be great , just across the street from central station.you can walk to anything easily , no need for taxis.the use of the spa at the hotel be at a extra charge , i feel this should have be include consider the amount they charge for the rooms.the lobby area look nice , we find the concierge staff very friendly and helpful , you can also leave you bag with they if you room isnât ready.the bar area look nice , however we do not visit it.we do have breakfast at the hotel , good choice , nice and fresh , plus serve until 11am on the weekend , so you still get to have a great lie in bed.the most disappointing part of the hotel be firstly the reception staff , we find they to be very unhelpful , uninterested in the guest , almost to the point of be rude.secondly the size of we room , we book a smoking room and the 1st floor , very small , the kind of room that when you walk into it you practically fall on the bed , although it be clean and reasonably well furnished nothing special but fortunately when stay a city you donât spend much time in you room.bathroom adequate , small but shower be fine.we arrange a late check out which cost 35 euro for 2 hour , expensive but nice if you want to relax before trip home .<ssssss>overall , the location be the best thing about this hotel , it be by no mean a 4 star hotel and not 4 star service but if you can get a good room rate and donât expect too much itâs not a bad choice .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 5 -1 4 -1		nice hotel but def not a 4 star just get back from barcelona today after stay for 6 night in the husa barcelona mar.it be a nice modern hotel but to be honest i would give it 3 star and not 4 .<ssssss>room be nice but the air conditioning be crap for such a new hotel.we have very little air come out of it and certainly be not cool.complained on second day and be tell it be down all over the hotel and would be fix next day.sure enough return to we room the next day and it be fix but to be honest u have to stand right under it to feel to cool air which wasnt much even at high level.as a result the room could be warm and difficult to sleep in.also ask reception for a iron so i could iron my clothes to be tell they dont provide one and the only option be get they press at a charge per item.first hotel i have ever stay in around the world that could provide you with a iron.so be warn .<ssssss>-lrb- so much for 4 star -rrb- but other than that the room be modern and clean and metro be a short stroll and didnt find the area rough at all as other mentioned.beach be close and you have a pool on roof .<ssssss>-lrb- small pool , not very deep though . -rrb-<ssssss>enjoy my stay but my main gripe be the air conditioning .<ssssss>the other thing i could live with.will return to barcelona but think i will stay elsewhere .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 5 4 3 1		a lovely gem after a 30 hour flight i have to confess to a tiny bit of initital disappointment with the regent .<ssssss>i have read that you should request a room with a view over the gendarmenmarkt .<ssssss>i email and phone the hotel to request such a room , but when i arrive i be tell my room be not in the right price bracket to have such a view .<ssssss>it would have be helpful if someone have reply to my email to let I know this , rather than disappoint I at check in .<ssssss>the room i be give be pleasant - it have at least a partial view of the gendarmenmarkt , but it be a bit tired - 1980s sage green carpet , pale apricot wall and gold tap in the bathroom .<ssssss>-lrb- one other quibble which i will put now so as not to end on a negative note - outrageously expensive computer access - i wish hotel would learn that the what they reap in profit on this , they must lose in annoyed guest . -rrb-<ssssss>once i have a decent night sleep though i could begin to appreciate the regent 's other benefit and i forgive they for the decor .<ssssss>the regent be in a fabulous location - on a quiet side street in the old eastern bloc - perfectly located within walk distance of all the major sightseeing centre .<ssssss>i have worry that this part of town be a little remove from the heart of the city - the kurfurstendam - but after vist that side of town i feel that we have definitely make the right location decision .<ssssss>the regent be walk distance to the brnadenburg gate , to checkpoint charlie , to all the major gallery and museum .<ssssss>there be the gallery lafayette across the street and several beautiful high end boutique minute from the hotel .<ssssss>the service in the hotel be very impressive - complimentary shoe shine each night ; a book mark leave on a book we be read ; bowl of chocolate leave every day and a box of chocolate leave as a farewell gift .<ssssss>the doorman be particularly friendly and it be a pleasure to come back to the hotel at the end of each day .<ssssss>it be a relatively small hotel so the overall feel be one of calmness and tranquility .<ssssss>

check-in : be a cluster .<ssssss>we arrive and be happy to bump into one of the other couple we be meet in punta cana .<ssssss>it come out that they be not able to check in as they do not have a print voucher which end up be a copy of they email itinerary .<ssssss>they literally have to go over to guest service and log into email to get the print out and bring it back - hello , technology ?<ssssss>since when can not you check into a hotel with the credit card you use to make the reservation ?<ssssss>at most with a picture id ?<ssssss>there be a bunch of other people go through this check-in hell and the cold clothes and no liquor drink be not enough to make anyone happy .<ssssss>we be lucky to have this print out but when we check in they have no room available and it be 3:00 pm and we have be up since 3:00 am .<ssssss>we check-in attendant be less than helpful , would not listen , and we finally have to demand a room and be promptly place next to the construction -lrb- which we never hear so no big deal -rrb- .<ssssss>- room : the room be beautiful , spacious , and well keep .<ssssss>we be welcome with a bottle of champagne and a stock minus fridge which be nice .<ssssss>extra shower towel would have be fantastic but be deliver upon request .<ssssss>the in-room safe be great , especially consider i be nervous about leave important thing in the room .<ssssss>the shower be spacious and jacuzzi tub in the room be a nice touch .<ssssss>the bed be like lie on a tiled floor and the pillow be marginal but we make do.-customer service : you find some , you do not .<ssssss>we meet 2-4 really great people at the majestic .<ssssss>pablo and jose be excellent to we and remember we - many of the bartender be smile and fun , always take the time to talk to we and interact .<ssssss>the staff at the restaurant leave a lot to be desire .<ssssss>i have never see such poor attitude and bad customer service .<ssssss>the front desk staff , as indicate above , be subpar , with the exception of rafael who coordinate transportation for we via we blackberry the day of we arrival .<ssssss>maybe it be the culture , but it seem more often than not that we as guest be bother the staff .<ssssss>the spa lady be superb , however !<ssssss>- food : below average .<ssssss>i be shock at how the food be , especially after read so many positive review .<ssssss>maybe i come from a location where the food be way beyond average and have travel to other island with phenomenal food but this be probably the largest disappointment .<ssssss>after a day or so , we be able to navigate and remember what be good and what be bad and so it seemingly get better .<ssssss>the food at le gourmet be good , with french influence but not french cuisine .<ssssss>the food at the japanese place be good , but this be we most horrific experience of customer service so that be a bit shadowed .<ssssss>suggestion : get reservation immediately upon check-in for these two restaurant as we be not able to do the japanese hibatchus portion of the japanese restaurant .<ssssss>taino be a decent mexican/dominican buffet and the breakfast be pretty good -lrb- aside from the rubbery french toast and pancake -rrb- .<ssssss>i suggest lunch at the main buffet as the one on the beach rarely change and be not all that good .<ssssss>also , the buffet be even strict on attire , so it be somewhat frustrating to not be able to walk off the beach/pool and get lunch without change into clothes .<ssssss>also , there be no 24 hour access to food - this be disappointing as sometimes between meal you want a quick snack -lrb- especially when drinking -rrb- and it be not there.beach / pool : phenomenal .<ssssss>i have be all over and this beach be one of the best beach i have be to and it be the best pool i have ever be to .<ssssss>the ocean be like be in a wave pool - a ton of fun for boogie board !<ssssss>there be ample amount of chair and hut which be excellent .<ssssss>i suggest take advantage of the massage on the beach as it be so relaxing and beautiful !<ssssss>the pool be so clean and have lot of neat spot with jacuzzi , ledge to sit on , a swim-up bar , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>again , plenty of chair and huts.overall : pretty good .<ssssss>it be a shame that the check-in experience , poor customer service , and so-so food bring my experience expectation lower than before arrival because this resort be absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>the grounds be well keep , extremely tropical and pretty , clean and full of life .<ssssss>the michael jackson show be a blast and many of the bartender be charismatic and a lot of fun to be around .<ssssss>the room be pretty , the beach and pool some of the best i have see .<ssssss>i think the majestic can easily improve upon some of the thing i have list and it will truly attract return visitor .<ssssss>will i go back ?<ssssss>not unless someone get marry there -lrb- which they pump out multiple wedding a day - crazy ! -rrb-<ssssss>or the group decide to return .<ssssss>i think there be better place in the carribean and look forward to experience they - however the colonial be a great time , excellent experience and i encourage other to visit with the understanding of some of the shortcoming i have identify .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 3 3 2 3		ok resort , good stay my mom and i go to catalonia for a week , march 27 to april 4 , 2008 .<ssssss>this be we second time to punta cana , last year we travel to sirenis cocotal resort in punta cana .<ssssss>as much as we try not to , we end up compare the two resort and overall we like we experience at the sirenis better .<ssssss>flight , airport , hotel : fly air transat be definitely better than sky service .<ssssss>a week before we trip , we be notify that we flight be postpone for 2 hour for some reason .<ssssss>other than that , it be a pleasant flight .<ssssss>we get to the airport at around 11 pm , by the time you go through custom and pick up luggage , it be 12pm .<ssssss>drive to the hotel be 20 minute , the system be quite chaotic for checking-in , but we be provide with the snack and assign to we room .<ssssss>i would advise that you take you own luggage by yourself to the room .<ssssss>the road may be bumpy and quite lengthy depend on how far you be on the resort from the lobby , and there be also no elevator , however , if you take you luggage , you will unpack faster .<ssssss>we have to wait for a hour to get we luggage from bell boy who deliver all the luggage if you leave it in the lobby area .<ssssss>room : we have a problem with the room as we be assign a room on the first floor with one king size bed .<ssssss>by the time we take care of that , we end up go to bed at 2 pm .<ssssss>the next day we have to switch room at 3 pm so we lose some quality time on the beach .<ssssss>we get the room with 2 junior bed .<ssssss>the bed be too small ; we have double bed in sirenis .<ssssss>there be a nice balcony with a hammock ; however , we hammock -lrb- which i be really look forward to ! -rrb-<ssssss>be break .<ssssss>there be big bathtub and a very small shower in the washroom .<ssssss>we never use the bathtub , i would have prefer to have a bigger shower and no tub .<ssssss>be careful with the water come on the floor out of the shower .<ssssss>on the negative side , my mom say she see two cockroachesâlike bug in we washroom one night .<ssssss>i never see anyâ aybe because i never turn on the light !<ssssss>also , there be some small ant if you leave any food in the room so try not to do that .<ssssss>we be in villa 9 and we be not impress with we maid at all .<ssssss>never have a ashtray , ask but never get it .<ssssss>ask for a iron and nothing happen .<ssssss>if feel like bed sheet be never change , and overall we didnât feel welcome at all .<ssssss>the day we be leave , the maid start clean we room at 11 , while check out be 12 -lrb- and usually she would come in at around 3pm .<ssssss>! -rrb-<ssssss>we do leave tip , but didnât see the difference .<ssssss>at sirenis , we maid be very smiley and welcome and always leave flower on we bed .<ssssss>it probably depend on which villa you get in .<ssssss>also , be prepare that it be very dark in the room so you would not be able to read at night in the room.food : my mom didnât like the fool in comparison with the sirenis .<ssssss>you can always find what to eat but there be limit choice .<ssssss>we also didnât like the setting of the main restaurant .<ssssss>it be very dark in it in the evening and not welcome .<ssssss>we didnât like the restaurant system of wait until you get site .<ssssss>in the other resort , we could have stay whenever we want .<ssssss>service be not good , sometimes non-existent , one night , we have we all dinner with no one come to we and ask if we want any water , tea or wine .<ssssss>most of the time , we go to get we own tea and coffee .<ssssss>overall , we find the staff not very welcome , most of the time we feel like people didnât care .<ssssss>we never have a desire to tip , as we do at sirenis .<ssssss>overall , at sirenis , we find the whole atmosphere much better , waiter be always smile , singing and dancing , all staff on the resort be much more open , happy and welcome than in catalonia .<ssssss>most of the time , we have lunch and breakfast at the beach restaurant and it be ok .<ssssss>definitely try pizza at the pool bar -lrb- 12:30 â ?<ssssss>5:30 -rrb- â?itâs delicious , they also have burger , chicken , nacho there which be also good .<ssssss>beach : overall , i be disappoint with the ocean .<ssssss>as a good swimmer , i find limited opportunity to swim far and have fun , the ocean be very shallow , there be a lot of seaweed , which i never find like that at the sirenis -lrb- only one day after a storm ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>it be however beautiful to look at it -lrb- combination of different blue color be amazing ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i do some snorkeling and see some fish but it wasnât exciting .<ssssss>there be seaweed on the beach as well , but staff try to clean it every day , several time a day .<ssssss>it be nice and breezy on the beach , except for the last few day before the rain come and the weather be change , the wind get so strong , and we couldnât stay on the beach so we relocate to the swimming pool .<ssssss>donât know how people stay beside the beach , i feel like i fire myself in 15 minute .<ssssss>there be a lot of sunbed available but palapa be limit .<ssssss>most people reserve palapa at night , before leave the beach , they would leave they towel to save the spot for the next morning , which i think be not fair to other people , as whoever wake up first should have the spot .<ssssss>other : there be local shop on the right side of the resort , and one on the left .<ssssss>bargain , bargain and bargain again!we do parasailing and it be lot of fun !<ssssss>highly recommend if you havenât do that before .<ssssss>animation team be great !<ssssss>overall , we have a good time , as it be all about what you make out of you stay , however , we will not come back.best regard , happy traveler .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 5 3 4 -1		nice location while visit san juan my family of four recently stay at the coral princess inn which be conveniently located in condado .<ssssss>it be easy to catch a bus or cab to old san juan from this location .<ssssss>the beach be a short walk away and there be many restaurant to choose from .<ssssss>we room with one queen size bed be very small , especially when we add the roll away mattress .<ssssss>if i know how small the room be i would have reserve a different one .<ssssss>the room be clean however and we do not have problem with the hot water supply when we want it .<ssssss>the property be maintain nicely with many tropical plant .<ssssss>the area where breakfast be serve be very nice .<ssssss>they offer the standard continental food and drink .<ssssss>they also have a piano for the guest and a quiet reading room .<ssssss>the pool be very small but my kid still enjoy it very much .<ssssss>they also have a hot tub on the upper level but you need to walk through the penthouse suite to get to it .<ssssss>overall we experience be good while stay here and i would select it again if we return to san juan .<ssssss>

4 3 3 5 5 3 3 -1		a great place to visit my partner and i stay there for 3 night this past march .<ssssss>we be in the executive tower and i must say at first glance i be not blow away , but the place grow on I .<ssssss>before make the trip i be more than a little irk that we have to pay a extra $ 30.00 per night to have a double bed , and i still find this outrageous .<ssssss>have say that , we bed be more like a king size , and although the room be on the small side , as other have say , you there to change and sleep .<ssssss>each day we be give clean kimono and slipper .<ssssss>my personal favourite be the gadget , think japanese ingenuity .<ssssss>heated toilet seat , with a build in bidet -lrb- never use one before , but love it -rrb- and the heated mirror in the bathroom which stay clear no matter how hot the shower .<ssssss>oh yeah , another thing i love , the shower be amazing .<ssssss>so strong , great for revive after a day of touring .<ssssss>as other have say , the hotel complex be right across from shinagawa station , and once we figure out the train and metro system - not that complicated - we be away .<ssssss>most staff speak a little english , more than enough to get by .<ssssss>if you stay there go across the street to wing , a department store , and go down to the basement and prepare yourself for a epicurean carnival .<ssssss>lot of different counter that sell all sort of food ready to eat , and local buy before take the train home .<ssssss>it be worth it to splurge and go up to the top floor of the new tower to eat or have a drink .<ssssss>the view be really breathtaking , but beware , if you only have a drink in the bar there be a cover charge , roughly $ 5.00 u.s. per person that no one mention until you see it on the bill .<ssssss>you make take you breakfast that be include in the roomrate there if you like and still benefit from the view .<ssssss>we be not tea drinker in the morning -lrb- the hotel only supply teabag -rrb- but you can buy these coffee kit in the shop , 3 for about $ 5.00 .<ssssss>finally , let 's talk about the food court .<ssssss>personally , i find the selection a little limited , but i highly recommend the first counter to the leave as you enter .<ssssss>they specialize in ramen and it be amazing .<ssssss>what be interesting about this place be that you place you order by select what you like from a ticket machine .<ssssss>you make you selection , -lrb- lot of photo so do not worry about not speak japanese -rrb- pay you money into the machine , take you ticket to the counter and give it to the cook , and he in turn give you a pager .<ssssss>you find a table , and when you meal be ready the pager go off , and you go and collect it .<ssssss>all in all , this be a great place to stay .<ssssss>i not only recommend it , but will not hesitate to stay there again .<ssssss>
1 2 4 -1 2 -1 4 -1		never again first and foremost , a resort that require that you brush you tooth with bottled water can not rate 5 star .<ssssss>4 of the 8 of we have gastric nightmare during we stay .<ssssss>the food be mediocre at best and it can make you ill as we find out .<ssssss>we eat carefully and use antiseptic wipe whenever possible .<ssssss>we effort be not reward .<ssssss>this be not a vacation .<ssssss>this be like some weird version of a gastric survivor show .<ssssss>on the positive side , the dominican staff at the resort could not have be nicer .<ssssss>it be too bad that the sanitary condition undo they goodwill .<ssssss>
5 5 4 -1 3 -1 5 -1		great stay nice hotel !<ssssss>the staff be great .<ssssss>the response to call be quick and friendly .<ssssss>everyone be very helpful .<ssssss>this be we first trip back to new orlean since the hurricane , and do not know what to expect , but the staff at the lafayette more than deliver , and we get upgrade to a suite , just for lagniappe !<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 5 3 3 -1		high floor with great view .<ssssss>outside view of hotel - the double height window in the middle be the lobby floor .<ssssss>
3 3 1 2 5 5 5 4		tiny room we stay 4 night in june , be a new hotel and we do not understand why they build so tiny room !<ssssss>we do not have place for the luggage , the bathroom be also very small you can not use the bidet because it be very close to the toilet seat .<ssssss>the staff be very nice and helpfull , the breakfast be very good .<ssssss>the location - 10 minute by bus , the problem be that the bus be full with unlegal worker that live near , the bus stop near the train station at night be realy unpleasent to wait so we have to use a taxi -lrb- 15 eu -rrb- one way .<ssssss>the hotel must have a shutlle to the center if they want to survive !!<ssssss>at least there be a lot of prostitute near the hotel and it be very unpleasent !!<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 2 3 4 -1		you deserve much better as seasoned traveller , my partner and i be very disappointed in we stay at this hotel resort.the hotel need a serious update especially the bathroom with non slip rubber mat in bath , chip enamel vanity basin , old fashion tap fitting , poor lighting and a hairdryer which must have be resurrect from the ark .<ssssss>the room be small and furniture old and worn .<ssssss>this be the deluxe ocean view room at we $ 130 per night +21 % taxes.there must have be a economy drive as we receive only 1 bathsoap in the 4 day we be there.the worst part be that we both get food poisoning from dine at they seafood barbecue on we second night which make we 4 day stay miserable .<ssssss>its not something you expect to get from eat at a suppose 5 star resort .<ssssss>in fact the selection of food offer at they restaurant be substandard and overpriced.the overall ambience of the garden and pond be beautiful and the staff courteous but i think that be more to do with bali 's climate and people than the management.this place be not value for money and do not deserve to be in the hyatt chain !!!!!<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 5 1 2 -1		name say it all , you be cram the hotel cram be a lovely hotel , close to the main attraction of barcelona ; the staff be not particularly friendly ... we have to wait 20 minute to check in upon arrival .<ssssss>we room be suppose to have a bath , but only 6 room have that .<ssssss>every time you use the shower , the entire bathroom get soak , impressive design .<ssssss>the bed barely fit in the room , and that be pretty much all there be .<ssssss>if you like a modern , minimalist hotel , this be for you .<ssssss>it be clean , the closet very much like ikea , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the one thing that we really do like be the cool lighting option , though not label .<ssssss>no alarm clock and no where to sit besides the bed .<ssssss>we will not stay here again , but some might like it - all will agree that you be cram .<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 3 -1 4 -1		slightly above average my husband and i just return from this hotel after spend a full week ; have read all of the review i have alot of apprehension prior to we leave , we have document from we travel agent promise a upgrade even though we pay for a deluxe ocean front room , the room they take we to be overlook the children slide slight view of the ocean in the far ground and a queen size bed.i speak to the front desk and we be switch to la brisas king bed big room big terrace overlook the ocean and the sea , room be okay .<ssssss>buffet breakfast 1st morning decent variety of selection the cost be not post anywhere the charge be 19pp , not bad so the next morning we go back after have the same buffet as the previous day the bill come and it be 25pp when the staff be question noexplanation given.the grounds be beautiful well care for , the private beach be very relaxing but a bother to get to.the meal in the hotel where we exclusively eat be pricey for what be offer .<ssssss>if you like salad or vegetable you will be out of luck here lot of carb with every meal.the staff be very accomadating and very pleasant , the resort be a popular site for corporate event and we get the impression that the resort cater to the large group rather then the vacation traveler .<ssssss>
4 3 4 4 5 2 3 5		one of best in beij clean , modern facility and relatively classy for beij , where everything be full of bauble and ruffle .<ssssss>the room be spacious and have all the amenity you would expect from a hotel of this class.although they claim they hotel staff be bilingual , most only speak very limited english .<ssssss>service be average -- the staff be slow to respond to many request and for the most part do not seem to understand western standard .<ssssss>for instance , at the bar , a waitress spill a red cocktail on my friend 's white dress .<ssssss>she mumble , sorry and clumsily wipe it off the carpet , but do not do anything to help my friend .<ssssss>she do not bring towel , nor do she offer to have the dress dryclean .<ssssss>the waitress also do not offer to take the drink off the bill .<ssssss>all of this be quite distressing but we be loathe to complain because we be have drink with some important business client .<ssssss>i think the kerry centre owe we a apology , a free drink , and a dry cleaning bill.still , compare to other hotel i have stay at in china , i be relatively pleased with my experience at the kerry centre .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 3 5 4 3		great family hotel let I tell you it be hard to find a hotel that have a room that could fit a family of five with out charge double room rate.we stay on ocean view side of one of the tower and it be fabulous !!!!!!<ssssss>big enough for the five of we andthe location be just as great.from the pool area be a fantastic view of diamond head .<ssssss>i would definitly stay here again and have recomend it to friend .<ssssss>

3 2 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		nice - but be aware currently in we last day at the resort - we cut it short by a day to stay in san juan near the airport .<ssssss>book it thru expedia -lrb- never again -rrb- .<ssssss>copamarina ia a pretty resort with a pleasant staff who be attentive .<ssssss>the service pace be slow - same as everywhere down here.general - the ride in be not a good start - past refinery and a fertilizer plant , down a dangerous 1-1/2 lane road along the coast line , against heavy traffic from the neighbor fenced-in muni-beach .<ssssss>we be pretty wind up before we get to the door .<ssssss>layout be strange - front desk and bar/restaurant at one end , all of the room at the other .<ssssss>grounds and pool be attractive and well-maintained .<ssssss>room - just ok - tile floor , but cramped with 2 double .<ssssss>get the superior room - waste of money-actually furthest from the beach and the desk .<ssssss>bathroom be a little oversized , but need some storage for toiletries , etc. metal door be not real attractive , but be freshly paint .<ssssss>tv be out when we arrive - have to call service right away and they respond .<ssssss>food - one restaurant for b-fast and lunch .<ssssss>eat outdoors be enjoyable .<ssssss>when that close at 6 , the fancy dinner restaurant open - but that be all .<ssssss>from 6pm on , no other food -lrb- except chip -rrb- be available .<ssssss>b-fast be basic , but good .<ssssss>for lunch , have the worst club sandwich ever .<ssssss>dinner be very good but long .<ssssss>-lrb- 1-1/2 hr with no drink . -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>no bar with tv - sit in machine in the workout room to see they nice wide screen , but that be lock at 7:00 .<ssssss>service - wi-fi internet be available , but we have to sit on the floor near the door to get a good signal .<ssssss>they hi-speed internet access itself be down half the time and run on a bad 24k backup telephone line for the whole place .<ssssss>cell phone service be erratic .<ssssss>machine wash laundry available - no laundry service .<ssssss>bell service very liimited .<ssssss>refrig .<ssssss>in room.activities - pool and spa be adequate .<ssssss>golf 1 hr .<ssssss>away be good enough .<ssssss>other activity be limit .<ssssss>scuba , snorkele and a short excursion to gilligan 's island be available , but some fishing , motorized water sport , diinner cruise or just a boat ride would have be nice .<ssssss>non-motorized offering be a little lame .<ssssss>good tennis court .<ssssss>best feature and high point of trip be hike in guanica dry forest - just at the end of the road .<ssssss>we trail go along the rugged coastline and rival any scenerysummary - i see truth in most of the review that i read - good or bad .<ssssss>i can recommend copamarina - but only as a quiet getaway .<ssssss>stock up at a local market and hunker down for you stay .<ssssss>but if you like to set up a wide range of thing to do - it be just too far from any action -lrb- day or nite -rrb- to be a good choice .<ssssss>

2 -1 2 5 3 2 2 2		good location , but not such a great hotel we stay at the novotel during the olympics , as part of a package .<ssssss>we have a choice between a chinese hotel and the novotel , and choose the latter , mainly because of it be convenient location right next door to a subway station and a few km .<ssssss>from tianamen square and the forbid city .<ssssss>because of the olympics , the hotel be fully book and staff have to deal with many matter , all new to them.we have ask for a superior room , non-smoking and accord to front desk , that be what we got.our room be on the second floor of the atower , overlook the main entrance and road , which be nice .<ssssss>we be not too pleased with the room , it look very tired and have see better day .<ssssss>no door cover the closet -lrb- so it make it look rather airport-hotellish -rrb- , and the furniture need update , stain on the carpet .<ssssss>the bathroom be very small , with a shower in the bath-tub with a showercurtain which need replace -lrb- full with mould -rrb- .<ssssss>the room have a stale smell and be definitely a smoker 's room .<ssssss>but as we have a full schedule with the game and sightseeing , and would be in the room only for sleep , we decide to stay .<ssssss>as many review have state , the bed be very hard indeed , as that be the way the chinese people like they matrass , but we find they to be really comfortable : you get use to it and it be very good for you back .<ssssss>the a/c be work very well.we later learn that the room in the btower have be renovate : walk-in powershower , flat-screen tv on the wall , iron board and dressingmirror cover the closet .<ssssss>so : ask for a renovate room in the b ' tower : so much more value for money .<ssssss>the first night , house keep come only to close the curtain -lrb- !! -rrb-<ssssss>, the wastebasket be not empty and no clean towel , although we have place they in the bathtub .<ssssss>we learn , that the room in the btower have towelchange twice a day and that the wastebasket be empty .<ssssss>after we complaint with the frontdesk , we learn that the same should be do in we wing and indeed : towelchange in the evening happen once , later no more .<ssssss>so , every night , after we come in , sometimes well after midnight , we have to call housekeeping for clean towels.the shampoo and bodylotion be not replenish , although that should be the case , so we have house-keeping bring it over every night.we ake for a wake-up call a few time : we get it only once , but it be again ` forgottenon the day of we dearture , so we almost miss we flight.a breakfast-buffet in the coffeshop : only guest of the atower be allow in , the guest of the btower have to have breakfast in the stuffy chinese restaurant on the fourth floor.breakfast be ok : plenty of fruit and a choice of egg .<ssssss>but as most guest have they breakfast early in the morning , it happen more than once that at 07.30 there be no more cheese , no more croissant or sweet roll .<ssssss>it take a few day before this problem be solved.the french restaurant la cuisinewa take over by the french official , and we be not allow in .<ssssss>lunch in the coffeeshop take forever : one day we order a hamburger -lrb- we be the only guest -rrb- and it take almost 40 minute before it come on the table.the chinese staff hardly speak any english , but espacially the front desk be staff with a few european lady .<ssssss>when we complain about the non-existent towelchange and the always forget wake-up call -lrb- in a friendly way -rrb- , one of the staff start cry ... later on , one of the chinese staff tell we , that they have learn so much in the course of the olympics .<ssssss>.<ssssss>a really positive sign.two computer for the guest to use in the lobby : normally enough , but during the olympics , you really have to wait you turn -lrb- sometimes for more than 20 minute -rrb- overall : apart from the location , we do not like very much about this hotel .<ssssss>true , it be not expensive , but be sure to ask for a renovate room : the price be the same and you get more value for money.a better option be the novotel peace , about 5 minute away : a little bit more expensive , but a better deal<ssssss>

1 1 1 3 1 3 2 2		it will do for budget traveller but be prepare there be a couple of good thing to say about this hotel ... the best be that there be no curfew and the reception be 24hrs .<ssssss>so no need to worry about get lock out .<ssssss>the people on the reception be always pretty helpful .<ssssss>it be also close to the station .<ssssss>however , when we enter we room there be hole in the ceiling and although the man who clean the room have just leave , it feel and look so unclean , year worth of ingrained dirt that you probably couldnt even get off with cillit bang .<ssssss>cobweb and spider all over the ceiling.there be no toilet roll or towel in the bathroom .<ssssss>then half a hour after check in while i be in the middle of get change , there be a knock on the door and without wait enough time for anyone to get to the door to open it , a man let himself into the room with the toilet roll and towel !<ssssss>the towel i could not bring myself to use and go out to buy some .<ssssss>the pillow be not only half the normal size of a pillow but so thin it be hardly worth bother with and the ` duvet ' be about as useful as the pillows.the room be advertise as have a tv ... it do but the tv screen be tiny and the 3 channel it have be so fuzzy that you just couldnt watch it , no matter how much we try to tune they in better .<ssssss>all in all , if you really dont care and be just look for a place to crash when you get back from a good night out , then its fine , but in that case you be probably better off get a private room in a hostel , it would be cheaper and probably cleaner .<ssssss>if you be look for something halfway decent dont stay at the manofa .<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 2 4 5 -1		be disappoint in location and hygiene base on the other review , i have high expectation on the hotel and location .<ssssss>on both i be disappoint , and i do not consider myself too picky about hotels.the hotel be extremely hard to find .<ssssss>to find the hotel , it would have be helpful to know that i should drive into the westlake condo complex rather than look for a hotel entrance .<ssssss>do not rely on googlemap , it have the hotel in the wrong place .<ssssss>the parking -lrb- $ 28/day plus tip for valet -rrb- seem expensive .<ssssss>there be self-parking next to the whole food right on westlake ave. , but the front desk tell I valet parking be actually more reasonable for guests.the hotel be outside of actual downtown , about a 15-20 minute walk to nordstrom/macy 's in a classy multi-use condo complex with a whole food right below it -lrb- great for snack -rrb- .<ssssss>this area appear to be transform into a new upscale high-rise residential area , but there be little visitor activity in this vicinity .<ssssss>there be a lot of construction go on , with one high rise right across the street go up .<ssssss>perhaps all the construction be reflect in the daily rate of the hotel , but the thick glass keep out most of the noise .<ssssss>a lot of other seattle hotel be much closer if you will be go to the farmer 's market or shopping as a tourist.that say , there be a great italian restaurant recommend by the hotel about 2 block away call barolo .<ssssss>absolutely outstanding food and service , and the best food we have in seattle during we stay.our modern room be enormous and a gorgeous japanese-onsen -lrb- spa -rrb- inspire bathroom .<ssssss>window in the bathroom be huge , but of clear glass -lrb- even in the toilet room ! -rrb-<ssssss>so we keep the blind tilted or close for privacy .<ssssss>separate shower and bathtub .<ssssss>shoji-inspired door slide open if you want to make the bathroom part of the bedroom .<ssssss>bed be decent , but not of westin or four season caliber .<ssssss>there be a lot of b-i-g stain and dirt on the carpeting , something i would not expect of a luxury hotel .<ssssss>because there be two handle place right next to each other on the very edge of the wardrobe closet door , i smash my finger in the handle daily .<ssssss>strangely , there be only one upholstered chair in we room , so one person always have to sit on the bed.service at the front desk and valet be care , prompt and courteous .<ssssss>the dramatic , clean-lined modern lobby be of the latest urban design use a lot of zebra wood paneling.the hotel serve breakfast in the be for its guest in the bar .<ssssss>price for a luxury hotel be not unreasonable , about $ 15 for a egg omelette , coffee extra .<ssssss>this whole food also serve breakfast : you order at cashier and they bring the food to you .<ssssss>very inexpensive , in fact a lot of the construction worker across the street come by for the coffee and healthy food .<ssssss>
1 1 2 4 -1 3 -1 3		keep on drive !<ssssss>the first thing we notice be the lack of mark for the entry to the hotel .<ssssss>we drive around the block after miss it .<ssssss>the carpet in the main lobby , stair and hall be wear and especially stain and dirty.the room have dirty mattress and box spring side that be expose due to ill-fitting sheet and lack of matress cover or dust ruffels.the toilet do not flush efficiently , and almost overflow .<ssssss>water pipe groan and squeek .<ssssss>the door to the room have a gap at the door jam that be easy to peek through!other than that , the wall be very thin and all ajoin room sound be clearly heard.i will not be stay there again !<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 5 4 2 -1		fantastic hotel this be my first trip to amsterdam so i be unsure what to expect.the hotel itself be fantastic very boutique and modern .<ssssss>i be in my 20 's and with my boyfriend and it suit we perfectly .<ssssss>we book last minute so be unsure as to whether we would get a decent room.we arrive at the hotel early but we room be ready which be great .<ssssss>the hotel have only 40 room spread between the first and second floor .<ssssss>we be on the second floor in room 210 which be around the side of the building .<ssssss>the room be fantastic .<ssssss>it have high ceiling with expose wooden beam and a bath to die for.every evening staff arrive at the room with a bottle of cold water and chocolate just what you need after a day of sightseeing .<ssssss>they service the room whenever you like and turn down the bed each evening.the only downside to the hotel be the road noise which be due to the original wooden window .<ssssss>it be not a very busy road its probably just because i be a light sleeper .<ssssss>the oher down side be the room be quite dark there be only lamp to light the room and corridor with downlighter in the bathroom , this make it difficult to have a shower as you be practically in darkness.the location of the hotel be what i be most worried about , i think it be go to be mile away from the centre .<ssssss>its actually 5-8 minute walk from the museum centre where the rembrant , van gough museum be .<ssssss>it be a 10 minute tram ride to dam square which be probably the furthest you need to go as everything else be inbetween .<ssssss>i would recommend leisplein for a few drink on a night , very safe and some good bar and restaurants.trams run from directly outside of the hotel and you can get the 5 or 24 to central station and it stop at all of the main attraction on the way .<ssssss>we never wait more than 5 minute for a tram to arrive which be great as you do not want to spend you break wait for transport.staff at the hotel be not brilliant but we expect that before we go , they be student after all .<ssssss>the one on reception be great but the waiter and chef at breakfast in the hotel be useless .<ssssss>one day we breakfast order be incorrect 3 time so we just give up and eat what we be give .<ssssss>toast be serve 20 minute after the scramble egg so it be cold .<ssssss>it be little thing s like that which be annoying as it be nothing to do with there ability it be common sense.when we check out of the hotel we ask to leave we bag as we want to go sightseeing this be do without issue .<ssssss>however when we go to settle we bill they try to charge we 70 euro for room service which we have not have .<ssssss>this take a while to sort out but eventually they realsy that we be not go to pay.all in all a fantastic hotel but if you be expect 5 * service think again .<ssssss>you have to be patient with they but i be start to get feed up with the lack of common sense .<ssssss>

1 1 3 3 3 2 1 -1		terrible 04/03/07we stay at the occidental 03/23/07 to 03/30/07 and have a miserable time .<ssssss>the resort itself look beautiful , however most of the staff be very rude .<ssssss>especially the bartender , when you order a drink they give the impression that you be bother they .<ssssss>on most day or night the power would go off , not really bad in the daytime but at night it be ridiculous .<ssssss>one day and night the electric be off for more than 12 hour straight .<ssssss>and if the power go out none of the plumbing work at all .<ssssss>that include all run water and the toilet do not function either .<ssssss>we have stay many time in mexico at all inclusive resort and have be pampered at each resort .<ssssss>there be no pampering at this hotel .<ssssss>no poolside service-no room service etc. the grounds be not lay out very well either , and be poorly organize .<ssssss>when it rain a lot of the first floor room flood , and they have to shut down part of the buffet area because of sever roof leak .<ssssss>the food however be pretty good .<ssssss>we will never stay there again .<ssssss>
4 3 2 -1 5 -1 3 -1		overall a good choice we travel together with another family - four adult , two teens and a six year old .<ssssss>we book through apple vacation at the beginning of january .<ssssss>because the week we want be april/easter break , most of the resort be already fill .<ssssss>dominicana be not we first choice , but it turn out to be a great place to stay .<ssssss>this be we fourth dominican vacation.the 45 minute to the resort seem like a really long ride , but check in be easier than most .<ssssss>you be give a envelope with wrist band , towel card , key and info , then send to a table for orientation .<ssssss>we skip this part and go directly to we room .<ssssss>keep in mind that room assignment be make prior to you arrival .<ssssss>the front desk clerk do not have the authority to change you room at check in .<ssssss>if you want to change room , speak to the manager and most likely you will get a new room assignment the follow day.room : ours be on the pool side # 4263 .<ssssss>i believe that 4 stand for the building , 2 stand for third floor and 63 be the actual room number .<ssssss>although it be a 4 story building , when you get into the elevator you can see that ground floor be zero so go figure !<ssssss>the higher the room number , the closer you will be to the beach .<ssssss>odd number be poolside , even number room look onto the bavaro bungalow and caribbean street .<ssssss>the building themselves , dominicana and punta cana be nearly identical and face each other .<ssssss>the landscaping at these resort be well above average .<ssssss>there be maze like pathway and garden between the two building that lead to the pool and lobby.the most striking thing be the interior space within the building itself .<ssssss>the room be all situate around a fabulous inner atrium with fountain , lush palm tree , reflect water garden and hang plant .<ssssss>the sound of the run water within this space eliminate the usual hallway noise , voice and door banging .<ssssss>the room itself be somewhat of a disappointment .<ssssss>although it be quite large , with a very private balcony and great partial ocean/pool view , the paint and fabric be in sad shape .<ssssss>not terrible , but not great .<ssssss>the bathroom be nice , smallish tub , large mirror , hair dryer , stone tile .<ssssss>housekeeper do a excellent job .<ssssss>towel sculpture and fresh flower be provide each day .<ssssss>-lrb- no coffee maker or umbrella in room -rrb- .<ssssss>a covered tile walkway on the bavaro side of the building allow you to walk all the way to the lobby and restaraunt , very nice if it rain .<ssssss>we also see several people in wheel chair , so it appear to be fairly handicapped accessible .<ssssss>there be no actual oceanfront room that we could see , and the way the main building be lay out , no one be at a real disadvantage location wise except for the suite .<ssssss>they be the farthest from beach and pool , and do not look much different from the standard room , perhaps fresher paint.beach and pool : great pool but in most area the water be over 5 foot deep , shallow part be limit , something to be aware of with young child .<ssssss>there be a small kiddie pool , water temp be nice and warm .<ssssss>chair under palapa be take by 7:30 am , so plan accordingly .<ssssss>the beach be fantastic - the water be warm with a fairly calm surf and sandy bottom .<ssssss>chair under palapa seem impossible to get , but plenty of extra chair in the sun .<ssssss>several other resort side by side , so lot of people walk along the beach.bars : there be about 5 bar scatterd throughout the dominicana side .<ssssss>while at the pool we discover a small corner bar that be never crowd on the punta cana side .<ssssss>this be also where you will find the best lunch - rotisserie chicken , fish , roast pork , beef and soft serve ice cream for the kid .<ssssss>at night this be the steak restaraunt .<ssssss>bartender seem to be very conservative while pour .<ssssss>unless you specifically ask , you be give just a smidge of alcohol .<ssssss>most drink be a very sweet premixture with a tiny amount of alcohol already in it - if you ask for more they sort of roll they eye at you .<ssssss>tip help .<ssssss>presidente beer be on tap and cold , so that be o.k. the lobby bar in the evening be much nicer.food : overall pretty typical .<ssssss>- other reviewer have give good description .<ssssss>one thing that set the iberostar apart from other dominican resort be the quality of they meat .<ssssss>it be far better than any other dominican resort we have be to .<ssssss>vegetarian might have a bit of a challenge , but they do have pasta at the buffet .<ssssss>a la carte 's ... nothing great , the appetizer at the chinese be a favorite .<ssssss>not too much difficulty get reservation .<ssssss>buffet be never crowd , dine room be pretty , plenty of table .<ssssss>red and white wine pour at dinner .<ssssss>the wine be also better than other dominican resort we have be to .<ssssss>entertainment : the casino be small but nice , most in we group come out ahead .<ssssss>we do not watch much of the show , but we six year old find a giant , overweight , sleepy chicken that hang out near the stage bar each night , to be he entertainment .<ssssss>check out/departure : the apple desk give we a 10:20 be pick up time for a 12:20 pm flight .<ssssss>we think that be cut it a bit close ... but we trust they judgement ... at 9:00 be we get a call from the front desk that the bus be wait for we !!<ssssss>the person who arrange the time the day before have mess up.near panic-husband and son be at the pool for a final swim .<ssssss>emmanual , the apple rep be fantastic .<ssssss>after several animated phone call on he part , and a quite bit of shout in spanish to whoever be on the other end , we be finally send a private taxi .<ssssss>we watch he pay the driver with he own money.overall a great vacation !<ssssss>feel free to email .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 5 4		very nice resort !<ssssss>we recently just return from we stay at the wyndham for a week - 8/2 - 8/9 .<ssssss>this be a family trip that include myself , my spouse , my 17 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter .<ssssss>from a true resort perspective , i think the resort be great - beautiful grounds , facility and service !<ssssss>the employee be all friendly and helpful and very accomodating -lrb- although the only issue we have be that we wait quite a while for check in as we arrive around 1 pm and be tell we room be not ready and each time we call to check they say it be too soon and when press for a time it be first 4 , 4:30 and then 5 and state that all time be approximate -rrb- .<ssssss>unlike some other review , we have a oceanview room that be quiet and clean on a timely basis -lrb- the only noise issue we have be that when the door close they be heavy and very loud but other than that there be no other noise that be even remotely detectable .<ssssss>i will agree that it be quite pricey for in house amenity and we do not rent a car as my husband do not like to drive so we be pretty confine to the in house dining option .<ssssss>but , i also will say that all of the meal be very good .<ssssss>we try a variety of the restaurant and i can say we be not disappoint with the quality of the food .<ssssss>and , i will say that all of the server be excellent !!<ssssss>the real downside that we find be that there be really nothing for we 17 yr old to do .<ssssss>thank goodness he bring he laptop to use each evening in the lobby - it save we sanity .<ssssss>additionally , even though we 12 yr old be pretty much tired every evening after play in the ocean -lrb- truly beautiful -rrb- all day - there be not a lot for she either other than the water slide and hair braiding .<ssssss>the dive-in movie on friday and saturday be great and you may want to consider offer that on more evening as it be helpful with the younger one !!<ssssss>suggestion - may want to consider offer a more reasonable all-inclusive option , especially for family who appear to be the majority of you visitor .<ssssss>overall , we really enjoy we stay here and i would come back again but without child .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful and the service be great !!<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 5 1 1 -1		have to disagree ... .<ssssss>i have to diagree with the otherwise very positive review post for this hotel .<ssssss>i book a oceanview room that be nothing like the picture post on the hotel website .<ssssss>the front desk say that a lot of people have point that out ... .<ssssss>the ` oceanview ' be more a view of two build site -lrb- the trump tower will eventually obliterate musch of the hotel view -rrb- .<ssssss>i be tell the duty manager would call I back but he/she never do .<ssssss>the room be nicely fit out but small compare to most embassy suite .<ssssss>but the wall be paper thin - even regular conversation can be hear .<ssssss>the room on one side have some kid who where very noisy .<ssssss>whilst its great that the kid be have fun , i didnt really want to b e part of that experience !<ssssss>the breakfast be well handle and could easily accomodate a large number of visitors.i be pay $ 339 but get oceanfront at the nearby sheraton for $ 289 - so i cancel my remailing 4 night and will move to the sheraton today .<ssssss>

4 3 3 5 5 1 1 1		the best location in barcelona .<ssssss>the hotel be average .<ssssss>the staff be rude .<ssssss>royal rambla have the best location in barcelona .<ssssss>on the rambla , close to the plaza catalunia and la boqueria.the hotel be average .<ssssss>small room , clean but with a terrible shower .<ssssss>they give I a back view room.the wi-fus acess be not free , be very expensive .<ssssss>but the worst thing in the hotel be the rude staff.when i arrive , my safe box be out of order .<ssssss>after 3 phone call , nothing happen .<ssssss>i try to fix it during my 3 day stay , without any success.there be a construction -lrb- and noise too -rrb- just beside my room -lrb- a neighbor building -rrb- .<ssssss>the same happen ... i call the front desk several time , and even with the promisse of a room change , nothing hapened.the worst of all : the whole hotel become out of light at midnight .<ssssss>on the next day , when i speak to the manager about all that mess , he only say : that be not my problem .<ssssss>it be the light concessionary problem ... what a shame ... one the day before my departure , the front desk forget to wake I up ... if it happen one day later , i could lose my plane ... i be give a 4 star quotation for the hotel , just because of the location -lrb- be absolutely the best -rrb- .<ssssss>otherwise , it would be a 2 star rate .<ssssss>

4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		great location , beware lower floor stunning exterior .<ssssss>room decor be very nice .<ssssss>mini bar refrigerator come in very handy .<ssssss>a annoyance : the bathtub/shower have a partial wall -lrb- cover about the first third -rrb- , so when you shower , water can spray all over the bathroom floor -lrb- why not install a shower curtain instead ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>rooftop pool be small , but the fact that there even be a pool be greatly appreciate .<ssssss>another annoyance be that we have no view .<ssssss>we be in room 338 -lrb- 4th floor to american -rrb- we window face another building -lrb- like maybe 10 foot away -rrb- .<ssssss>so we really could not even see the sky .<ssssss>i would suggest that you ask for something on the 5th floor or higher , or better still , ask about a room in the front of the building.regarding the surroundings , passeig de gracia have many high end clothing store in the vicinity .<ssssss>about 2 block north be gaudi 's la pedrera a absolute must do -- it be amazing -lrb- allow at least a hour -rrb- .<ssssss>a block south be a smaller gaudus building -lrb- but i do not visit it -rrb- .<ssssss>a subway station be 3 block north -lrb- the diagonal station -rrb- .<ssssss>note about the subway , some of the subway line have lever on the slide door .<ssssss>if you see a lever , you will have to turn it for the door to open -lrb- either board the subway , or exit it -rrb- .<ssssss>dine out a couple block south be tapa tapa which we do not care for .<ssssss>a trick they use be to provide you with bread top with tomato sauce .<ssssss>this be not free .<ssssss>they also give we a bowl of olive which we send back .<ssssss>but we think the bread be include and be not.next to tapa tapa be citrus , which be upstairs .<ssssss>here the bread actually be include , and we have a very good meal.across the street be tenorio , which have a delicious goat cheese salad -lrb- a must get -rrb- .<ssssss>but tenorio hit we with two extra that we have to pay for ... again the bread top with tomato -lrb- you would think we would learn ! -rrb-<ssssss>and a cheese plate -lrb- which be delicious -rrb- .<ssssss>however , these two item probably add 10 euro to we total bill.also just south of the hotel be several inexpensive place for a quick bite , such as mcdonald 's , fresh ready , and another place across the street.oh , and for a large selection of yummy italian gelato , visit arlequin gelateria which be right across from gaudi 's sagrada familia another must do -lrb- and do go up the elevator for stunning view as well -rrb- .<ssssss>oh and one more must do , visit placa espana for the fountain show after dark on weekend .<ssssss>i think this may have be the inspiration for the fountain of bellagio in las vegas .<ssssss>they have a fountain show correograph to color light and music -- it be wonderful.oh , one more lesson learn .<ssssss>the taxi from the airport to hotel majestic be roughly 20 to 23 euro and be meter .<ssssss>we take a cruise , and after the cruise take a taxi to the airport .<ssssss>the distance to the airport be the same , but the taxi turn off they meter and charge we a whopping 35 euro to take we to the airport -- almost double of what it would have be if it be a metered ride -lrb- and he be bold enough to ask for a tip ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>if you cruise ship offer transportation , you may save money go that route .<ssssss>otherwise , you be totally at the mercy of the taxi at the port -- you have no other choice , so they can charge whatever they feel like.none-the-less , barcelona be a clean and wonderous city -- i could live there !<ssssss>enjoy !<ssssss>
4 3 5 2 5 5 5 -1		lot of street noise i have stay at the colon many year ago when in barcelona on business .<ssssss>therefore the regencia colon attrract my attention as i like the colon .<ssssss>both hotel be very well located in the heart of the city with public transporation near by and the famous rambla just a few minute away on foot.the hotel be lovely with a good size room , a nice bathroom , a helpful front office crew , and a very good breakfast for 10 euro .<ssssss>barcelona be a expensive city so 135 euro for a double seem reasonable.i would suggest that one find a quieter place if sleeping be a priority .<ssssss>reveler , garbage truck and construction never cease .<ssssss>other than that , the hotel be fine .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 4 1 1 -1		poor customer service we book this hotel via a secret hotel on last minute.com.we book it because it be central .<ssssss>the standard room be ok but the bed be uncomfortable.the facility be not those that you would expect at a 4 star hotel .<ssssss>e.g. when we ask about tea and coffee in the room we be tell this be only for superior room ` people ' .<ssssss>there be no restaurant , the breakfast be expensive and not to the standard expect in germany .<ssssss>the staff be unfriendly and generally unhelpful .<ssssss>on check-out the clerk on reception try to charge we for the water in the room -lrb- there be no mention of this in the room-4euros 50 !! -rrb-<ssssss>and also question the fact that we only have breakfast once in the hotel .<ssssss>when try to get a drink from the bar at reception -lrb- no mini-bar -rrb- one have to stand around until the staff could be bother to serve you-the telephone appear to be far more important than a stay guest .<ssssss>the coffee be eventually nice but cold.so all in all we would not recommend this hotel unless you be ok with unfriendly service .<ssssss>

4 5 4 4 4 5 4 1		no worry about stay here we just get back from stay 4 night at the frenchman and it be a real delight .<ssssss>while i do not think that it be a great pick for everyone , it be exactly what i have be look for in a new orlean hotel .<ssssss>be in the marigney be a great choice for anyone that enjoy the quarter but would enjoy it more if there be not so many giantic silly drink in everyone hand .<ssssss>there be great bar up frenchman street and down decatur especially if bourbon street hold nothing for you .<ssssss>the hotel be great .<ssssss>it be very quaint and friendly .<ssssss>while the room be small , -lrb- especially the bathroom -rrb- the bed be unbelievably comfortable .<ssssss>the pool be great for just take a dip and we be happy to discover that the 12:00 be closure be more of a mild suggestion than anything else .<ssssss>if you end up drive , they do have a secure parking lot , however there be very few space for car and move around inside of it be very tight at best , i would recommend parking somewhere else if you have a large car , although it be secure , at $ 15 a night there be better deal to be find in the area .<ssssss>the room be very clean as be the other public area of the hotel , however the maid service could stand to remember they be in a courtyard and that voice carry as we be awoken most morning by they banter .<ssssss>
5 3 5 5 5 4 5 3		good hotel , great location i book this hotel base only on the review from this website .<ssssss>the hotel location be fantastic , we soon learn that take a taxi be not worth it , just walk , or jump on the subway .<ssssss>great staff , very clean room.some of the best food and shopping can be find within 5 min walk.a few point to not but note even worth mention .<ssssss>the room be spacious and very clean .<ssssss>shower could have be a bit better but good enough.will book it again when we return .<ssssss>

2 2 3 3 2 4 4 2		great staff , old furnishings and decor i have stay with the other affinia hotel and have always have a great experience .<ssssss>i be expect the same level of room as the other hotel .<ssssss>let I first say that the eastgate tower 's staff be courteous , professional and extremely accomodate .<ssssss>the hotel itself be in a great neighborhood and very convenient to many site .<ssssss>but the hotel be extremely outdated and its decor look like it be from the 1980 's .<ssssss>the bed be uncomfortable and the pull out sofa 's mattress be almost nonexistent .<ssssss>we have to pile two sofa mattress on top of each other for it to be decent .<ssssss>the room have a funky smell and the bathroom be all white but look yellow .<ssssss>i would rate we overall stay as just okay .<ssssss>i will not be return until they update this hotel .<ssssss>
3 -1 3 5 3 3 3 1		just normal !<ssssss>stay from 24 - 28 sep. we choose it because it be conveniently located near the convention hall and chinatown .<ssssss>be stay on level 4 .<ssssss>the room be not as new as my colleague who be stay on level 7 .<ssssss>as a business traveller , i be expect the wireless internet to work well .<ssssss>to my disappointment , internet connectivity be very slow .<ssssss>to make it worst , i do not even have a proper write desk inside my room which make answering of email a tedious chore !!!<ssssss>i stay in other hotel in sydney before .<ssssss>therefore , this hotel be certainly not my choice when i return to sydney for work again !<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 3 5 5 3		great price , great location i recently stay at parc55 and be very happy with it .<ssssss>for the price that we pay , and the location , it be great !<ssssss>it be walk distance to all the best shopping , a quick cab ride to all the good club , and ton of excellent restaurant all around .<ssssss>i would definitely recommend parc55 .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 4 4 2 4		great location and breakfast this be a large hotel with all the service include .<ssssss>it look posh with over staffing everywhere from driveway attendant to downstairs entry information -lrb- 1st floor -rrb- then reception , lobby attendant and foreign visitor information that double as a porter 's desk -lrb- but no porter -rrb- on level 3 -lrb- lb , short for lobby -rrb- .<ssssss>my wife and i struggle with 3 bags and a 2 year old child , my wife be 5 month pregnant .<ssssss>i be offer no help with the bag at any time but all staff watch we fumble we way into the lobby then to we room .<ssssss>for a service country i find this a disgrace.we check in and be give a smoking room that be tiny and smell like a ashtray -lrb- smoking be common in japan -rrb- .<ssssss>we swap to a non smoking room and the room be more modern and within the room be a tiny round table useless -lrb- remove -rrb- and pants press -lrb- remove -rrb- and a massage chair with knead and shiatsu setting that be too big to move .<ssssss>it be also very good .<ssssss>the room be tiny and it have a small non-opening window.the entertainment unit be connect to a intra net where you could get rj45 net connection and a variety of speed -lrb- be best in the morning when the businessman have leave -rrb- .<ssssss>also connect be video on demand and tv and a few other quite simple information.the room once empty of round table and pants press be quite nice and although a small room it be well appoint .<ssssss>the bed be against the wall.we have no problem get a extra towel and other bits.the normal capsule type bathroom be the largest of the 4 hotel we do stay at in japan.breakfast be include and be great , with a wide variety of western and japanese food available.we do travel with a child of 2 and the hotel make no attempt to create any extra or help or obvious immediate help without be ask .<ssssss>i be tell that i be only allow one room key .<ssssss>i be give another after i begged for about 10 minute as my pregnant wife do not want to be wake up at 3 am when i arrive home at night and that she would need power while i be gone.some staff speak english and some staff should never have enter the hospitality industry but at the same time some staff be great .<ssssss>i believe if you work in a international hotel as a lobby attendant you should at least be willing to try and listen to guest instead of walk off -lrb- obviously -rrb- and help someone else.the smoking room we have originally be give be smelly and somewhat oddly wrong , but the second room -lrb- non smoking -rrb- be great , if not small for 3 people and 3 bags and the desire to stand in the room at the same time .<ssssss>however we extend we stay in this room as the breakfast and the location where very very good .<ssssss>and the room have all modern amenities.the room be sometimes very hot and the air con only have low , medium or high setting only .<ssssss>check in and check out be sometimes meet with a line .<ssssss>i might stay here again if average could not be find cheaper some place else locally .<ssssss>
3 4 2 1 4 5 3 -1		quick 2 night away too far way from the centre , very very basic but clean enough .<ssssss>we only book because it be cheap but now we realise why !<ssssss>you only get what you pay for .<ssssss>20 min from the centre by tube and a 10 minute uphill walk from the tube station .<ssssss>nothing in the surround area , seem to be residential .<ssssss>i would only stay there again if every other hotel in central barcelona be fully book !!!<ssssss>in my honest opinon hotel be ok if you do not mind plan you trip by the tube timetable ...<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 2 3 3 -1		confused have just read the last few review for brunelleschus hotel , i be somewhat confused ... be this the same hotel we stay in last summer ??<ssssss>we have previously stay in hotel three year earlier and be quite pleased .<ssssss>however , last year we room be awful .<ssssss>dingy , small room , brown nylon bed spread , pillow case and curtain to match make the room extremely dull and very sixty , worn carpet , run down bathroom , oh and the roll of old sticking plaster just visible under the bed -lrb- and cover in dust -rrb- seal we disappointment .<ssssss>all in all , i believe the hotel have deteriot over the yearsi agree , a wonderful location , but would never return .<ssssss>obviously , look at traveller photo , there be much nicer room , but none offer to we .<ssssss>very disappointing for a 4 star hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 3 -1 2		acceptable economy hotel , not for everyone we stay here for 5 night while my husband attend a conference , but we would not stay here again.good bit : very reasonable price , convenient location -lrb- almost next to u-bahn stop -rrb- , safe neighborhood , acceptable food , adequate servicebad bit : the bed be not intend for 2 people , much too small .<ssssss>plus , we be both tall people -lrb- about 6 foot tall -rrb- and we foot hang off the end .<ssssss>the bed be very lumpy and uncomfortable .<ssssss>plus , the sheet duvet be 100 % polyester .<ssssss>extremely scratchy and way too warm .<ssssss>it be also near a hospital and there be siren all night long.if you be someone inclined towards sleep issue , do not stay here !<ssssss>i get next to no sleep on this trip and spend my day wander about in a daze from sleep deprivation.meanwhile , my husband sleep like a log and lose no sleep whatsoever .<ssssss>i spend my night wish desperately for sleep and suppress a overwhelming desire to poke he for be able to sleep so well !<ssssss>
4 1 5 -1 2 -1 1 -1		great , but ... .<ssssss>well the room be great .<ssssss>i stay in the tower on a upper floor .<ssssss>the bed be one of the most comfortable i have sleep in all my life !<ssssss>the view be incrediable .<ssssss>i sit in front of the window , drink a beer , and take it all in .<ssssss>but ... this be where it start .<ssssss>that beer which i get from the mini bar be $ 12 !<ssssss>everything be obscenely over price here .<ssssss>$ 27.50 for a average martini in the hotel bar , $ 15 for a hors derve tray , that be nothing more than cracker and cheese .<ssssss>$ 50 for the breakfast buffet !<ssssss>thats just plain insulting to you guest .<ssssss>it seem like the st. francis be one big clip joint .<ssssss>even the wealthy guest tell I , they feel take advantage of .<ssssss>the staff , be very unfriendly , and i be shock that professional service people could act this way .<ssssss>i will not stay here again .<ssssss>the bed and view , be not worth it .<ssssss>
4 4 5 2 5 5 5 1		nice room i stay here for 5 day in january for a business conference .<ssssss>the room be large and the bed be very big and comfortable .<ssssss>all of the conference room be large and the staff be very accomodating .<ssssss>most of the cater food be good , but the price in pitch -lrb- the hotel sport bar -rrb- be very high for slow service and sub-par food .<ssssss>the hotel be a way away from all of the action in miami , but they do offer a shuttle service for $ 5 per person each way .<ssssss>one major thumb down be the fact that they do not offer free internet service .<ssssss>if you would like to use the internet in you room , it be roughly $ 13 a day .<ssssss>i have stay in much worse hotel than this that have offer free wireless , so i think that be a little ridiculous .<ssssss>overall , this be a nice hotel but if i be go to miami for leisure , i would stay elsewhere .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 3 -1 4 -1		on the whole ... fab i have to say that most of the review be spot on .<ssssss>it be a lovely little hotel , great value , great location , nice staff , and i would without a doubt stay there again .<ssssss>they be a couple of thing that other have mention which be also true , thin wall -lrb- feel like someone else be in the room -rrb- and it be a bit of a tight squeeze around the bed , but that be it .<ssssss>i have friend stay in one of the suite and that be great , so if you want a bit more of a treat for a extra 30 euro book one of those .<ssssss>

2 1 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		this property should not carry the ritz name i still can not believe all of the five star review for this hotel .<ssssss>pro : close to the airport , on the beach , decent pool.cons : close to the airport , beach be not beautiful -lrb- water look almost black/mud like substance , -rrb- too many young child -lrb- under 10 , -rrb- rooms/lobby/casino need to be update , nothing worth see be with in walk distance , ocean view room 's window do not open/no balcony ?<ssssss>food in pool restaurant be sub par , the upscale restaurant prim 787 be not very good either .<ssssss>i pay roughly $ 400 a night for a ocean front room .<ssssss>i feel as though the experience be worth $ 89 a night .<ssssss>i would not return and i be still amaze at the positive review of this hotel .<ssssss>
2 2 2 1 3 3 1 -1		bad apple rating !<ssssss>we have just return from we vacation we be very disappointed .<ssssss>this be we first time in punta cana .<ssssss>we have hear very nice thing about the island but i will think twice before i return , especially if i be use apple as a guide to rating be we stay .<ssssss>it seem that dream be very overated in we opinion .<ssssss>the place be beautiful in the lobby the grounds very clean for the most part .<ssssss>but the service , the food the room be another thing .<ssssss>but first can i just say that anyone thinking of book at this place please note that there be a ride from hell to get there .<ssssss>this be something that they do not tell you .<ssssss>you be a hour or so from the airport .<ssssss>we come in at night i think that we i would be sick just from the bus ride .<ssssss>now once we arrive the check in be okay , just glad that it be not very busy because they do not move very fast .<ssssss>we be able to get something to eat even though the buffet be about to close ... one of the waiter , miguel , from the italian restaurant , be very helpful in get we somenthe to eat , which would turn out to be we most visit spot .<ssssss>this be the only area be the service be okay .<ssssss>in the buffet area which be share by the italian restaurant in the corner of the big room , the service be terrible .<ssssss>a few buck or a complaint at the apple desk just might get you want you think be include in the price you be pay for a six golden apple rating ... the room be small but nice except for the bathroom ... no walk in shower in the regular room ... just very high tub to climb in out of with a make shift shower ... no tippy no towel for we room ... no tippy no service after you sit for a meal at the buffet .<ssssss>you have fend for yourself ... now the food be not what you think it might be so brace yourself if you be book at this place .<ssssss>very poor menu display of what dessert that they have .<ssssss>if it be not that it be too salty then it do not have any taste at all .<ssssss>all the fruit you could ask for but sometimes not ripe do watch for that .<ssssss>pool be okay for the most part .<ssssss>beach really suck !!!!<ssssss>big time .<ssssss>remember that you be on the atlantic side of the island so the beach the water be not paradise !!<ssssss>just full of seaweed rock ... no other resort nearby so be careful of walk on the beach out from the resort area ... entertainment need vast imporvement ... disco need to know that there be other people who would like to dance listen to the music besides the native people who visit the resort ... the only part that i would rate very good be the young people who entertain you by the pool ... the game activity , these guy just be very good at what they do to boot they be part of the entertainment at night which might explain as to the lack of it for wokr from 9 to 12 every day ... if this be my first place that i have visit i might think it be okay but we have go to other place this by no means should be rate a 6 golden apple place ... at best maybe a 4 red ... you live you learn as they say so i learn that a great rating do not alway mean it be what you get for you money so be careful<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 3 3 3		a bit old but happen hotel .<ssssss>hard rock photoshoot<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 3 1 3 2		fantastic location and view ; slightly below average hotel stay here the week of july 16 for a conference .<ssssss>i give this hotel a b. the location be excellent and the room size , decor and finish be generally ok .<ssssss>the biggest negative to this hotel be that you get the sense that it be simply underequipped for its size .<ssssss>i can vouch for the comment about long wait for a elevator .<ssssss>although there be about 10-12 elevator , you have to wait a long time for one , even at off peak hour .<ssssss>the check in desk be also significantly understaff ; they definitely need more people there during peak hour , such as when people be check out in the morning .<ssssss>the line be long .<ssssss>i be attend a large conference on the second floor and everyone be try to get between the first and second floor , but the escalator be out of service for most of the time i be there , force everyone to wait 10 minute for a elevator each time you need to get down to the lobby.the room be spacious for a regular hotel room .<ssssss>the furniture be recently update .<ssssss>the desk area , which be comprise of a slide out glass half desk and a padded stool on wheel , be not that comfortable if you actually try to get work do -lrb- and i recognize that most stay in waikikus be not -rrb- .<ssssss>and there be no wifi available in any of the guest room , although it be available in certain area on the ground floor .<ssssss>the quality of the in-room coffee be horrible -lrb- i do not generally expect a whole lot from the complimentary in-room drip coffee , but this be truly nasty stuff -rrb- .<ssssss>for the discounted conference rate of $ 210 i pay for a partial ocean view , it be not a bad deal because of the location .<ssssss>the on-site concierge be pretty useless .<ssssss>i have a spare afternoon and want to sign up for a afternoon kayak tour .<ssssss>they say they do not know of any .<ssssss>this be a major hotel in the heart of waikiki and they do not know of any kayak tour ?<ssssss>i go to a hotel next door and in about 30 seconds the concierge there give I 3 different option .<ssssss>
1 3 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		need help !<ssssss>we arrive and the hotel staff be so-so but when we get to we room it be a shock .<ssssss>it just get worse and worse .<ssssss>you walk in and the hotel lobby be all right but as you move closer to you room it get bad .<ssssss>we shower be moldy and to showerhead be not high enough so ii have to bend over quite a bit .<ssssss>-lrb- i be 6 foot -rrb- .<ssssss>i have some friend that be stay in another room and they have problem with they toliet .<ssssss>the bed be ok but i have sleep in better .<ssssss>one thing that be excellent about the hotel be that it be very close to public transportation .<ssssss>also within walk distance of lombard street if you dont mind climb the hill .<ssssss>-lrb- walk be not bad -rrb- overall if you want a cheap place in sf and you dont mind that much this be the place for you , but i be never stay again .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 4 1 2 3		bel hotel mais ... .<ssssss>vu sur le bulding un<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 3 3 -1		still have back pain my sister and i stay at this hotel for three night after a cruise .<ssssss>although it be not a bad hotel and have some good point such as be in walk distance from shopping area , restarant and la ramba we find the bed to be almost unbearable they be as hard as brick .<ssssss>most night my sister could not lay on the bed for more than a couple of hour at a time she choose to sit in one of the chair because they be more comfortable .<ssssss>another thing be eventhought , they have a wonderful large screen televison there be no english channel .<ssssss>so my sugestion would be if you do not enjoy sleep on a hard bed do not stay at this hotel .<ssssss>
3 1 1 4 5 4 5 -1		friendly staff , small room i stay in a partial ocean view room which have a ok view .<ssssss>.<ssssss>could have upgrade to ocean view room but didnt think i be go to stay at the hotel for long anyway.i find the room to be very small there be no where to put you luggage .<ssssss>its basicly just 2 double bed in the room and a tv not much space to walk or put any shopping its the size of a small bedroom .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny and the shower be like a little cave .<ssssss>i hate shower there.the staff be very friendly and they provide free towel to take to the beach .<ssssss>the hotel have no pool.to be honest its not that bad .<ssssss>the room be clean just i find they really small and have stay at other hotel for better value money .<ssssss>great location though for the beach .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 3 3 -1 -1		worst case of paper-thin wall ever experience the hotel be overall really nice look , great location .<ssssss>but soon enough we find out the wall be paper-thin .<ssssss>do not even consider get any sleep in this hotel - any little noise from the neighbor you will hear as if it be in you room .<ssssss>tv , people walk , people talk , dog scratch -lrb- it be pet-friendly -rrb- , toilet , shower .<ssssss>people 's conversation be not even muffle by the wall , you can understand every word !<ssssss>you will not sleep , i promise .<ssssss>
3 3 4 4 5 1 3 4		good property - poor service the property be new and nice - room be large and well decorate , bathroom design be excellent .<ssssss>bed and linen be sub-par .<ssssss>the service be , in my opinion , poor .<ssssss>the ability to deal with customer ' request with finesse leave the customer satisfied distinguish a high-class property from a run-of-the-mill tourist hotel .<ssssss>i feel that intercontinental lack the finesse whatsoever .<ssssss>judge yourself - the front desk be not able to fulfill we -lrb- advance -rrb- request for a queen or king bed room ; the front desk manager tell we that if we book the room directly -lrb- i book the room through expedia -rrb- then they would honour the request room preference .<ssssss>regardless the relationship between the hotel and expedia -lrb- i will follow up with expedia if i have time -rrb- , we arrive at 9am , get into the room at 3pm , and the front desk make no effort to accommodate we preference .<ssssss>i call the room service and ask if they could lend I scissors - they say that they do not have any scissors .<ssssss>i be speechless .<ssssss>the morning newspaper advertise on the hotel website never arrive .<ssssss>my conclusion - if you be lucky and do not need any assistance , intercontinental be a ok place to stay -lrb- provide that you can get a good deal -rrb- .<ssssss>do not expect 4-5 star service and if you pay , for one reason or another , full price for the room then you will be better off elsewhere .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 5 2 4 5		spring break at the ritz it be okay we stay 7 day at the ritz carlton for spring break ; we choose a club room after read some of the review about how expensive the food be .<ssssss>when we arrive we be face by a long line at the front office .<ssssss>we have be stay at ritz carlton hotel for year and this the first time i see such a long line at the front desk .<ssssss>i understand it be spring break but i think the ritz should have have more people at the desk to make sure the line move faster .<ssssss>we get to the room and i be very surprised how small the room be and how moderate it be .<ssssss>we pay over $ 700 a night for that i expect better .<ssssss>the room be very clean and service be good but i do not feel it be a resort hotel it be more like a business hotel .<ssssss>the beach be ok and the room have no balcony only few with balcony .<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 4 3 3 5		wall make of paperboard we stay in this hotel for five night around new year 's eve 2007/2008 .<ssssss>pro : - we book it for a rather attractive price during the holiday season -lrb- ~ eur 130 per night , incl .<ssssss>breakfast -rrb- - clean - well size room and bed for the price - good location -lrb- i can not understand why other reviewer be complain about ` safety ' ... i think it be a very nice area , close to the city center as well as the yacht port beach -rrb- - amazing breakfast , well organize even when the hotel be fully bookedcon : - we first get a room with two small bed instead of one big bed .<ssssss>after the first night we be give another room with a nice king size bed .<ssssss>- we be sometimes wonder if someone else be in we bathroom , but it be just we neighbor go to he own loo .<ssssss>i can not imagine how a newly build house can have so thin wall .<ssssss>- we room be located at the end of a corridor , close to a service room .<ssssss>so start at 7 be we could hear the maid run in and out of this room all the time .<ssssss>i be glad i have my earplug with I .<ssssss>- the heating -lrb- barcelona be not in the caribbean ! -rrb-<ssssss>stop as soon as you take out you key card to leave the room .<ssssss>so when you come back , the room will be freezing cold .<ssssss>and if you leave a second card in the slot , the maid will remove it .<ssssss>- when we want to spend a nice afternoon in the spa -lrb- eur 14 per person and day -rrb- we be warn at the spa entrance that both sauna and whirlpool be not well heat .<ssssss>so of course we abstained.we will probably not book this hotel again .<ssssss>
3 2 3 -1 4 -1 2 -1		not the best location during a recent trip to san francisco , we end up stay longer than anticipate .<ssssss>the hotel that we originally stay in be fully book for the two extra day that we need .<ssssss>so , becfore check out , i call the w , as i be a member of they special guest program.generally , i find my stay at various w hotel to be pleasant .<ssssss>i enjoy the contemporary decor and style of service of the chain.however , the w in san francisco be not one that i would return to .<ssssss>the location leave much to be desire .<ssssss>although it be accross the street from the sf museum of modern art , and be within walk distance to union square , the area have uncomfortable vibe at night .<ssssss>if walk , one have to go down either of two dimly light street to get back to the hotel .<ssssss>fortunately , there be cab there , but it do not seem as though one should have to take a cab to get a few block away because of the atmosphere by the hotel at night , when it be advertise as be a union square hotel.the room , a upgrade to a corner room , be quite small for it to be consider a ` upgrade . '<ssssss>the bathroom be fine , however .<ssssss>also , the view be quite good .<ssssss>perhaps if one be there on business and have people around they when walk about at night , it would be better .<ssssss>but , as a single woman , i would not stay there again .<ssssss>not close enough to union square to be convienent , especially at night .<ssssss>

2 2 5 5 4 4 3 4		nice but i will never go back i spend a long week-end in amsterdam staying in this hotel.it be my fault not to have check before that the hotel be a 100 % no smoking structure and client themselves could be fine of 150 euro if smoking , even inside they own rooms.that fact , even if didn ` nt affect I , as i be a no-smoker , drive my wife close to a hysterical crisis as she be use to have a cigarette when she wake up and before go to bed.even if i understand that it be my fault , still i think that it sound strange not to have care for the poor smoker in the in city of the red light district , of free drug , homosexual wedding and a long tradition of tollerance.a second problem be the the duvet be synthetic and this fact end up with a erythema.the girl at the concierge understand immediatly the reason of my problem and i have duvet change with no-synthetic ones.but , i ask , if they know that that fact can give problem , why they do not put no-synthetic duvet from the beginning.i do not think i will ever go back tho mowenpick , even if i have to say that position be fantastic and room be perfect .<ssssss>

4 5 4 3 5 2 3 5		really like city garden in hong kong we arrive at the hotel in the evening after a 13 hour flight , so we be tired but the receptionist could hardly speak english ?<ssssss>so it take more time to book in than usual .<ssssss>the reception area be really nice and spotlessly clean as be all of the hotel .<ssssss>the bar have no atmosphere and be expensive , a beer and a coffee be seven pound !<ssssss>plus they have a minimum spend policy of i believe 5 pound ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>go to the supermarket right next door for beer at about 25p a can .<ssssss>the room be really nice and clean , roomy and well decorate .<ssssss>there be suppose to be build work be do on certain floor but we do not hear they although the gym and pool area be shut due to modernisation .<ssssss>the other area be nice -lrb- restaurant , toilet , lift etc. overall a very nice stay , would reccomend the hotel to anyone .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 4 3 -1		what a let down !<ssssss>i book this hotel because of the good review it have on this sight and i end up extremley dissapointed !!<ssssss>yes the location be very good and yes the staff be friendly -lrb- which you should expect at a hotel anyway ! -rrb-<ssssss>, but the hotel be not anything special .<ssssss>i have do my research before we arrive and i be expect a small room and steep staircase .<ssssss>but the room be not just small they be tiny .<ssssss>we have a room at the back of the hotel and you could actually stretch you arm out and touch the wall on each side .<ssssss>the bathroom be even smaller .<ssssss>i dont consider myself to be fussy but these room should not be commission by the hotel as they be unbearable .<ssssss>i would have struggle to feel comfortable if i have stay in the room alone because of the size , but with my boyfriend in there too we be constantly bump into eachother .<ssssss>we couldnt be move as the hotel be fully book .<ssssss>we catch a glimpse of room at the front of the hotel when the maid be clean and they look much bigger and much more comfortable so maby we be very unlucky .<ssssss>advice for future guest avoid room 316 .<ssssss>also a horrible smell keep waft from the bathroom , like sewage / drain .<ssssss>it be like we could smell poo come from the toilet when it have not be use !<ssssss>not very nice .<ssssss>i would not say that the hotel be particulaly clean either , the bin in we room be still full with the last guest rubbish when we arrive and the sheet look as through they have be use since the 1970 's .<ssssss>the hotel smell a bit musty , it be not filthy but i think the standard could be improve .<ssssss>i would not reccommend this hotel , and i would not go again .<ssssss>amsterdam on the other hand be brilliant and we will return .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 3 2 2 1		too much ambiance and not enough class we arrive in the dominican on january 3rd for a 7 day all inclusive at the riu palace .<ssssss>as soon as we check into we room we want to come home , i be 5 and a half month pregnant and we bring we one year old daughter with we .<ssssss>i should mention weâre 32 and 33 year of age .<ssssss>my husband and i be a little put off by the restaurant reservation , because you need to make one and you need to stand in the one line to get a reservation at one of the 6 restaurant that be only open for dinner .<ssssss>there be only one restaurant for breakfast and itâs buffet and only one for lunch thatâs open from noon to 3pm .<ssssss>which be fine .<ssssss>the food be not gourmet by any stretch ; however , i find it clean at the buffet and decent .<ssssss>i didnât get sick once , however , i only eat at the italian restaurant once and it be mediocre at best and have only 5 main course , we eat at the buffet the rest of we stay .<ssssss>the restaurant reservation weâre at 6:30 or 8:30 pm , you couldnât get a 7pm reservation , there be two seating at eat restaurant and two only.the buffet be decent , my husband do get a little stomach upset on day 3 and it last for most of the trip , however , i stay away from most of the fruit unless i peel it myself and didnât eat a lot of the meat and no fish at all .<ssssss>where as he eat all of it .<ssssss>room service be decent , we only eat the club house sandwich , and itâs cold when it get to you room but it be ok .<ssssss>the 24/7 all inclusive be three fridge in the smoky sport bar that have hot dog , hamburger and grilled cheese sandwich you would heat up in the microwave in the bar and there be little container of fresh fruit.the hotel itself be beautiful , granite and marble , however you 45 minute bus ride through all the poverty be a little upset for I anyways .<ssssss>the road be terrible and pot hole be bigger than small car , so the bus have to slow to almost a stop to get over them.the pool be lovely , really , really busy but beautiful , you have to go down however at about 8 be to reserve a sunchair or you wonât get one , everyone go down and get they chair reserve and then go for breakfast or spaâs or works-out , half the time you go to notice that chair have stuff on they but you wonât see people all day .<ssssss>the beach be pack as well as people do the same thing and sometimes , reserve poolside and beach so they have chair to go back and forth too , i find this a bit annoying.it be very busy and i didnât feel that it be too relaxing there .<ssssss>the staffâs english be not great , however , if you tip well as we do at the pool and keep go back to the same spot you get pretty good service .<ssssss>there be no shopping at all , unless you want to buy a ton of knock off designer handbag and shoes.there isnât really any place to walk , the only street be caribean street and that connect all the riu hotel , the beach be busy and i find that be the only place you could walk up and down.i also feel a bit trapped , like i be on a cruise ship , as you canât leave the resort and with small child i wouldnât have .<ssssss>unless you just drink in the pool thatâs really all there be to do .<ssssss>i think when iâm older and donât have the energy to go anymore this would be the place for I .<ssssss>but after 3 day i have plenty of this vacation.all in all i didnât find it for family , and the food be mediocre and the service be mediocre and i wouldnât go back.also there be a smell to you room and when you come home you stuff smell like mold and it take a bit to get out , my daughter stroller be leave outside for three day when we come home and it still smell i have to take it apart and be the component , when you there you donât really notice the smell , but itâs 79 % humidity so you canât really escape the musty odour .<ssssss>
1 2 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		not so good we just come back from we 2 week honeymoon in italy .<ssssss>stay in hotel alessandra in florence for 3 night and be very disappointed with we stay .<ssssss>pro : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the room we have be large compare to european standard and the ceiling be very high .<ssssss>the bathroom be also very spacious - the biggest one of the 5 hotel visit during we trip .<ssssss>-lrb- 2 -rrb- the location be great and within a 5 min walk of the uffizi gallery and the ponte vecchio bridge .<ssssss>con : -lrb- 1 -rrb- warning if you have big suitcase : you must first go up a flight of stair -lrb- equivalent to the u.s. 2nd floor -rrb- in order to get to the elevator once you get to the elevator it be tiny .<ssssss>it be so small that i have to go up with my luggage first and then send the elevator down for my husband and he luggage .<ssssss>-lrb- 2 -rrb- the front door to the building be lock and you do not get a key .<ssssss>so you have to buzz in , in order to get into the building .<ssssss>-lrb- 3 -rrb- rule : you have to turn the key in to the front office everytime you leave .<ssssss>because of this , there be a curfew of 1am .<ssssss>so in other word , if you like come in and out as you please , which you do when you be site see , its very disturbing to have to go to the front desk all the time to drop off and get the key .<ssssss>also , if you want to stay out late , now you have this teenager curfew in the back of you mind .<ssssss>we ask what would happen if we come back after 1 , and he confirm that there be no one at the front desk , but the night attendant sleep at the hotel so you will just be wake he up .<ssssss>one night we come back at around midnight and be buzz to open the front door for about 10 minute before be hear .<ssssss>we think we would have to camp out .<ssssss>-lrb- 4 -rrb- the wall be paper thin .<ssssss>every morning we would hear everything from the plate and silverware in the breakfast room be prepare and or pick up , attendant clean the room next to we , the elevator door slamming , room door open and close .<ssssss>it be just horrible.we would defintely not stay here again .<ssssss>
1 -1 3 4 4 2 1 -1		terrible service for a westin my husband and i be regular westin customer , and usually experience great service .<ssssss>unfortunately , the service at this hotel be not up to the standard of other property .<ssssss>my 65-year old mom be stay in the hotel while visit I recently , and slip in the shower .<ssssss>like many newer hotel , they have forgo the rubber mat in the tub for aesthetic reason .<ssssss>she hit she head on the tile wall , and a have a huge cut that end up require 18 stitch .<ssssss>at first , she call down to the front desk , but nobody pick up , even after she let it ring for a long time .<ssssss>she then call I , so that i could take she to the emergency room .<ssssss>at the same time , my husband call the westin from we home to request that security go to the room and wait with she until i get there .<ssssss>it take I 15 minute to get dress and drive to the hotel to pick she up , and i get to she room before the security guard .<ssssss>thank god she injury be not life-threatening .<ssssss>in addition , it take the hotel 2 full day to contact my mom to see how she be do after she fall , even after we speak to one of the manager .<ssssss>obviously , this be a unique situation , but if the level of service be this bad in a emergency , can you imagine what it will be like for something without the urgency , like a request for new towel ?<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 2 3 1 -1		great location , unfriendly staff !<ssssss>my fiance and i love new york .<ssssss>it be a amazing city .<ssssss>we book the hotel metro as a extra holiday for this year so be on a bit of a budget .<ssssss>the hotel be good value for it be location but , trust I , you get what you pay for!the hotel be not so bad itself but the staff be very unhelpful and even borderline rude at time !<ssssss>i do not know what be eat they but it get to the stage where i could not be bother to ask they anything !<ssssss>there be no heating in we room and they keep say they would fix it but it never happen !<ssssss>bare in mind it be the big freeze when we went.....-10 !!<ssssss>the room be not bad and they be quite big for new york .<ssssss>we have no street noise which we always expect from new york .<ssssss>it be a nice quiet , comfortable room in fainess .<ssssss>the bathroom could do with update .<ssssss>the location be brilliant !<ssssss>it be very easy to get around as the subway in just at the end of the block as well as macy 's !<ssssss>overall , we get what we pay for but the staff could have be more friendly !<ssssss>we would not stay here again or make the mistake of go budget when we go back to new york .<ssssss>i must admit i be the sort of person who like to stay in a nice hotel , even if i be not go to be in it that much .<ssssss>if you be the sort of person who do not mind then it be perfect .<ssssss>i could not help think ... for another Â£200 we could have stay at the waldorf again .<ssssss>i wish we have pay it as it would have make we holiday another perfect one in new york .<ssssss>
3 4 2 5 3 4 3 -1		well situate , good budget hotel !<ssssss>we arrive and find the hotel with no problem , just a couple of minute walk from the vibrant las ramblas -lrb- get off at liceu metro stop -rrb- .<ssssss>we be pleasantly surprise after read some review on this website which be sometimes negative .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful .<ssssss>the hotel have some great feature , especially the atrium in the centre .<ssssss>you could see some history here , unlike many modern hotel .<ssssss>the room be basic but be ok for we as we be young traveller and be hardly ever in .<ssssss>you do not need luxury when the whole of the city be on you doorstep .<ssssss>i would ask for a room with a balcony or window if you do not mind a bit of noise at night -lrb- ours do not have a window so we could not tell what the weather be like ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>if you be travel on a shoestring , we would recommend that you go further into town for food and drink , as la rambla be very pricey .<ssssss>across the road a few block down be placa reial -lrb- sp ? -rrb-<ssssss>which have some great bar with nice food and drink and brilliant atmosphere without the huge pricetag .<ssssss>there be also a supermarket on la rambla where you can buy cheap food to take to a picnic when you be save the penny .<ssssss>get the tube to parc de la citudella -lrb- arc de triomp stop -rrb- .<ssssss>enjoy and keep a eye on you bag/camera as pickpocket be apparently rife in that area .<ssssss>the tarrif at the hotel be Â£50 for a double room so bear in mind if book with travel agent as we pay nearly Â£70 .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 1 4 4 3		people with bandage and not clean enough i have read the other review and agree with the statement about convenience and the friendliness of the staff .<ssssss>however , i would trade a friendly staff for a very clean room .<ssssss>there be dry food on the kitchen counter , smudge , stain rug , and worst be some blood near the bathroom on the wall .<ssssss>there be a lot of people recouperate from surgery here as there be a ear , nose , and throat hospital directly across the street .<ssssss>my kid do not like see people with black eye and bandage .<ssssss>i be bother by the smell - a sort of sick hospital smell cover by a windex smell .<ssssss>the staff be so incredibly nice and try they hardest to make everything acceptable .<ssssss>it be the nicest staff i have encounter in a long time .<ssssss>but it be not enough to make up for the unfresh feeling .<ssssss>it be slightly nauseating .<ssssss>we stay because the bed seem fresh and clean and that be the most important .<ssssss>plus , we be rarely in we room .<ssssss>if you have a high standard of cleanliness and do not want to feel nauseous sometimes then pay the extra money and stay somewhere else .<ssssss>but it be very hard to find a hotel with this much space and a kitchen in a quiet location - these be thing to consider .<ssssss>you could do what i do and buy a bottle of clorox cleaner and clean everything really well yourself .<ssssss>then look the other way when go through the lobby so as to avoid the black eye and bandage .<ssssss>this would not be a good place for a romantic getaway without the kid - if that be you purpose - look elsewhere .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 4 3 2		good value we pick the pk as part of we vacation package and the price be reasonable .<ssssss>we stay in the north tower and could see the royal hawaiian hotel from we lanai and a bit of a ocean view .<ssssss>the room be very basic - two queen bed , one chair and a desk with the tv .<ssssss>we be a bit crowded because we also have my 19 month old son 's travel playpen with we that be set up between the slider to the lanai and the bed .<ssssss>the furniture itself be old , outdated and in need of replace .<ssssss>the bed , however , be very nice .<ssssss>upgrade linen and very comfortable.we do not eat at any of the hotel restaurant because it be kind of pricey .<ssssss>we do sit out and listen to the entertainment by the pool one night and have a few drink .<ssssss>nice atmosphere .<ssssss>can not beat the weather in may.the tower we stay in only offer dial-up internet connection and it be spotty .<ssssss>the in-room safe do say there be a daily charge for use , but we call the front desk to ask because literature in the room say the safe be available free of charge .<ssssss>the front desk say they do not charge anymore , it be a old sign , but we double check at the end of we stay and there be not a charge , so we be pleased.other than that , the hotel be perfect for we stay and meet we expectation .<ssssss>the location , of course , be beautiful and exactly how mention in many of the review here .<ssssss>we have no problem here and would stay again !<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 3 -1 4 -1		excellent bargain for the cost -lrb- $ 65/night -rrb- , this place be excellent .<ssssss>we have a very clean room , somehow , in contrast to some other recent post .<ssssss>the free internet and free continental breakfast add to the value .<ssssss>and the surround neighbourhood be great , although a little out of the way for the major attraction -lrb- maybe a 25 minute walk to the fisherman 's wharf area -rrb- .<ssssss>we spend a couple night at the $ 200/night hilton by union square after leave the marina inn , and i end up feeling that we would have be better off stay where we be , regardless of cost .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1		wonderful stay at catalonia royal !<ssssss>my husband and i stay from july 5 , 2008 til july 11th .<ssssss>we have a wonderful stay .<ssssss>after read some review i be a little apprehensive , but you vacation be what you make it , and we make the best of everything .<ssssss>we enjoy realx at the beach , never have any trouble find chair or shade .<ssssss>we also spend time at the pool which we enjoy especially the swim up bar.our room be great , always clean and the refrigerator well stock .<ssssss>we do have a little problem with no hot water in the shower , but the problem be quickly fix after i report it , the shower hose have a problem.our favorite restaurant be the japanese , we actually eat there twice .<ssssss>my least favorite be the italian , i think because of my choice nothing else .<ssssss>we eat at the rodeo steak house and the mexican and enjoy these also .<ssssss>we have breakfast at the gran caribe several time and this be great.we do do a excursion with bavaro runner , papatony be we tour guide and he make it a lot of fun .<ssssss>i would reccomend this trip.it be well worth stay on the royal side and take advantage of the activity on the catalonia side , that side be usually more active , but then you come back to the quiet of the royal side .<ssssss>have fun talk to jose , dominique and bassilo at the lobby bar at the royal.overall a very relaxing fun vacation .<ssssss>i would definitely reccomend this hotel and look forward to go back one day .<ssssss>
3 5 3 4 4 5 3 3		cheap n cheerful !<ssssss>have read the review before i go i be anticipate the worse and hope for slightly better .<ssssss>i be never expect luxury in the first place , consider the price pay , and really just want somewhere to use as a base whilst explore the site of barcelona by day and the bar by night !<ssssss>firstly the position of the hotel be great , literally a few step to the nearest metro , on the main bus route to site such as the gaudi park etc and walk distance to rambla and the port .<ssssss>the trade off i guess be that it be on a busy road - but that mean it be good for people watch from the street cafe!secondly the staff be friendly and helpful - both reception staff and cleaners.thirdly , the room be clean and a good size .<ssssss>the view be not great from the balcony -lrb- just the back of another building -rrb- but i be not plan on sit on it for long with so much else to do .<ssssss>the bed be comfy and the aircon work well .<ssssss>the shower be brilliant - always plenty of hot water and powerful spray .<ssssss>it be clean daily and the towel be change regularly .<ssssss>the fact that we have to cross the car park to get to it be no problem as the area be only small and well light at night .<ssssss>the only problem we have , and there be always go to be a few niggle , be that where the hallway be tile you could hear every flip flop step when you neighbour come and go from they room .<ssssss>also the lift be a bit temperamental - sometimes they do not want to open the door until you would go up and down a few time , but we find that if we help the internal door to shut properly then they be fine .<ssssss>all in all i would say this be a excellent value for money hotel that be suitable if you be only look for somewhere as a pit stop , be on a budget and be not daft enough to expect miracle .<ssssss>

anywhere in this place .<ssssss>they only use fan .<ssssss>then we head to we tour bus pick out by liberty travel and wait for all the passenger to find they smash luggage and board the bus .<ssssss>.<ssssss>they tell we it be a hour long trip to the resort .<ssssss>but for the small amount of mile you be travel if they acutally build road for you to drive on , it would only take 15 -20 min .<ssssss>my trip to the resort take 3 hour b/c we bus break down .<ssssss>it be very scary drive through break , dirt road with poor people sit on the side of they .<ssssss>some local people walk along the road with huge knife in they hand .<ssssss>you dont feel safe at all .<ssssss>anything could have happen .<ssssss>the next bus come to pick we up and finish the trip .<ssssss>the 2nd driver drive very reckless hit tree and fence and almost other vehicle .<ssssss>we get a flat tire on the 2nd bus and we roll slowly the remainder of the way .<ssssss>when we arrive at dream we find out that the dream package we be suppose to have wasnt set up .<ssssss>that be the travel agent fault .<ssssss>but they say we would get we extra stuff include in the package .<ssssss>then they bring we to we honeymoon suite in building 8 .<ssssss>there be nothing special in it like we concierge say he would take care of .<ssssss>like everyone else complain the room be so hot .<ssssss>the air conditioner be control so they cant be too cold or strong enough .<ssssss>i also notice little ant on the sink and vanity .<ssssss>i call to complain .<ssssss>right away someone come to fix the air condiitioner .<ssssss>i watch a man take apart the ceiling and drop it on the floor .<ssssss>i guess he restart it or do something to make it cooler and a little stronger .<ssssss>then he put the ceiling back together .<ssssss>right there i know how this trip be go to be .<ssssss>this be not a five star resort .<ssssss>more like a 2 star .<ssssss>the air be better but not like you have it at home or any other 5 star resort .<ssssss>they do give I the champagne and fruit basket , robe , etc later on but at that point i wasnt feeling happy to celebrate .<ssssss>i make my mom call the travel agent for I and explain what happend b/c the phone in the room be expensive .<ssssss>inna the travel agent do nothing say i be a liar , what package ?<ssssss>, its not she fault and i guess never tell the manager of liberty to call I .<ssssss>i try to make the best of it wait for the manager to call I .<ssssss>the pool be full of kid jump n scream everywhere .<ssssss>if you want a chair by the pool , wake up at 7am and put you towel out to save they .<ssssss>dont even think about a float mat for the pool , there be only 20 for the whole resort .<ssssss>you have to fight people for they when they be not use they .<ssssss>they just hide they under they chair .<ssssss>the beach be full of seaweed and rock .<ssssss>not like the picture they show .<ssssss>that be what i book my trip for a beautiful beach .<ssssss>the food be terrible .<ssssss>im from ny we have some of the best resturant in the world and this not what we expect for a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>long wait time to eat .<ssssss>very under staff .<ssssss>food make I sick .<ssssss>we eat at the french resturant and we order cheese cake and chocolate mousse .<ssssss>the cheese cake look like a english muffin and the mousse taste like cardboard .<ssssss>the buffet for breakfast in the world cafe be ok but make I sick too .<ssssss>and no i never drink the water .<ssssss>room service be just scary .<ssssss>id rather have mcdonald .<ssssss>that night we have dinner on the beach in pitch darkness and that be the only somewhat edible food we have .<ssssss>by the third night the ant problem be bad .<ssssss>the ant have go everywhere .<ssssss>they be crawl out of my clothes that be in the closet , on the night stand and phone when i pick it up to complain .<ssssss>we be disgust .<ssssss>it be too late to switch resort so we change room , at 12:00 am .<ssssss>now we be in honeymoon suite , building 7 which be the same .<ssssss>very hot and have the same ant or whatever bug they be .<ssssss>this room didnt even have a remote .<ssssss>we just go to bed with the smell of bug spray and wait for morning .<ssssss>the next morning i get the manager of liberty travel on the phone .<ssssss>i tell she we either want to come home or switch resort .<ssssss>i mention the excellence which be 10 min away .<ssssss>i check we out .<ssssss>we get in a cab and go to excellence resort .<ssssss>my travel agent didnt want to pay to ugrade I there even after everthe i go through b/c of where they send I .<ssssss>the concierge see i be very upset and give I a excellence club suite without the perk of have the card but atleast it be something .<ssssss>the beach be beautiful here .<ssssss>the staff be very nice , speak english and always try to make you have fun.the food and drink be much better here .<ssssss>the spa wasnt great though , very hot no air conditioner .<ssssss>the place over all more for couple , no kid .<ssssss>there be still a few ant i saw in the sink only but i think this problem be just everywhere in the dominican rep. they be in the spa , lobby , airport everywhere .<ssssss>my bf get very sick the last 2 day of the trip .<ssssss>he stomach be really bad .<ssssss>i give he immodium but he couldnt leave the room .<ssssss>he be even sick for a few day when we get back home and have to call out sick from work .<ssssss>i have stay at excellence in rivera maya , mexico and it be great .<ssssss>not one problem .<ssssss>so i think it be just dom .<ssssss>rep. punta cana .<ssssss>i will never ever go back there .<ssssss>i will also never stay at a dream resort anywhere in the world .<ssssss>my trip cost I 3,500 , plus a huge phone bill for turn on long distance for my cell phone so i could call home and the travel agent , phone card do not work there .<ssssss>$ 15.00 on another cab ride to switch hotel , $ 20.00 just to enter punta cana that no one tell you about , and a new luggage b/c i feel like the one i take be infested with ant and i dont want it in my house .<ssssss>i also have to dry clean and wash every item clothing i bring b/c of the fear of bug .<ssssss>dry cleaning cost I over $ 100 on thing i have clean to wear there , that i didnt even put on .<ssssss>that be too much money too spend to go to a third world counrty .<ssssss>its too much of a hassle for a vacation that suppose to be a 5 star resort .<ssssss>more like a african safari , not a luxury vacation .<ssssss>i have never have anything like this happen to I .<ssssss>my advice , dont go to punta cana , or if you do pay with you amex card so you can try and get you money back .<ssssss>
1 1 3 4 3 1 3 2		nice resort ; but the service be terrible if you be look for a relaxing time and a hassle free check in this be not the resort for you .<ssssss>i travel to san juan on july 27 thru july31st with friend .<ssssss>when we first drive up we be so excited to see this beautiful hotel , but during check in we be tell many different thing from a 10 % resort fee plus a $ 200 deposit on a credit card and that you have to pay you whole bill up front .<ssssss>i have stay at several marriottâs and never have to pay up front .<ssssss>the front desk clerk ramon be very nice and try he best to help but need to get a manager .<ssssss>the manager christian be not accommodate at all be very smug .<ssssss>i have be a customer service manager for over 10 year and know that there be always a way to please a customer especially when they be spend $ 225 a night .<ssssss>needless to say the manager be not willing to accommodate we so we pay for one night and the next day go to the condado plaza and believe I the service be excellent and the room be hip and contemporary .<ssssss>in close if you want a place where they do not value the customer this be you resort !<ssssss>

5 5 5 4 5 3 3 5		a absolulte bargain we book this hotel two day in advance as we be stay on the coast in salou and fancy a night in barcelona .<ssssss>and what a bargain - Â£52 for a extremely clean , bright , spacious and well ventilate room.the location be good too especially give the price - a stone 's throw from the gran via and around 20 min walk from las ramblas .<ssssss>it be also right next to a couple of metro station if you do not fancy the walk.don ' t be put off by the 3 star rating - this be more like a 4 star but without the facility such as swim pool etc.would definitley stay in this hotel again .<ssssss>
4 5 5 -1 4 -1 3 -1		memorial weekend stay we stay at the michelangelo for the memorial weekend .<ssssss>the room be clean , unbelievable in how much space for a manhattan hotel .<ssssss>the location great for easy access to broadway , the park , time square .<ssssss>doorman and desk staff be responsive when approach , but not particularly helpful in general .<ssssss>would have be neutral to ok for regular rack rate , but for the package/discount rate it be a excellent experience .<ssssss>breakfast coffee service in the lobby be comfortable .<ssssss>
1 3 1 -1 3 -1 1 -1		just awful the hotel be place in the worst possible area of sanfrancisco .<ssssss>homeless people and gang everywhere , i feel quite threatened.the room have no hot water .<ssssss>we complain about it several time but unfortunately be never fixed.it be incredibly noisy .<ssssss>people be come into the hotel at 3am after party .<ssssss>we report this to the front desk , and they do not care about it.i have no sleep , no shower .<ssssss>we be pay for three night , but leave after the second , exhaust and desperate for a shower .<ssssss>would never stay there again and certainly would not recommend the hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 4 4 4 2 2 4		great facility - but service lacklustre good thing about this property - unlike most of the luxury hotel in nyc , the facility be new , and the room be not tire .<ssssss>because of the location of the hotel , the entire hotel be quiet - no real street noise .<ssssss>bathroom be great.bad thing - it be very expensive , and the service be simply not up to snuff for the type of property it pretend to be .<ssssss>get ready for clumsy checkin , botch reservation -lrb- in the hotel 's own restaurant ? -rrb-<ssssss>and generally blah service -lrb- even worse that what you would normally expect for high end nyc hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>i have now stay here a few time , and on each occasion , the experience have be the same .<ssssss>so , caveat emptor - you will pay dearly for a beautiful room , but if you be expect service commensurate with the facility , you will be disappointed - for that , try the fs instead .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 2 -1 4 -1		not worth it stay in december , 2003 for the honolulu marathon .<ssssss>the room leave much to be desire .<ssssss>it be small , dark , and very moldy with old peel wallpaper .<ssssss>frankly , the room feel like a dumpy motel .<ssssss>however , the beach be fantastic , and the reserved lounge chair with towel , umbrella , and food service be a nice luxury that we take advantage of daily .<ssssss>the outdoor bar at night with the music and cocktail be also wonderful .<ssssss>all-in-all i have to say that for the cost of a luxury resort , i expect my room to be acceptable .<ssssss>i would not stay again .<ssssss>
3 4 3 5 2 4 3 -1		this be the place we stay in hollywood my family have stay at the orchid on several occasion , and we be very satisfied with it .<ssssss>it be not a fancy place , but it have a great location if you want to stay in hollywood at a reasonable price.on we recent stay last week , we have a junior room , which have two double bed and a kitchenette .<ssssss>we find the bed a bit hard , but they be ok.we like the secure underground parking , especially in the area of hollywood and highland .<ssssss>i feel my car be safer than on a open lot.the thing we like the least be the very dirty carpet ; it turn the bottom of we foot black very quickly .<ssssss>it need to be clean desperately.would we go back ?<ssssss>yes , certainly .<ssssss>have i recommend the orchid to other ?<ssssss>yes , i have.it be not a posh or fancy place , but then again , it do not have posh or fancy price either .<ssssss>
3 5 3 -1 3 -1 2 -1		good value for the price - .<ssssss>we just come return from a two night stay at hotel beacci tornabuonus , and find it to be a mixed bag .<ssssss>on the positive , the hotel have a fantastic location , and the staff be nice .<ssssss>sit up on the rooftop be also quite lovely .<ssssss>it could have just be we room , but you have to walk up several flight -lrb- after use the elevator to go four flight to the lobby -rrb- to get to they .<ssssss>breakfast be so-so , and the room be large -lrb- a definite plus -rrb- , but nothing special .<ssssss>we get a very good rate for we two room , and so that make up for alot ...<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 2 2 5		great location but a few problem recently stay for 5 night with 2 friend for my husband 's 60th .<ssssss>we have stay before a few year ago so know the location be great , walk distance to most thing we want to see and taxi nearby when leg give out .<ssssss>however it be important to we that we have a king size bed and that casa patas -lrb- a flamenco house -rrb- have be book for a meal and the show at midnight as a birthday celebration.this be all confirm by email , so we feel quite relax about everything .<ssssss>however , the bed be definitely not a king but standard size .<ssssss>the usually silent older gentleman on reception explain that it be a spanish king size , yeah right !<ssssss>strange that the king size bed we have in barcelona be huge !<ssssss>just something to be aware of , we end up change to a twin room so that we would both get some sleep .<ssssss>also the booking have not be make but we go there the next day and the nicest waiter organise it all for we , even reserve we a table right by the stage .<ssssss>so it be fine in the end .<ssssss>in fact it be a excellent night aid by several bottle of cava .<ssssss>to be fair , the hotel have also be in touch to book for we but we want to be sure.staff a mixture of very friendly and super-surly .<ssssss>we didnât want to make lifelong friendship but it be nice just to be acknowledge when you pass through reception .<ssssss>best staff be at breakfast which be good with very nice tortilla and good selection .<ssssss>room fine , clean and not too small for a central hotel.overall would recommend and stay there again as it be just so well positioned and good value .<ssssss>we book through venere so nothing to pay until we leave .<ssssss>
3 3 3 1 3 5 4 -1		fun hotel but there must be better place to stay we choose the hotel del sol for we 5 day stay in san francisco on the basis that the review indicate it might be fun for we two boy -lrb- 9 and 17 -rrb- , that it have a pool and because it have free parking .<ssssss>in fact hotel de sol be a motel rather than a hotel and the fact that all the room overlook a central public courtyard mean that all be inherently noisy .<ssssss>fortunately during we stay the other guest be not make much noise , but i could imagine that if you be unlucky and you stay co-incide with that of a rowdy group , it could be pretty unpleasant .<ssssss>the pool be very small and not really worthwhile , and whilst on site car parking be a great bonus i think that next time i would get rid of the hire car when reach san francisco and get by use public transport .<ssssss>that say a drive out to muir wood be well worth while .<ssssss>the hotel location be not good .<ssssss>it be not near anything of interest .<ssssss>admittedly the bus stop be only two block away , but you have to use the bus to go everywhere , which be time consuming.the staff be superb .<ssssss>very friendly and extremely helpful .<ssssss>the hotel provide a light breakfast , even though it do not have the facility to do so .<ssssss>you get you bagel and coffee from reception and the sit by the pool .<ssssss>the building and room be colourful and jolly , and a big benefit for we be that the price be such that we could afford to have two room rather than have to share a room with we boy .<ssssss>on reflection though it would have be better to have find a hotel in fisherman 's wharfe -lrb- i be not sure which however as none stand out as look particularly welcome -rrb- .<ssssss>we take a night trip to alcatraz which be fantastic - one of the best tourist trip i have ever do .<ssssss>the boy also really enjoy the exploratorium -lrb- science museum -rrb- .<ssssss>people have warn my that san fracisco would be cold , but i have not really believe they .<ssssss>we leave sacramento -lrb- 80 mile inland -rrb- with the temperature at 95 f , and when we get to san francisco it be only 60 f. it stay like that all week .<ssssss>this be , however , a welcome relief from the heat we have experience during the remainder of we trip.overall , although hotel del sol be great fun , my advice would be to find a hotel in either fisherman 's wharfe or union square .<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 3 4 4 2		great location , great stay we stay at the affinia dumont for six night in november .<ssssss>after read the review on this website , we be very excite to stay at this hotel consider the price be average with other hotel in nyc.the front desk staff be very friendly and helpful when we check in .<ssssss>we didnât have a room with a stellar view , but they offer to put we in another room on a higher floor the follow morning .<ssssss>we didnât want to move room after we first night , but they willingness to accommodate we request be refreshing.our suite come with two queen size bed , a large desk and kitchen .<ssssss>the kitchen be a huge bonus !<ssssss>there be a small market store just step away from the hotel and we pick up cereal , milk , yogurt , fruit , etc. and keep all of this in the fridge .<ssssss>we manage to save a bit of money by eat breakfast in the hotel before we venture out each day .<ssssss>the kitchen come with a full size fridge , microwave , dish , small oven/stove and full size sink .<ssssss>we even bring back leftovers from dinner one night at the nearby lemongrass restaurant -lrb- great thai food -rrb- and eat it the follow evening , again save a bit of money after a long day of sightseeing.the hotel have a very large gym and spa even offer âfitness packagesâ?which be free for guest to use .<ssssss>we also have a âpillow menuâ?in we room which give approx six option of pillow that could be request through housekeeping .<ssssss>they even have a pillow that have speaker build into it to be plug in to a ipod .<ssssss>we order the swedish massage pillow and a buckwheat pillow â?great fun great perk at this hotel.a couple of negative item â?the bark dog restaurant be not good at all .<ssssss>we go there because we have read on this site that it be pretty good and affiliate with the hotel -lrb- they provide the room service -rrb- but after eat there be very disappointed .<ssssss>there be a number of restaurant , pub , etc. at the end of the block to the east of the hotel .<ssssss>just take a few more step down the block past the bark dog to other restaurant â?or even head a few step to the west to the lemongrass restaurant.internet at this hotel be also not free â?we pay $ 42 for five day which be very pricey .<ssssss>also , bottled water in the room be $ 7 per bottle .<ssssss>you be best off go to the market next door or even the drug store at the end of the block and get a few litre of water for a couple of dollars.all in all , we stay be great .<ssssss>the affinia dumont be in a wonderful location and be a very comfortable hotel .<ssssss>we would stay there again and recommend this hotel to friend and family .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 3 4 -1		great value for the money !<ssssss>well , first off i have to say that we pay $ 1000/person before tax for this trip during spring break - so everything i say be relative .<ssssss>my fiancee and i have a great time largely due to the fact that we get a great deal and be there to enjoy the sun , surf and sand not to mention the booze !<ssssss>if you have read the review on the hotel , do not get scare , it be clean , the staff be friendly and the location be fantastic.the best part of we stay be choose not to do excursion but rather to spend the money on a professional photo session .<ssssss>the on site photographer lead by george gurascier be phenomenal .<ssssss>george take we on a expedition around the grounds and along the beach and take some of the most spectacular photo i have see and i have see a lot !<ssssss>-lrb- both my fiancee and i use to be model -rrb- .<ssssss>in a hour and a half he capture close to 200 great photo that be almost impossible to choose between .<ssssss>after the session be do , he edit and compile the picture and even offer to ensure that they be print and ready for pick up before we departure the next day .<ssssss>even if you decide the full photo session be not you idea of fun , make sure you take a photo on the beach with any of the tropical animal they bring each day -lrb- monkey , iguana , parrot , boa -rrb- .<ssssss>for a few buck you will have a truly spectacular picture , that you can see the edit version before you buy - and they will edit out everyone on the beach if you want !<ssssss>take my word for it go and see these guy .<ssssss>they be located in the hotel , just next to the main pool - check out the pic i attached.ok , about the hotel ... when it come to the room , you get what you pay for !<ssssss>the hotel be recently purchase by barcelo and they be in the process of renovate .<ssssss>to date they have complete the new pool and restaurant and 3 buliding out of the seven that comprise the hotel .<ssssss>it seem that the renovate room go to the guest from europe or the we who have pay more for they trip .<ssssss>the old room go to those on package deal with air transat , skyservice etc. the room be clean but be old and in much need of repair .<ssssss>we air conditioner do not work well but when we mention it to guest service they do send someone to look at it .<ssssss>three out of the four lamp in the room do not work and the lampshade be stain and ragged .<ssssss>there be mosquito squashed on the wall and the ceiling in the bathroom have a small leak - so nothing to write home about but not the end of the world either.the maid service be not great but they do the necessary cleaning i.e. bathroom and floor but attention to detail like replace the kleenex box go out the window .<ssssss>again , we only sleep in the room and make the best of the rest of we time.the beach and pool area be beautiful , there be plenty of chair at both and despite the hotel be at full capacity , there never seem to be a crowd .<ssssss>the beach towel service be a little hit and miss , but if you keep try you will get one -lrb- keep in mind with some 1500 guest at the hotel , that be a lot of laundry!the food be reasonable at the buffet but the a la carte restaurant be better !<ssssss>it be not gourmet but there be plenty of variety and for a $ 1000 you can not expect cordon bleu cooking .<ssssss>perhaps one of the best thing about the resort be that you can get food 24/7 ... there be always a restaurant that be open .<ssssss>you best bet for lunch be at the el mirador , the new restaurant next to the new pool - it be a little long but the food be good and the view be spectacular.there 's nothing to complain about with the alcohol , the bartender be more than happy to give you more than you need , and the all inclusive price include premium alcohol not just domestic brand .<ssssss>the animation team be great but never pushy - if you want to join a activity , that be great if you do not they leave you alone.all in all a fun time , and great value for the money .<ssssss>if you can put up with a old , tired room then it be well worth see this spectacular location !!!!!<ssssss>because once they have finish renovate a $ 1000 all inclusive for a week will be a thing of the past !!!!!<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 4 -1 5 -1		terrific hotel spend the weekend in the city with some friend and get a great rate on the reaissance .<ssssss>somehow the date be mix up , and when i call to confirm they let I know and apologize get I the same rate for the day i need .<ssssss>the staff could not be friendlier or more helpful .<ssssss>the room be very nice and pretty spacious and clean .<ssssss>great view .<ssssss>prime location .<ssssss>the restaurant have a spectacular view of time square .<ssssss>the health club be great too -lrb- and totally empty -rrb- .<ssssss>highly recommend .<ssssss>i would definitely stay here again .<ssssss>i have other friend who stay at the edison and they hate it and everyone be rude .<ssssss>
5 4 5 4 5 2 4 3		contiki be incredible travel to conitki solo expect the unexpected .<ssssss>turn out awesome and i owe it all to the staff and management of contiki balus .<ssssss>excellent room , staff be fun and easy to work with , and ton of stuff to do .<ssssss>go to tiesto at club 66 and want last minute tix and the manager personally get they for I .<ssssss>from someone in the hotel industry , be very impressed !<ssssss>look forward to go back in 2008<ssssss>
3 3 4 1 4 3 4 -1		not the best location after read review on this hotel , we didnt know what to expect .<ssssss>some think the location and hotel be good , and other the opposite .<ssssss>we find the hotel to be lovely inside , and the staff friendly and helpful .<ssssss>the room be a bit small , but very nice .<ssssss>the one thing i do not like be the location .<ssssss>it be only a 10 minute walk into the centre which isnt far .<ssssss>however , its the part that you have to walk through which we do not like .<ssssss>there be no shop , restaurant etc up at this end - just building .<ssssss>there also doesnt seem to be tourist up this far either , and be pretty much just local and people on moped .<ssssss>you have to pass a big square , which have lot of young italian male all hang about .<ssssss>as i be there with my partner , i be not overly concern .<ssssss>however , i wouldnt like to stay there if i be a young female alone , or even all female in a small group .<ssssss>i think they would be safer to find accomodation more in the centre .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 4 3 2 2		dull dull dull what can i say the hotel be very very dull indeed .<ssssss>certainly not a 5 * star hotel .<ssssss>although the hotel have a great location - if all you want to do be shop .<ssssss>the hotel lack any personality at all .<ssssss>in fact i would say that the hotel be miss something - it feel cold and clinical .<ssssss>the room be very clean but basic .<ssssss>the bathroom be large and functional .<ssssss>the lack of towel -lrb- 1 per person -rrb- , change under duress .<ssssss>the only reading matter in the room be a tv guide - no where magazine or map.the front desk staff where efficient - very swiss but with little or no personality .<ssssss>as for the concierge every request be a chore .<ssssss>as we be there for a week it be a bit of a lottery which one of we ask the question - the loser have to ask.not a hotel i would return to .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 2 1 2		to be avoid the hotel have a good location and be close to attraction and shop .<ssssss>however , the room be dirty and the uncomfortable bed have bed-bug , so myself and my travel companion be both cover in bite each morning .<ssssss>i understand that this be a budget hotel but the overall experience be pretty unpleasent and there be better budget accomodation available in the city , so we would recommend look for a alternative .<ssssss>

3 4 3 5 2 3 3 3		decent value for family who want to stay on the beach spend a week here with two 16 yr old and a 7 yr old .<ssssss>we rent a two bedroom suite -lrb- 6th floor/city side -rrb- .<ssssss>everyone enjoy it .<ssssss>the location be good ... right on the beach .<ssssss>the pool be fairly large and the area be well maintain .<ssssss>there be various activity organize for the kid .<ssssss>there be plenty of store and restaurant in walk distance .<ssssss>have a great cuban dinner at el tropico just up the street .<ssssss>this stretch of miami beach be relatively quiet relative to sobe .<ssssss>it be not nearly as chic -lrb- as we teenager point out -rrb- .<ssssss>nevertheless , it be a good place to bring a family .<ssssss>we only complaint be that the rrom be a little dated .<ssssss>they be not terrible , but it certainly be not the four season .<ssssss>give the reasonable price and location on the beach , i feel it be a good value and would take the family there again .<ssssss>if i be a honeymooner , i would spring for the extra $ $ $ and stay in a posh hotel on sobe .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 4 -1 4 -1		very disappointed in room !<ssssss>i could not believe the room we have for almost $ 300.00 a night .<ssssss>it be the type of room i would expect at a budget motel .<ssssss>it be small and definitely nothing special about it .<ssssss>i guess the price be so high because the hotel be locate on the beach which be a definite plus .<ssssss>the food be very expensive .<ssssss>we only eat at the hotel the first night due to the price .<ssssss>the staff be nice .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 1 1 2		most holiday inn express be better than this holiday inn i always hit the gym for a workout even during business travel , so i always pay attention to the gym/fitness amenity and consider it a important factor when i book my hotel .<ssssss>the hotel website 's picture show the fitness room have a variety of equipment , include a multi-station weight machine .<ssssss>my experience be completely the opposite.don ' t let the million-dollar lobby fool ya , the room be horrible .<ssssss>they be date and dirty , nothing like the lobby .<ssssss>i be assign to a room where the bed be not make , the garbage can be still full and only the bathroom seem to be clean .<ssssss>after i bring this to the staff 's attention , the reluctantly give I a different room .<ssssss>this one be unvacuumed and have colorful peanut mm all over the place .<ssssss>the bathroom amenity be so cheap , the item be from different collection , and nothing match .<ssssss>shampoo from one brand , lotion from another , and soap from yet a third source that do not even have holiday inn logo.the gym be also old and dated .<ssssss>it do not have the multi-station equipment as picture and barely have a couple of half broken threadmill and a few unpaired free-weight .<ssssss>except the lobby area , the rest of the hotel give I a yucky unclean feeling .<ssssss>this be a wyndham at one point , but this holiday inn be soo cheap , they never bother to replace some signage with wyndham 's name .<ssssss>instead , they use a black marker to black out wyndham 's name .<ssssss>how tacky.overall , this be definitely not what i expect from a holiday inn , i have way better experience at holiday inn express or low-end place like comfort inn and etc. .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 5 3 -1		great service a nice hotel , very well situated , close to the trainstation and just a few minute walk away from all the main attraction .<ssssss>the hotelstaff especially be very friendly and helpfull .<ssssss>even offer to reserve ticket by phone for the main museum.rooms be nice and cool -lrb- a good thing in the italian summer -rrb-<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 5 -1 3 -1		do as little or as much as you want my husband and i actually just get back at 2am this morning from we vacation to the iberostar dom .<ssssss>i be addict to this site so i could not wait to get back and write my review .<ssssss>we take this trip from may 6-13 for we 5 year anniversary .<ssssss>we have be to the couple negril , the melia in cozumel and now this be we 3rd all inclusive , and naturally you compare the resort to eachother .<ssssss>we book we vacation thru we airway vacation -lrb- a subsidiary of funjet vacation -rrb- .<ssssss>they make everything so easy .<ssssss>once we get to the airport , of course you pretty much get stop by a hear of airport bellman i guess you could call they , so pretty much you have no choice but to give they you luggage to take you to you transfer .<ssssss>the ride to the hotel be like a game of dodgem car at the amusement park .<ssssss>it be about a 30-35 minute ride .<ssssss>check in at the hotel be easy .<ssssss>we end up in one of the junior suite without even ask , which be fine , but we end up in a room with 2 double bed .<ssssss>which be fine , we do not need to have we room change .<ssssss>its true , the bed be not very comfortable and the pillow be rather flat .<ssssss>i have 2 pillow already on the bed and then i just use one of the decoration pillow from the couch and that work fine .<ssssss>the air conditioning really do not get that cold , the room always have a damp feel to it .<ssssss>later on i find out that the light , fan , tv , and air conditioning be on a motion sensor so they turn off when you be not in the room and then they turn on again when it sens you enter the room .<ssssss>the air conditioning switch be on the headboard .<ssssss>thanks to some of the other review , i know right where to look !!<ssssss>also the slide door must be completely shut for the air to work .<ssssss>if that door be keep open , the air will not go on .<ssssss>so check you door sometimes the maid do not always make sure they be close .<ssssss>overall i would rate the room average , it be not as nice as some of the other resort we have be to but it serve the purpose for the amount of time we spend in there.we spend most of we day at thepunta cana side of the pool .<ssssss>we usually head down to the pool about 10 am and never have a problem get a chair .<ssssss>you almost have to save you chair for the day , since you be not go to carry you beach bag and towel with you wherever you go .<ssssss>the pool be always really refreshing , especially since the sun be really intense in the dr !!<ssssss>we love just sit in the wade part of the pool sip blue hawai -lrb- yummy if you like coconut drink -rrb- and margarita !!<ssssss>yes there be a bar in the steakhouse , which be the closest to the area that we be sit , and they seem to always give we the larger cup and the bartender be always the friendliest .<ssssss>its kind of a hidden treasure .<ssssss>i would definately recommend the marinarium excursion where you snorkel with the nurse shark and the sting ray , that be so much fun sharky and the crew be so awesome !!!<ssssss>... the best part be when they bring out the blender and make fresh coco loco right there on the catamaran !!!!!<ssssss>they be constantly walk around offer you fresh fruit , drink , water , and sandwich !<ssssss>then the last part of the trip be when they take you to the natural pool where the caribbean sea meet the atlantic ocean .<ssssss>the water be only waist deep and they bring you drink right there .<ssssss>they really make the trip what it be !<ssssss>worth every penny!i do not know how people can go to this resort and complain about the food .<ssssss>i think the food be wonderful !!!<ssssss>from the buffet to the al a carte ... everything be so good !!<ssssss>there be pretty much something for everyone .<ssssss>if you can not find a entree you like , then make a sandwich , there be always lunch meat and fixing , and ton of fresh bread .<ssssss>you have to go with a open mind , the food be most likely go to taste a little different than it do back home ... remember you be not eat at mcdonald !<ssssss>i will repeat the food be wonderful!the show be pretty entertaining ... and the cocktail waitress always make sure you have pleantly to drink , especially if you give they a few dollar .<ssssss>the entertainment staff work really hard and be always try to get people involve in the many many activity they have go on ... which we always decline since all we want to do be lay in the sun and do absolutely nothing!all in all we enjoy we vacation ... i do not regret stay at the iberostar at all .<ssssss>may be the start of rainy season in the dr so there be 1 day when it rain all day and then there be 2 other day when it rain for a few hour in the afternoon .<ssssss>the grounds be beautiful , very well keep , the animal that live on the resort be fun to see ... especially the peacock that would wake we up every morning cackeling as he be visit we on we balcony .<ssssss>i would not stay at this resort again only for the fact that we like to go different place every time we travel.we do not wait in a long line at all at the airport for we we airway flight , i guess the length of the line depend on which airline you use .<ssssss>everything seem to flow just fine .<ssssss>just keep in mind that everything be out in the open so it get hot when you be sit there wait for you flight.oh yes , the resort be mainly european so there be alot of topless lady and lot and lot of speedo .<ssssss>but that be entertaining in itself.enjoy you trip and relax !<ssssss>
3 3 1 4 2 2 2 -1		flood bathroom and no wash cloth the barcelo dominican beach resort be a beautiful place .<ssssss>we have a ground-floor room and love sit on the terrace .<ssssss>fortunately , we have have the foresight to take bug repellant spray , which be need in the evening .<ssssss>with three or four exception , we have a great time .<ssssss>first , we could not make the maid understand that since there be three of we , we need three towel .<ssssss>on one occasion , i even count each of we for the maid and point to a towel to emphasize that we need one for each of we .<ssssss>this be ineffective because she still leave only two towel .<ssssss>the maid there the first day be great , but she do not return until the day before we checkout .<ssssss>then we finally receive three towel .<ssssss>second , in a attempt to get wash cloth , i finally ask wendy at guest service if people in the dominican republic do not use wash cloth because we could not get the maid to leave any -- not one .<ssssss>wendy assure we we would be give wash cloth .<ssssss>she assurance mean absolutely nothing .<ssssss>we do not receive wash cloth until the first maid return the day before we check out .<ssssss>she leave three wash cloth .<ssssss>hallelujah !<ssssss>we have be use hand towel or a end of we give towel for wash cloth .<ssssss>the major problem , however , be that the toilet leak , the ceiling leak , and water pour out from under the wall -- all flood we bathroom .<ssssss>we have to place the bathmat next to the wall to absorb water .<ssssss>once we have to use one of we two towel , which be disastrous because by then we consider towel to be sacred .<ssssss>at that point i do persuade wendy to send we a replacement towel for that one .<ssssss>as far as the food go , there be a great variety from which to choose .<ssssss>i love try the various dish even if i spend lot and lot of time in the flood bathroom from do so .<ssssss>-lrb- whoever in a previous review say to take imodium and pepto bismol be not kid . -rrb-<ssssss>the a la carte restaurant offer good food , too -lrb- unfortunately , with the same effect as the food on the buffet -rrb- .<ssssss>mthe male waiter be very friendly ; the female ignore people.the christmas eve dinner invitation -lrb- which be slide under the room door -rrb- add a festive touch .<ssssss>the buffet area be beautifully decorate in what must have be a dominican republic tradition .<ssssss>the dolphin ice sculpture be lovely .<ssssss>it seem as if every kind of food imaginable be offer christmas eve .<ssssss>we love the cafe .<ssssss>we end up there quite often for espresso or latte or some frozen coffee concoction and dessert , all of which be delicious .<ssssss>the worker there be terrific .<ssssss>they be friendly , they dramatically sing along to the music be play , they pose for picture .<ssssss>we thoroughly enjoy time spend in the cafe .<ssssss>administrator of the casino should learn that people would spend a lot more money at the blackjack table if the dealer be friendly .<ssssss>they talk to other employee and do not even look at we while we play .<ssssss>one of they ignore my confirm i want even money for my blackjack .<ssssss>the dealer be rude and do not give player a chance to ask for another card .<ssssss>they just do they thing with no regard to the player .<ssssss>i definitely would not recommend the casino to anyone.one of the entertainment staff -lrb- richard -rrb- look like will smith .<ssssss>he do a great job and so do the other .<ssssss>in the lobby lounge , entertainer ask guest to dance , which be fun .<ssssss>we go to a couple show at the theatre , and they be entertaining .<ssssss>after one , will tell everyone to go to the beach for a party there .<ssssss>we follow everyone , and the dj and bartender there be great .<ssssss>they all put on quite a show .<ssssss>drink be abundant and good .<ssssss>bartender be friendly and entertaining .<ssssss>check-in take about a half hour because a room be not ready .<ssssss>the maid take they time and seem to do one thing in the room , leave for a while , come back and do another thing , leave , come back .<ssssss>i think the last thing they do be bring the two towel .<ssssss>no wash cloth , just two towel .<ssssss>walk up the beach to the little shop be a experience .<ssssss>the vendor in the first shop closest to the ocean be very nasty because we do not buy from he right then .<ssssss>i go back in to ask about something after we have visit other shop , and he scream and act like a mad man because he say we buy from other .<ssssss>i do advise people to stay away from that shop .<ssssss>we walk by the next day and he start scream and yell again .<ssssss>a couple day later my 6 ' 5 , 300 + or - pound son accompany we , and the man keep he mouth shut .<ssssss>we find this funny because my son simply want to see in the shop , but this man must have be afraid .<ssssss>he be all mouth when it be only two woman , but quite quiet when a large male be with we .<ssssss>we find the taxi driver very nice , too .<ssssss>they be quite helpful with luggage and with take we wherever we want to go .<ssssss>rate be fair .<ssssss>overall , we have a good time .<ssssss>for the money , with the exception of the bathroom problem , the place be pretty nice .<ssssss>we would , however , not go back -lrb- unless we win a all-expenses-paid trip -rrb- .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 4 5		much nicer now its be renovate hong kong be not my kind of place .<ssssss>you either love it or hate it .<ssssss>i hate it .<ssssss>i have only vist twice in 6 year and on both occasion i stay at this hotel .<ssssss>the first visit be nothing to write home about but after the recent renovation , the room be very chic , almost sexy .<ssssss>i still find it annoying that they put guest in a smoker room without ask .<ssssss>and equally annoying that they give you a room with no view when in fact they have several with view .<ssssss>be they try not to impress you ?<ssssss>after ask for a non-smoking room one preferably with a view , i be give one .<ssssss>so what be they think at reception ?<ssssss>very silly .<ssssss>breakast also start very late - too late for business traveller .<ssssss>dinner be very pleasant in the chinese restaurant on the top floor ... even with a step into the restaurant that have most patron trip on it .<ssssss>the staff make you aware of it , in which case why not light it accordingly and save you patron from embarrassment .<ssssss>the bar , also on the top floor , have superb view .<ssssss>not sure this be the best place to stay in hong kong , as i have not stay anywhere else but have say that it be without question a luxury hotel with 5 star service and few but silly fault .<ssssss>
3 4 4 3 4 4 1 3		less than impressed we be in fajardo for approximately 4 day .<ssssss>certainly , there be a lot to do in this area .<ssssss>the hotel be central enough to be able to do all these activity , although keep in mind , although they advertise that they be close to the beach , they certainly be not .<ssssss>you require a car at all time to get around - beach , sightseeing , restaurants.the room be clean and satisfactory .<ssssss>the restaurant be also good .<ssssss>its menu be varied and reasonably price for the level we go to .<ssssss>however , we be repulse , though , by the attitude by the barman .<ssssss>we sit ourselves at the bar , for about 15 minute .<ssssss>there may have be 4 other people in the entire bar .<ssssss>we be completely ignore despite multiple attempt to make eye contact .<ssssss>other be be serve the minute they come up to the bar .<ssssss>when we finally open we mouth , and attempt to order a very simple drink , we be advise that they could not facilitate that .<ssssss>certainly , it prompt both of we to leave expeditiously , and never return .<ssssss>we refuse to pay money in a place that would treat we with anything but respect .<ssssss>the manager of this bar and the hotel should be advise that such behavior be unacceptable.would we stay at fajardo inn again - probably not .<ssssss>there be a few such episode with the staff .<ssssss>unfortunately they seem to have a monopoly in that area as the only other reputable place be el conquistador - which , after speak to a variety of other tourist , be less than impressed with they expensive stay there .<ssssss>
2 4 1 -1 1 -1 3 -1		great breakfast , great rate , room could be better this hotel have a lot go for it .<ssssss>in a city like frankfurt , it offer good nightly rate , and the free and plentiful breakfast be very welcome .<ssssss>the location , less than 5 minute ' walk from the hauptbahnhof main train station , be also excellent for those come from other city in germany or the eu , or from frankfurt airport.however ... the room be not up to scratch .<ssssss>when we stay there , the room we be give be not very clean .<ssssss>the shower have a mechanical bit which have fall onto the floor .<ssssss>and we have to report this twice before anything be do about it .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 2 4 3 2		take the bitter with the better ... .<ssssss>stay at the sheraton while in bean town on business .<ssssss>i have spend some downtime in the lobby previously and be impress with the decor , business amenity and the big starbuck .<ssssss>this time tho i stay as a pay guest of the hotel - and tho the lobby be still a beauty - this hotel definitely have problem .<ssssss>to begin with - $ 41 per nite come and go as you please valet parking .<ssssss>that my friend be a shakedown .<ssssss>next - once you ride the elevator up from that beautiful lobby - the hotel proper be less than appeal .<ssssss>my room be on the 24th floor and the carpet in the hallway be outdate and dirty look .<ssssss>the door to the room be scratch up and in poor condition .<ssssss>the room itself be of decent size with perhaps the best view i have have at a city hotel in year - look out over the river and to my left i could see the dreaded fenway - just a amazing view .<ssssss>but , the room feel not dirty - but almost dirty .<ssssss>the carpet be old and like in the hallway - do not seem clean .<ssssss>as i walk barefoot in the room , i be a bit turn off to the feel .<ssssss>the tv be some 1990 's tube with a horrible picture and relatively little channel choice .<ssssss>where be the flat panel .<ssssss>even worse , the in-room internet be wire - not wifi .<ssssss>do i take a trip back to the 90 's ?<ssssss>no wi-fi and no flat panel = no future visit from this road warrior business traveler .<ssssss>ps - breakfast buffet of high quality but why leave a usa today at my doorstep - i do not want that bogus broadsheet .<ssssss>
2 3 4 1 5 2 3 2		a bit too far out ... the hotel be not bad , clean and well maintain .<ssssss>bedroom be on the small side and as the bed be quite large it feel a little bit claustrophobic .<ssssss>extra such as breakfast and laundry be expensive .<ssssss>the staff seem not bother most of the time and i often have to grab someone attention even though i be the only person standing at the counter !<ssssss>however , my biggest gripe be the distance from the centre of barcelona .<ssssss>despite previous comment i find the journey arduous .<ssssss>the metro be quite close but it be still a 20 minute ride to cataluyna station .<ssssss>it be sometimes hard to get taxi in the evening , particularly from 8 o'clock onward and cost about 12 euro to get to the city .<ssssss>however barcelona can be difficult to get a taxi from in the early hour and i spend over a hour try to hail a cab one night wish my hotel be more central.the princess be not a bad hotel and the beach around teh corner be great however i would highly recommend stay more central .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 2 2 3 5		great location , otherwise very mediocre i stay here for 3 night from 3/24 -3 / 27 for a conference .<ssssss>the hotel be in a very good location , squarely situate in the french quarter .<ssssss>it be one block west of bourbon street , and 1 block north of canal street .<ssssss>jackson square and harrah 's casino be approximately5-10 minute walk away , and the conference center be about a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel .<ssssss>two sister restaurant , pat o'brien , brennan 's , and broussard 's be all within a 5 mintue walk from the hotel.this hotel be for 2 type of people .<ssssss>young couples/singles without child , who be interested in party in the french quarter , or individual attend the conference center .<ssssss>other should really consider look elsewhere .<ssssss>i arrive at 3 , and be tell that i could not check in until 4 , so i have to go to the gym -lrb- see below -rrb- to change , and then leave my stuff at the front desk.the hotel have a very worn feel about it .<ssssss>the carpete , furniture , upholestery , all appear quite use .<ssssss>the exercise facility on the tenth floor -lrb- a small pool with greenish appear water , 1 functionaltreadmill , 2 bicycle , be substandard for a holiday inn.the room be very average , although the mattress be comfortable .<ssssss>the ac work well .<ssssss>the bathroom do not have a fan , and get quite humid .<ssssss>the elevator be slow at times.all thing consider , i be disappoint , especially give what we pay ; however , give that i be rarely in the room , it serve its purpose .<ssssss>
5 5 3 5 4 4 3 3		love the sir franci drake !<ssssss>the sf drake be wonderful !<ssssss>its location can not be beat for get around the city and jump on the cable car or walk over to market st. to catch the new train or over to sutter for a bus .<ssssss>it be walk distance to many sight : union square shop , yerba buena garden and moma , the sf center -lrb- now call westfield -rrb- and of course , chinatown .<ssssss>we room be moderate in size ... 2 queen bed and a small bathroom , but be recently renovate and be clean and have a nice , stylish decor .<ssssss>i agree with what some have say about the window ... you really can not see out of they because they be so dirty , but we be not in we room for much of the time and the view be not all that important to we .<ssssss>what we love be the ambiance of the hotel ... a charming , lovingly restore property that have a very friendly staff and provide all the ammenity we could have ask for .<ssssss>we travel with we 2 young child and they love the beefeater who stand guard the hotel and be happy to help or pose for photo .<ssssss>the lobby have a nice bar for meeting friend and have a drink .<ssssss>the hotel have a elegant feel without be too pretentious ... it be comfortable and invite .<ssssss>and , without doubt , the best location for get around the beautiful city by the bay !!<ssssss>
3 3 4 2 4 3 2 4		nice room ; shame about the gloomy hotel the first thing you notice about this hotel be the gloomy lobby .<ssssss>it be all dark wood and low lighting .<ssssss>and forget try to read anything over breakfast in the restaurant , unless you get very close to a window and , even then , you need a light above you .<ssssss>there be little natural light in any of the communal area , and this be my biggest criticism of the hotel .<ssssss>the room themselves -lrb- i be in a regular room , not a suite -rrb- be just fine , with a extremely comfortable bed , lovely linen , and nice touch such as real coffee and a real coffee press .<ssssss>the view be of a parking lot and concrete , but when i try to change room they say all the room have poor view ` because this be a old hotel ' .<ssssss>like most place , some of the staff be great , and some be less so .<ssssss>when my room still have not be clean by 5pm one day , the man at the front desk unapologetically tell I it be a sunday and this be to be expect .<ssssss>for $ 300 a night , you would expect better .<ssssss>a lot of people talk about the character of the place , and this be certainly better than the big chain , but even in august it just feel gloomy .<ssssss>
3 5 3 -1 3 -1 5 -1		not a bad on a budget normally i be a princess when it come to stay in hotel ; nothing short of luxury creep I out .<ssssss>however , i be on a budget , and so i choose to stay at the castle because of the rave review for this budget motel .<ssssss>i be not unimpressed , but i be not impressed either .<ssssss>the staff be extremely accommodate , and the parking be free , even after we check out , which be huge in sf .<ssssss>the room be clean and comfortable , mean i be not creep out .<ssssss>still , i know i be stay in far less than a luxury hotel .<ssssss>but , if you be on a budget , the castle be not a bad choice .<ssssss>-lrb- and centrally located -rrb-<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 5 5 -1		a great location we stay at the lenox on exeter street in boston 's back bay neighborhood over the july 4th weekend .<ssssss>the staff be incredibly helpful and very friendly throughout we stay .<ssssss>the hotel be one block from newbury street , which be the main dining and shopping district in boston , and there be many young people from the city 's many college on this strip .<ssssss>there be definitely a fun and up-beat atmosphere in this neighborhood.the hotel be almost 100 year old and only have two elevator .<ssssss>only one be work for most of the weekend .<ssssss>there be no coffee machine in the room and we be tell we that this be due to a city ordinance .<ssssss>room service be usually prompt about get we a pot of decent coffee within a few minute , though .<ssssss>and there be a starbuck 's located across the street.the room be large , if not old-fashioned in they lay-out .<ssssss>surprisingly , we be never disturb by anyone in the hallway despite there not be any barrier between the bed and the door .<ssssss>there be a large walk-in closet with a iron board , refrigerator and full-size window , so we actually feel like we be in a suite .<ssssss>the bathroom be large and well appoint , but the flourescent lighting above the sink be a challenge to work with .<ssssss>but that appaear to be a city-code thing , too.the staff be always helful and help we plan we we dining and sight-seeing through the city .<ssssss>they keep we car for we a extra half day after we check out for a nominal fee and even bring it around and then re-park it that day so we could store we shop purchase .<ssssss>the location be walk distance to good shopping and dining as well as the museum of fine art .<ssssss>it be minute away on foot to the boston common , garden , and the historical trail through downtown .<ssssss>we walk to the aquarium on long warf in about half a hour.we would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone receive a deal like we do on orbitz , but if you be pay full price you might want to consider a newer hotel if you expect the most up-to-date amenity .<ssssss>
2 3 2 4 5 2 4 4		its great position overcome a few problem we arrive after the long trip from australia feeling pretty tired .<ssssss>the first room offer be on the 4th floor -lrb- which would have be ok -rrb- overlook the bus carpark which be not ok .<ssssss>a request to shift be not well receive but a room on 2nd floor overlook a coutyard be available .<ssssss>the room be comfortable , but the bathroom be very small .<ssssss>the airconditioner very large and noisy when run .<ssssss>apart from the initial problem the staff be very helpful and pleasant .<ssssss>it be very busy and as a result the queue at breakfast be a bit slow as it be in a fairly small room.the main thing go for it be its position near fisherman wharf not far from cable car terminal .<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 2 -1 5 -1		beautiful grounds , room need a update i book this hotel about 6 week prior to my arrival , and be concern once i have read all the negative review .<ssssss>i be expect the worse , but be actually pleasently surprised .<ssssss>upon check-in , i ask for a room upgrade and receive one in the beautiful garden lanai area .<ssssss>walk to the garden , i be very impressed with the care in which the grounds be keep .<ssssss>the gentleman who show we to we room be polite and informative .<ssssss>the room be large , with double sink in the open bathroom , and a balcony overlook the tropical foliage and one of the pool .<ssssss>at first glance , the room seem lovely and clean , but a closer inspection reveal mold and rust and tiny insect .<ssssss>the sprinkler in the ceiling be cake in dust and dirt , the door stopper be melting and cake in dirt , the bathroom have a bare lightbulb near the toilet .<ssssss>plus , everything seem damp all the time.the pool be really cool , but have leaf in they , and the whirlpool have all sort of mold and chemical along the edge .<ssssss>the beach be lovely , with ton of water sport option .<ssssss>the food be really great all around , not a single complaint there .<ssssss>the waiter be friendly and quick , anticipate you need before even call on they .<ssssss>just be sure to expect that the food will be expensive in the resort.lobby be very lively , with live music and bar and the casino .<ssssss>lot of fun!in sum , staff , security , grounds and food be fantastic .<ssssss>room really , really need a update .<ssssss>surround neighborhood be a bit shady .<ssssss>even though i have a lot of fun , i will not stay here again .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 3 1 1 2		incompetent staff at the crowne plaza i book the crowne plaza base on review that say it be convenient for the cruise terminal , and it be convenient.but the hotel have some problem ... primarily the incompetent staff .<ssssss>we arrive from the airport around 10pm , and we be tell that there be no room available ... at 10pm !<ssssss>we be tell to wait in the bar and enjoy a complimentary cocktail.when we walk into the bar , we be greet by a surly bartended who inform we that the bar be close .<ssssss>-lrb- the bar be suppose to be open until 1am accord to the in-room material . -rrb-<ssssss>when we tell he that we would be send there to wait for we room , he agree to give we a drink .<ssssss>we order 2 martini , and be again rudely tell that we could only have beer and wine .<ssssss>so , we have some wine ... serve with a big frown.after wait more than 45 minute , we inquire about we room .<ssssss>the manager seem totally overwhelmed , but he finally manage to find room for we ... and one room be even a suite to we surprise.the room be nice enough .<ssssss>nothing special ... and in the morning , we be just across the street from we cruise ship .<ssssss>the complimentary shuttle service to the cruise terminal be well organize and efficient if you have luggage .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 2 2 3		ordinary .<ssssss>this be my first stay .<ssssss>the hotel have a fine location and the building be one of but a few in singapore that have some character .<ssssss>however , everything else about the hotel - room , reception area , service , food - be 3 rather than 5 star .<ssssss>on the room , they be in poor state of repair - some of electric cable by the desk be tape together and the furniture very worn .<ssssss>on service , it be interesting the hotel randomly upgrade just one of we -lrb- my collegue and i travel on the same booking company -rrb- , my wife could not get through to the hotel despite ring several time and when she get through , be put on hold and disconnect -lrb- when query about this , the hotel explain that one of they operator be on leave -rrb- , the front desk staff be just not great .<ssssss>on food , the club floor breakfast be limit -lrb- 2 choice of cereal ? -rrb-<ssssss>and the main restaurant be again just not great .<ssssss>one final gripe - the vast and impressive lobby area have many table and sofa but most be tag as reserve -lrb- for who ? -rrb-<ssssss>and most table have dirty cutlery , cup etc. it be pretty obvious that the people who have the coffee/food have long leave the table - simply unsightly and poor hygiene .<ssssss>all in all , at these rate , surely it make more sense to stay somewhere consistently reliable like the shangri la or the mandarin oriental .<ssssss>

2 3 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		the real truth about this resort ... i just reurn from my vacation at club golden bahia principe .<ssssss>we be there from july 23-31 ,2005 .<ssssss>prior to leave , i have read many review both good and bad but i decide to go with a open mind and enjoy my vacation and time away with my husband and teenage daughter .<ssssss>we buy a package with air transat .<ssssss>it be a overnight flight so we know that this would be tough .<ssssss>we leave montreal at 11 p.m. arrive in p.c. at 3 a.m. it be wonderful have the check-in do for we as we arrive , this way we be bring by trolley straight to we beautiful room and go straight to sleep .<ssssss>here be my honest take on this resort !<ssssss>food : as long as you stick to the indoor buffet , you be safe !<ssssss>the a la carte restaurant have great ambiance but the food be all the same .<ssssss>i must add that it be not that the food be bad anywhere , it be just that the meat , fish , flour , water , be not the same as we be use to .<ssssss>they do not use fresh herb or spice in they food just a lot of salt and some pepper .<ssssss>in term of the food , i truely believe that they want to please all the guest but that they do not pretend to be american , canadian , or british or other .<ssssss>this hotel chain be spanish own and it cater to those taste .<ssssss>we do not eat at the outdoor restaurant because those that do get sick .<ssssss>as previously mention in other review , the food be often leave out in temperature rise above 90 f , and although they try to maintain the refridgeration -lrb- ice keep ketchup , mayo , and coldcut cool -rrb- it be almost impossible .<ssssss>room : the room be beautiful and spacious .<ssssss>keep clean and tidy .<ssssss>it be important to tip the maid !<ssssss>on the 1 day that we forget , we have no towel or water bottle .<ssssss>communication : since we speak french and english , communicate with the staff be not that much of a problem but we do see a older couple from new england have a very diificult time .<ssssss>the woman have come to activate she room key -lrb- a card with a strip -rrb- that have stop work .<ssssss>they do so immediately , but they neglect to tell she that she would need to change all the key from the people in she party .<ssssss>she have to come back a hour later in 90f heat to change she husband key .<ssssss>employee : this be where we have a problem .<ssssss>i have be to at least 10 all-inclusive resort and this be the first one where the staff seem more unhappy than not .<ssssss>again , perhaps this be just I not understand a cultural difference but i never feel that there be a genuine happiness there .<ssssss>in march we go to a a.i in cuba and even though the people there live with such political / financial resriction , we still feel like we be 1 -rrb- understand and 2 -rrb- respect .<ssssss>air transat : there be absolutely no communication between this air line , and this hotel .<ssssss>we have amy as we air transit tour operator .<ssssss>she explain all the procedure , rule , schedule , excursion , etc. .<ssssss>she give she cell # in case of emergency .<ssssss>when i need to call she about info regard we departure , they tell I she be no longer there and genus be take over.very important info for people come from montreal : we travel agent here in montreal tell we that check-out at the hotel be at noon but since we flight leave at 4 a.m , the hotel allow for a late check-out .<ssssss>not !<ssssss>until we get the right info about this , we have waste we whole last day organize we departure .<ssssss>the tour operator -lrb- genus -rrb- at air transit do not herself know the hotel policy because they change from person to person .<ssssss>this be the where as a pay customer you get really turn off !<ssssss>the hotel tell we that check out be at noon .<ssssss>if we want we room until 6 p.m. we can have it at 10 dollar u.s. if we choose to stay after 6 then it be 99.00 u.s. per person .<ssssss>$ 300:00 in we case .<ssssss>if we choose to check out at noon then they will keep we luggage safe and we can shower in they public shower .<ssssss>please note that the hotel public area be not air conditioned and it be still over 90 and humid in the evening .<ssssss>we choose to stay at $ 10 per hour but we lose that whole last day wait for someone to tell we if we could have another room since ours have someone come to it at 3 p.m. check out be at noon but they do not move we til 1:35 .<ssssss>they have tell we to be there before 8 a.m check out day .<ssssss>when we get there the club golden rep donny be the only person who could get we another room and he be in at 9 a.m. we wait and wait .<ssssss>he tell we to back to we room and he would change we room by 12 .<ssssss>in the end , they want to charge we for 6 hour but they do not give we a room until 1.30 .<ssssss>when we explain that we have waste the whole day wait for donny to get we a room and that it be not 6 hour they make we feel like we be be cheap .<ssssss>i be still not sure if this be a problem with air transat or the hotel but it be terribly plan .<ssssss>i would have prefer to pay for a extra day here in canadian $ before i leave .<ssssss>all in all , i would not go back to this resort .<ssssss>i do not feel like they value my business at all .<ssssss>i pay $ 5000.00 for 3 of we to go and i feel i deserve to be treat with more respect !<ssssss>* as a side note , we take some soda bottle from we hotel fridge to take with we to the airport since we be leave the hotel at 1 a.m. and we be only fly at 4 a.m. we anticipate that the store in the airport would be close at that hour .<ssssss>we leave these soda bottle with we luggage in a plastic bag in what we be tell be the guest service safety room .<ssssss>-lrb- unlock room -rrb- when we go to get we luggage at 1 a.m. the door man who be supposs to be watch this room be drink we 7 up and coke , and water bottle .<ssssss>also , my daughter 's valise be open but nothing be take .<ssssss>a word of advise , bring lock for you luggage !<ssssss>
2 1 2 3 3 1 3 -1		not worth it be price after a long trip we arrive with we child at the hotel at 4 pm and find out we room be not ready yet , although check-out time be n ormally at 12 .<ssssss>we room be only available at 7pm .<ssssss>the room be nothing special , the airconditioning make noise like a grasmower and the restaurant of the hotel be empty in the evening.a plus : the entrance of the hotel and the bar be nice.we would certainly not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>have to many other hotel in balus , this be the worst .<ssssss>
5 4 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		unbeatable location and well price as the other review mention , you can not beat the location .<ssssss>it be in the center of shopping , restaurant and a 2 min walk from the piazza duomo .<ssssss>the room be tastefully and brightly decorate .<ssssss>the bathroom be small but modern and quite clean .<ssssss>the breakfast be good though not large .<ssssss>we have a corner room with a great view of the adjacent square .<ssssss>the only minor complaint be that some of the front desk staff be not very helpful at time .<ssssss>a great value for the price .<ssssss>i would definitely stay again .<ssssss>
2 -1 3 5 5 5 3 5		no restaurant no bar you should know that there be no restaurant apart from breakfast , and no bar at all .<ssssss>a hotel without a bar seem very strange to I .<ssssss>the hotel be label as high tech on every piece of print , and the whole emphasis be on the male business traveller .<ssssss>
3 2 5 4 1 5 1 -1		not # 2 in punta cana -- really !<ssssss>we have be to this part of dom rep for several time and this review be go to be a short one.compared to most of the resort we have stay in before , this one 's food be only o.k but i do not think it be very clean because this be the only time that i be sick and many people i talk to all have bad stomach that last for at least a few day , myself be bad for about a week.the beach and the pool and the room be the only good quality of this hotel , entertainment be bad -lrb- especially the guy on the stage be so not funny it be embarrassing , dancer be ok and michael j be the only good show -rrb- .<ssssss>some staff be very friendly but many be just moody , as i have say before we have be to this country many time , we do understand that the language be a problem but we never mind because the people have always be so nice in this country and a smile say more than a thousand word but i have to say that the staff in this hotel do need to work on the smile bit .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i be very suprised that this resort come on the top of the rank in punta cana as that be the only reason for I to book it at the first place , after have be stay there i really have to say it do not deserve the title , iberostar bavaro be far better in so many ways.and we will not be go back there unless there be a significant improvement .<ssssss>
3 4 3 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great location the best thing about this hotel be the location .<ssssss>there be lot of good eating place around -lrb- not to mention kfc and maccas - although hong kong style -rrb- and easy access to transport .<ssssss>it be in the middle of a shopping district so it be very busy and can be quite noisy .<ssssss>careful of the seedy salesman wait for you to step out of the hotel to try and flog you copy watch and copy handbag .<ssssss>just walk by without look at they or talk to they !<ssssss>the room be extremely small but very clean and very comfortable .<ssssss>we find the bathroom quite big and there be bath salt , dress gown , slipper etc. etc. etc !<ssssss>the staff at reception and the concierge be not overly friendly but overall we be very happy with out stay there<ssssss>

1 1 1 3 1 1 4 3		golden gate holiday inn be awful .<ssssss>my husband and i spend 2 night here late december and book through priceline .<ssssss>i email the hotel directly week ahead of time and request a king bed and be tell no problem .<ssssss>when we arrive at the hotel there be only one man behind the desk and a line of about 12 people wait to check in .<ssssss>then ii be give a attitude about the fact that we book on priceline and that we be to get a queensize bed and the direct booking be get the king .<ssssss>they say if i have the email of my request they could do something but we do not think we need to carry proof .<ssssss>big mistake.then we be give a room right by the elevator .<ssssss>noise all morning .<ssssss>no ice maker on floor 10 and 30 buck a night to park.this be not a 3 star hotel in my opiniion but a 2 .<ssssss>would not stay again .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 5 3 5 1		nice but some frustration i want to love the hilton , and in some way , i do , but in other , we be disappoint .<ssssss>my husband and i just come back from enjoy two day there relax over new year 's , and there be positive .<ssssss>we room be clean and large by city standard , but i agree with earlier post that size of room be completely luck of the draw base on what i see on the floor diagram .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable , and the location of the hotel be great for be out and about in the city for first night -- close enough to get there fast but far enough away to avoid the worst of the noise .<ssssss>the staff be great -- helpful and courteous , though we be disappoint that we request for a upper-floor room be not duly note until we point it out , and then we be only put on floor 9 -lrb- of a 15 floor hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>we room maid be wonderful , however .<ssssss>breakfast in the hotel restaurant be fabulous -- a really good buffet though it be part of a package for we .<ssssss>not cheap if you have to pay separately , but worth it.and that bring I to the negative .<ssssss>the hotel nickel and dime you with charge for thing that in other hotel might be part of the high rate charge .<ssssss>wireless internet be on a per-day charge , and if you instead decide that you will just use the hotel 's business center , be prepare to pay a minimum of a $ 10 charge then $ 1 per minute after 10 minute .<ssssss>this seem ludicrous to we who just want to check we e-mail .<ssssss>the bottle of water in the room be available for a mere $ 4.50 each -lrb- we buy some of we own nearby for a lot less -rrb- , and a $ 80 charge for dinner in the hotel bar when we only have a few drink and two light entree seem really high , even by hotel restaurant standard .<ssssss>in general , it seem that the four-star rating be not really warrant give how many of the little extra one expect at four-star locale involve extra charge here .<ssssss>in addition , there be some aging issue -- the sheet that have a hole along the edge where it be fold over on we bed ; the scratchy towel that be too old to still be soft and fluffy ; the slightly worn wood on the furniture like the arm chair and entertainment center .<ssssss>the room be also quite noisy , in part due to the expect city sound , but also due to how easily we could here we loud neighbor across the hall as they come and went.it be not a bad experience -- in fact , we be quite happy when all be say and do .<ssssss>but with a little more inclusiveness in they rate and some upgrading of slightly age fixture , this hotel could more fully embody a four-star experience .<ssssss>

2 3 3 5 4 4 3 2		good and bad we stay there for 5 nights.the good.first of all location be very good - 3 minute walk to the sant station wish give access to train , bus and metro.secondly the breakfast at the hotel offer a lot of variety and staff be helpful.the bad : the room face the road and be extremely noisy - especially as the road seem to be use by every ambulance in barcelona !!<ssssss>this make it difficult to get a good night sleep.secondly , the hotel appear to only have one music cd - which they play in the lift , at breakfast and in all public area .<ssssss>must admit that have hear the cd continuously for 5 day - will not be rush out to buy same cd !!<ssssss>
3 3 5 5 5 3 3 2		beautiful , but just not for I i have stay at the village numerous time for long visit .<ssssss>even as a repeat guest and diamond hilton honor member -lrb- if you do not know what this mean , join hilton honor and find out - it be great ! -rrb-<ssssss>, i find that my treatment at this hotel vary .<ssssss>my first trip , last year , be wonderful .<ssssss>i receive a upgrade room with a lovely partial ocean view .<ssssss>subsequent trip ping-pong between good and ok .<ssssss>my last trip be horrible .<ssssss>i be treat extremely rudely on check in , give a sub-par room -lrb- the lady claim there be no better one , but other in my party be give much better room even though they be not frequent guest -rrb- , harass when my husband stay with I for two night -lrb- which be suppose to be free for hilton honor member -rrb- , and treat horribly both time i try to eat on the premise .<ssssss>one waitress at the tapa bar ignore we for twenty minute while she chat with the bar-tender - and then tell we that the bar be close !<ssssss>as i walk away from the bar , i hear the bar-tender offer another patron a drink .<ssssss>as a general rule , the food at the village be over-priced , not that great , and totally unavailable after about 9pm - but it be a walk to the main part of waikiki .<ssssss>they be even rude when i try to leave my luggage at the bell desk while i go to get my car at check out .<ssssss>i be not feel the aloha.as a business traveler , i also find the village a bit crowded .<ssssss>the pool area be busy and expose , there be no hot tub , and it be not relax .<ssssss>to be fair , the village be lovely - the pool , flora , fauna , and view be all beautiful .<ssssss>there be live music every night and it be right on a gorgeous stretch of beach and a lagoon - but i can not help but feel that i be in a mall every time i stay there .<ssssss>it be so crowded - and a little like disneyland .<ssssss>the amenity be just not what i be use to when i travel for business .<ssssss>they simply do not cater to executive traveler .<ssssss>everything feel like it be cost they extra effort - from charge a meal to my room at one of the over-priced and sub-par restaurant to the little detail that make my constant life on the road bearable , like pick up my dry-cleaning , or rectify a incorrect room charge .<ssssss>i find this very strange , since the only reason they be not empty like many other waikikus hotel be the fact that they host so many convention and business travelers.i guess the bottom line be - it be beautiful , but it be not for I .<ssssss>
2 3 1 2 3 5 3 2		do not come if you be use to chain hotel i know this be a boutique hotel , but there be some thing that you expect from a hotel .<ssssss>a lot of thing be miss so brace yourself if you stay here.as a qualifier , i travel pretty frequently for business , but this trip be for leisure.the good : the hotel definitely have that cool trendy vibe and the bar / pool area be truly excellent .<ssssss>also the room have a ipod speaker .<ssssss>wireless internet be free.the bad :1 .<ssssss>room not well design : about 3 foot above we king size bed be a twin size bunk bed that make sleep very uncomfortable .<ssssss>there be also no desk or place to put you wallet , purse , etc. except on the bathroom counter .2 .<ssssss>room be way too dark : there be just one dimly light light in the bathroom which make it hard for girl to put on makeup .3 .<ssssss>miss some basic amenity : lotion be not standard in the room .4 .<ssssss>poor operation / service : wake up call do not come as request at 9:30 am .<ssssss>i get a call at 10:10 be ask if i get a wake up call but that would not have help if i have a important meeting .<ssssss>also , housekeeping do not reset the radio alarm so we have a nice wake-up at 4am -lrb- who wake up at 4am in a hotel like this ! -rrb-<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 2 2 1		horrible place , avoid at all cost we be suppose to stay here for three night , but only stay one .<ssssss>my husband and i have stay in some pretty utilitarian place over the year , but this be by far the worst .<ssssss>we have never cancel a reservation after see the condition of the accommodation , so this be a first for us.i guess we first clue should have come when we have a really hard time make a reservation .<ssssss>the reason it be so difficult , be because the e-mail address on the pension 's site be no longer operational .<ssssss>i finally have to call , and then the front desk person provide I with a functional e-mail address .<ssssss>it would not have take much effort to update the web site .<ssssss>last time i check , the incorrect address be still list on the site.the room only have one electrical outlet , and this be in the bathroom .<ssssss>forget plug in a computer , or any other device for that matter .<ssssss>in addition , we be tell that internet service be available in the lobby but , when we get there , we be tell that they use to have it but it be be break for a while and need to be fixed.if we have not bring ear plug , we would not have get any sleep .<ssssss>the noise from outside be constant until about 4 or 5:00 am.the location be appeal , but there be lot of hotel and pension near la rambla , so the pension dalus be not unique in this regard , and its location alone would be no reason to book here .<ssssss>also , there be really nothing about dalus that be reflect in the pension , except a picture of he that hang over the front desk.some of the front desk people act like we be a bother , for example , the one that be sleep on the couch when we go downstairs.while the room smell strongly of bleach , there be mold grow on the toilet tank and between the shower tile .<ssssss>there be also a pile of dirt under the radiator , which suggest that the room have not be thoroughly clean in quite some time .<ssssss>the tub be so small , we keep feel like we be go to slip and fall if we moved.the price for a double room with private bathroom be 59 euro per night , which be approximately $ 74.00 .<ssssss>the room we get be worth maybe -lrb- maybe ! -rrb-<ssssss>30 euro per night -lrb- $ 38 -rrb- .<ssssss>

2 2 2 1 5 2 2 -1		not so good the goods : the bed be very comfortable and the free water bottle and apple be fun.the bad : not a sophisticated hotel .<ssssss>the fire alarm go off twice while we be there -lrb- once for a quite a while -rrb- , the phone have no instruction on they so you do not know how to call to the front desk -lrb- much less anywhere else -rrb- , everything that occur on you hallway be incredibly loud -lrb- if you be a light sleeper , this be not the place to stay -rrb- , upon we arrival they be train a new employee -lrb- we understand that people have to be train but not while weary traveler be wait to get to they room -rrb- , everything be loose in the bathroom -lrb- eg , the fixture on the sink and the sink itself -rrb- and the doorless shower yield quite a lot of water on the floor by the time you be finish , no washcloth , no bar soap .<ssssss>recommendation : put off you trip another 4 month and stay at the bany oriental .<ssssss>that be what we be do next time.in all fairness , i will say , again , that the bed be just lovely and the room be very clean and the room be a good price .<ssssss>

2 1 1 5 3 5 5 1		disappointing - tiny room have to say i be very disappointed.on a positive note the location be fantastic -lrb- right in the middle of everything -rrb- , we find the staff pleasant and professional , and the concierge be very helpful.hereâs the problem â?for 500 euro a night we stay in a shoe box .<ssssss>i stay in european hotel frequently for work , so know they tend to be small , but at this price point this be ridiculous .<ssssss>it didnât end there , some strange room feature detract from we stay .<ssssss>first off , we find the bedding particularly uncomfortable -lrb- the sheet seem like sandpaper -rrb- .<ssssss>also frustrate - the only switch for the bathroom light be located outside the bathroom door -lrb- i.e. in the bedroom -rrb- , which mean that if one of we wake up in the middle of the night , we have to turn the light on and then open the bathroom door to enter â?drowning the bed in bright light -lrb- as the bed be of course about a foot from the bathroom give the size of the room -rrb- .<ssssss>also , when my wife try to use the hair dryer she quickly learn that only the electric socket outside of the bathroom work at all , and even that produce little heat -lrb- and after a few minute it cease to produce heat at all -rrb- .<ssssss>the fitness center be also very tiny and cramped with no area to lay out and stretch â?as a result you have to navigate around body on the floor in the middle of the few machine .<ssssss>some of these may sound nitpicky â?but at $ 700 a night i donât believe they be acceptable .<ssssss>

1 1 1 3 1 3 2 2		disgust and dilapidated room i have have the displeasure of stay here twice within the past two month on priceline reservation .<ssssss>the room i be give be absolutey disgusting and dilapidated .<ssssss>the most disturbing be the huge amount of mold pack into the air vent .<ssssss>i suspect this be why the wallpaper be buckle and peel off the wall along with outlet cover and fixture .<ssssss>the furniture and carpet be very soil , wear and have burn hole in they .<ssssss>the bath have large place of miss caulk and mold in the shower .<ssssss>i make the mistake of visit the pool area once .<ssssss>it be a mess .<ssssss>the pool be dirty , there be trash and bird crap everywhere and the pool lounge cushion be moldy .<ssssss>i would not dare get into the pool and definitely not into the green water in the hot tub.i can not believe that starwood allow this dump to operate as a sheraton .<ssssss>in my opinion , the room be not up to standard of the sleaziest rent by hour motel .<ssssss>starwood should do a massive room overhaul immediately or pull the sheraton flag from this disgrace .<ssssss>
4 3 5 3 5 5 4 -1		a nice stay .<ssssss>my wife and i recently return from a week-long stay at the four season miami .<ssssss>first of all , as have be mention in many of the review , the hotel be in the brickell business area , which be essentially shut down after 5 pm during the week and be equally desert on the weekend .<ssssss>this make for a very quiet stay , despite the fact the hotel be host participant in a latin music award program .<ssssss>for eat and other activity outside the hotel , however , there be limited choice .<ssssss>cab ride to coral gable , cocconut grove and south beach be likely if you stay as long as we do .<ssssss>you can use the metromover and metrorail system to get around as well .<ssssss>the hotel lobby and room be very nice , exceptionally clean , and consistent with the four season we have stay in elsewhere .<ssssss>the valet , bellservice , and housekeeping personnel be very nice although some language barrier do exist .<ssssss>we find the concierge service to be friendly but inconsistently helpful .<ssssss>some of the best recommendation come from the bellman and room service staff .<ssssss>the room service food be good and we be give prompt , polite attention .<ssssss>the pool be very nice and we be able to obtain a cabana for shade without difficulty .<ssssss>the server poolside be friendly but occasionally not very attentive .<ssssss>overall , i would recommend stay at the four season if business require you to be in this part of the city .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 -1 4 3 3		excellent location for sightseeing we come here for my spouse 's conference and get a $ 130 rate for two .<ssssss>we room be excellent , with a partial bay view -- probably because we be both gold passport member .<ssssss>i think the you get what you pay for comment from another reviewer be true ; hotel also reward loyalty.the room be fine , on a low floor away from the elevator as per we \ profile .<ssssss>it have a small balcony which -lrb- if it be a bit warmer or drier -rrb- would be nice to sit on to see the bay and embaracero area.the honor bar be touch-sensitive but i manage to slide some cheese in on top of the beer .<ssssss>-lrb- note that if you do move something and be charge , if you have not consume it , you can get they to take it off you bill ! -rrb-<ssssss>the soap and lotion amenity be nice quality and scented with white ginger.morning coffee be via a small coffeemaker in the room -lrb- ugh -rrb- or via a $ 2/cup honor bar in the atrium .<ssssss>that coffee be fine .<ssssss>breakfast bufffet be perfectly ok but not extraordinary .<ssssss>you be across from the ferry building with its food market , so with a little planning you can get food there to bring back for the morning or just go over there for breakfast.i be a tourist on this trip , so i find the location superb -- on the flat for easy walking , close to ferry for scenic ride , a reasonable walk to fisherman wharf/pier 39/the ballpark .<ssssss>it be right at the embaracadero bart/muni stop .<ssssss>you can be at ocean beach in under half a hour , or at golden gate park .<ssssss>this definitely be my new favorite hotel in sf .<ssssss>and if you see the man with the gray cat on the sidewalk by the bagel place , please help they out !<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 4 4 5 1		intercontinental century city - it be all about the detail we recently stay 5 night at the century city intercontinental hotel in november of 2007 .<ssssss>we book we stay with hotwire and pay $ 219/night ... it be a little expensive compare to what other reviewer pay , but we basically book it within a month , so it be the cheapest i could find in the beverly hills/century city area.i be really excite to stay here , but mostly because i have not be on vacation for a long time .<ssssss>after book with hotwire , i call the hotel and put in a request with reservation for a nice room with a king bed and a nice view - plus , we have a flat screen tv , which be a nice touch .<ssssss>fortunately for we , when we arrive , they have honor we request , which be really nice !<ssssss>we stay in 1512 and have a great view since it be a corner unit.overall , i would say that this hotel be very nice - definitely a 3 to 3.5 star hotel .<ssssss>the detail be what bring down its rating in my book -lrb- see the end of my review for more -rrb- .<ssssss>it be obviously more suit to the business traveler , but be centrally located near good shopping - you have get venice beach to the west and west hollywood to the east .<ssssss>there be a free concierge car service to rodeo drive in the heart of beverly hill , which be a nice touch - however , they warn you that they will not go beyond rodeo drive and the hour be not conducive to late night .<ssssss>the lobby be really nice and the 24 hour exercise facility be excellent .<ssssss>make sure to go to the spa and ask for a locker and you will have access to the spa 's nice shower area .<ssssss>the locker room close at 11 pm , but the spa close at 9 pm .<ssssss>if you want to use the locker room from 9-11 pm , make sure to go to concierge and ask for a key there.a lot of reviewer be shock at the price of room service and the item in the minus fridge , but seriously , you be stay at a 4 star hotel within 2 mile of beverly hill , what do you expect ?<ssssss>i would not be stupid enough to order room service or grab anything out of the fridge .<ssssss>instead , head to the century city westfield mall , about a mile away and go to the grocery store , gelson 's , and pick up some snack there .<ssssss>although the fridge be seal , you can also chill you drink use the ice basket provide .<ssssss>one nice touch be that they provide you with free fijus water - we get 3 each time they clean the room .<ssssss>note , they do a general cleaning in the morning and a turn down service at night , so they will knock on you door before noon and probably around 8 or 9 pm .<ssssss>the turndown service be also really nice touch .<ssssss>one thing about the cleaning service : we stay for 5 night at the hotel and we notice a drop off in the quality of the cleaning towards the end of we stay - for instance , not all the towel be replenish and we no longer receive 3 bottle of fijus , but only 2 .<ssssss>again , head to the century city mall for most of you dining need as it be not only a gorgeous outdoor mall , but the food be very fresh and there be a lot of selection at the food court and other dining establishments.details : although we guest room -lrb- 1512 -rrb- be impressive at first glance , there be some issue i observe that bring down my overall impression at the intercontinental century city .<ssssss>first of all , the heating and a/c unit be very loud , but function very well .<ssssss>secondly , the price of wireless internet access be exorbitant -lrb- nearly $ 10/day ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>a hotel of this caliber should have free wireless access , especially consider the amount of business client at the hotel .<ssssss>note : you can go to the business center -lrb- not the greatest at all -rrb- and also pay for internet access -rrb- , but you can also go to a little cubby near the check in desk ... there be a tiny claustrophobic space where they have a free internet terminal .<ssssss>sometimes people stand in a line wait to use it , so just be aware of that.thirdly , there be no in-room mirror -lrb- they be only in the bathroom -rrb- , so it be inconvenient get dress before we leave we room .<ssssss>fourthly , the cost of mandatory valet parking be ridiculous .<ssssss>although i understand that the custom in la be pay parking -lrb- a lot of place , such as the westfield mall offer the first 1.5 to 3 hour free -rrb- , $ 30 a day be quite high - however , the valet service be excellent , so it feel like you be get what you pay for .<ssssss>lastly , the bathroom also look impressive upon first glance ... however , upon closer inspection , i be shock at the lack of attention to detail .<ssssss>for instance , the bathroom countertop be not properly attach to the wall , so where it connected , instead of a waterproof seal , the wallpaper extend onto the countertop to cover up the absence of any waterproof seal .<ssssss>finally , although the separate shower be a nice touch , the tiling in the shower be a little uneven .<ssssss>again , these be small detail , but in a top tier hotel , it be the detail that count.i think overall , i would rate this hotel a 3.5 .<ssssss>have it not be for the detail , i would have definitely say a 4 , or possibly a 4.25 .<ssssss>but due to the lack of attention to detail , i would overall rate this as a 3.5 .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 5 2 2 5		average stay we didnât enjoy we stay at this hotel .<ssssss>the room be clean and the bathroom be clean and large and the location be great .<ssssss>it be right across the street from the cathedral and a few minute walk from the rambla .<ssssss>we walk everywhere while we be there .<ssssss>the first thing we didnât like be the bed .<ssssss>it be really hard .<ssssss>they do put a blanket under the sheet to make it a bit more comfortable after we ask they four time , but the bed be still really hard .<ssssss>the front desk wasnât very helpful .<ssssss>when we check in at 830 in the morning when be get off a cruise ship they tell we t come back at 3 to get into we room .<ssssss>that be expect but when we return to get into we room they give away we nonsmoking room to someone else before we .<ssssss>they didnât seem to care that we be there at 830 in the morning and already check in .<ssssss>one morning they didnât give we the wake-up call we ask for .<ssssss>after that we depend on we cell phone alarm instead not want to try that again .<ssssss>also in the bathroom when they take the washcloth they didnât replace it for the next day .<ssssss>it be a shame that this hotel have so many problem .<ssssss>it be really nice place in a good location .<ssssss>it just seem like the people didnât know how to manage the hotel .<ssssss>
2 3 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		disappointment at the pelham i be disappoint in the cleanness of the room , it be terrible , the hotel also have a bad smell especially the loby and the elevator -lrb- like raid roach spray -rrb- the staff be good for the most part .<ssssss>the location be good and bad at the same time if that possible .<ssssss>it be a good overall location to get to all the hot spot but the street around it be bad with a homeless shelter across the street , i do not have a prblem with the homeless shelter but i do have a problem with all the homeless people outside the shelter and not inside late at night .<ssssss>finally i do not know if the extra $ 8.00 + tax per night be a hotel rule or a state law but i do not know i have to pay it until i check in .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 4 5 4 -1		excellent location , average hotel my husband and i book this hotel for 4 night for my birthday after read the wonderful review and be somewhat disappoint with the royal magda .<ssssss>have stay there , it be a good value hotel , which be clean and in a excellent location.the room be very small and the bathroom tiny .<ssssss>we be on the fourth floor and could hear the family in the next room .<ssssss>there be only 3 pillow so have to take turn for the third pillow , the area to store all you clothes be extremely small and the space between the bed and the furniture and wall be so limited that it be difficult for the two of we to pass each other and we be not particularly big!location : excellent .<ssssss>a short distance from the from the champ elysee and the arc de triomphe .<ssssss>this be the best feature of the hotel , in we opinion.customer service : johan be very friendly and helpful although when i book the hotel - they website state that there be a late checkout facility , when we ask we be inform that we have to be out of we room by 12.30 at the latest .<ssssss>i ask the night clerk if there be somewhere we could wash and change before leave for the airport and we be tell ` no ' , although when we ask johan again when check out he do say we could use the toilet on the ground floor.extras : we do not try the 12 euro/day breakfast , as there be very good brasserie in the local area .<ssssss>the lift be small , and only really hold one person and a suitcase or two adult .<ssssss>i would recommend the royal magda for budget traveller look for a clean hotel for a good price .<ssssss>i just can not give this hotel the rave review that everyone else have .<ssssss>it be not one of the best hotel experience we have had.just a recommendation for other traveller stay here - try the bistro du 17 restaurant which be probably about 10 minute walk away at 108 avenue de villier .<ssssss>a excellent three course meal with a bottle of wine between two people be 34 euro per per person and be excellent .<ssssss>
2 2 2 1 5 3 3 4		spend a bit more and stay right on the beach .<ssssss>i can not believe all the rave review of this hotel !<ssssss>it be rate 4-star , but i have no idea why .<ssssss>i would never come here again , and i would never recommend it to anyone .<ssssss>in fact , i write hotwire and complain that if they say i be get a 4-star hotel , i expect much more .<ssssss>if you want a cheap stay in hawaii , then yes , it be probably a good place to stay ... but i regret that my on my first trip all the way from the east coast to paradise that i do not spend more money and stay right on the ocean in a more beautiful hotel .<ssssss>very disappointing .<ssssss>
1 2 3 3 5 1 1 5		disappointing we reserve parking at the hotel and even phone the hotel to confirm this .<ssssss>upon arrival the receptionist tell we in a very rude and dismissive manner that the parking be full and that we would have to park elsewhere .<ssssss>the elsewhere turn out to cost 23 euro a day and be quite far from the hotel .<ssssss>my husband then ask to see the manager who be even less accomodate and extremely unpleasant .<ssssss>she have a contradict story and say that the parking have flood .<ssssss>she also point out that a person should choose a hotel for the room and not the parking!there be also a terrible smell of sewage in the elevator which also fill we room and do not make for a very romantic ambiance -lrb- perhaps it be the flood carpark . -rrb-<ssssss>at time there be no hot water and we end up take cold shower .<ssssss>we be all in all rather disappoint with the hotel and do not think it be worthy of 4 star .<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 3 5 5 4		nice palce this hotel be located in a lovely old yellow house , 30 min bus ride from down town seattle -lrb- line 70-74 -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be clean , shared bathroom be clean but expect to wait a little bit for you turn .<ssssss>breakfast serve at the top floor : cereal , granola , bagel , english muffin , coffee , yogurt , jam .<ssssss>do not be late 'cause refill be scarce .<ssssss>wireless internet , no tv , little sink in the room , window be not block all the noise but the surround area be quiet .<ssssss>prior to reservation we check the review and ask for a room not near the bar , which fortunately be not active during we stay .<ssssss>3 story high with no elevator .<ssssss>.<ssssss>there be plenty of student cafe near by .<ssssss>check the adjacent washington university , it be gorgeous !<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great hotel !<ssssss>we love we stay at the cambridge suite .<ssssss>i have to admit to be a little disappointed when we first see the suite .<ssssss>the decor remind I of a hampton inn or something of that level , not a nice hotel in downtown toronto .<ssssss>that soon fade away , however , as i discover what a excellent location it have and all of the nice extra .<ssssss>the mini-bar area be nicely equip with glass , corkscrew , etc. the refrigerator be a nice touch , particularly the real milk for coffee .<ssssss>the room be spacious and well-laid-out and the bed be really comfortable .<ssssss>the turndown service be very nice , particularly the bottled water that they leave .<ssssss>the best feature , though , be the 2pm check-out time .<ssssss>it be great to be able to have access to the room until it be time to head to the airport .<ssssss>the complimentary breakfast be good , but the breakfast room get extremely crowd .<ssssss>overall , this hotel be a excellent home base for explore toronto and boast lot of nice extra touch .<ssssss>we will definitely stay there again when visit toronto !<ssssss>
2 3 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		security concern at the grand hyatt .<ssssss>alcatraz lighthouse<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 2 1 2 1		terrible , just horrible !<ssssss>recently spend three night with my wife at this dump ... need major renovation .<ssssss>it be nothing like they website ... all the pic on the web must have be take with a wide angle lens ... my room face powell street on the third floor and be the size of a postage stamp .<ssssss>all we hear be street noise and be force to sleep with the window open because there be no a/c , i repeat , there be no a/c !!!<ssssss>what kind of place have no a/c ... very bad .<ssssss>we would have check out , but every room in town be book because major marathon in town .<ssssss>all i hear from other guest be complaint after complaint ... stay away !!!!<ssssss>
2 2 3 2 3 1 1 3		bad first impression .<ssssss>my partner have secretly arrange with the staff to have a bottle of champagne , champagne glass that be send over from bloomingdale , and two tux be to be in the room when we arrive .<ssssss>he even tell they what time we be to arrive .<ssssss>upon check in we be tell we room might be ready , and i tell they that be ok , we can check we bag , walk around and come back later .<ssssss>instead , we be send up to we room .<ssssss>this be simple ... the front desk could have stall by ask we to have a seat in the bar , but do not .<ssssss>we get to we room it be not 30 seconds when the champagne arrive .<ssssss>the glass tux 's arrive some time later ... seperatly ... mind you , they have be sit downstairs at the concierge all morning .<ssssss>we be give a verbal appology by the manager , but you can not undo something like that and expect it to be enough .<ssssss>they could have comp the champagne , but we do not pursue it .<ssssss>i have high hope for this property by read all of the posting , but the hotel blow it for I big time .<ssssss>
5 5 4 3 5 5 5 3		great hotel , superb service the shangri-la be a superb , top class , hotel .<ssssss>the room be excellent , as be the staff , and quality of service .<ssssss>unfortunately , we could only stay for one night on a stopover on the way to australia.itâs a 30 minute taxi ride from changi airport to a friendly welcome from the efficient staff on arrival .<ssssss>despite we early arrival -lrb- 11am -rrb- , check-in with we prebooked voucher be a breeze .<ssssss>we heavy luggage be whisk up to we deluxe room by a friendly bellman -lrb- with a bright red jacket and pill box hat -rrb- who delight in show we all the roomâs facility .<ssssss>the room in the garden wing on the 10th floor be spacious with chair , a desk , broadband , a large well-appointed , bathroom , and a comfortable bed .<ssssss>the garden be really nice with luxuriant flower and other vegetation ; we do not have time to use the nice swimming pool.the buffet breakfast offer good , wholesome , hot and cold food with a wide variety of choice , include good back bacon -lrb- not the cheap streaky/fatty stuff offer by we hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>really excellent and hassle free .<ssssss>have a sumptuous cantonese meal at the hotelâs -lrb- expensive -rrb- shang palace restaurant .<ssssss>truly a culinary experience with excellent service.although you be near to orchard street and various shopping mall -lrb- singapore price be not that cheap ! -rrb-<ssssss>, the hotelâs suburban location mean a lot of -lrb- cheap -rrb- taxi ride .<ssssss>in the one and half day we spend in singapore , we visit chinatown -lrb- donât miss the china town heritage centre on pagoda street , which provide a poignant portrait of the territory migrant history , the islamic mosque -lrb- donât expect much if you have visit istanbul or the middle east -rrb- , and little india .<ssssss>not have visit india , we be enthral by a visit to the sri mariamman temple temple on south bridge road and the sri veeramakaliamman temple on serangoon road in little india , where we witness a remarriage ceremony , which involve the man and woman be douse by successive dunk of water , and numerous believer receive âblessingsâ?from the numerous swamis.expensive but good value for money give the quality and location of this hotel .<ssssss>the staff be excellent : every time we pass a staff member , we receive a friendly smile and solicitation.we would have like to stay longer and be sorry to leave .<ssssss>one negative : no free in-room internet .<ssssss>give the cost , this be rather sad .<ssssss>
3 3 5 4 4 3 3 2		could have be excellent i use to stay at the capitol tokyu on every visit to tokyo .<ssssss>however , capitol tokyu be now be rebuild so this time i stay at one of they other hotel in the much more hip area of shibuya .<ssssss>capitol tokyu be a very old and well establish hotel , so everyone know where it be .<ssssss>this time , i have trouble with the taxi guy at the bullet train station who have never hear of cerulean .<ssssss>the name be not so familiar yet and shibuya be so big and busy that if they have not hear of it , it would be very hard to find , with so many tall building in the area .<ssssss>the taxi arrive at the hotel after be stick in shibuya traffic for quite a long time -lrb- taxi be not cheap in tokyo , let I remind you , so be stick in bad traffic will cost you the price of fly with a low cost airline in another country -rrb- .<ssssss>and when we get to the front , there be no-one there to welcome we or help we with we luggage .<ssssss>i have to run inside and ask someone at the reception to come out and take we luggage inside .<ssssss>not a good first impression .<ssssss>check in be ok good and the room itself be nice .<ssssss>the view from the bedroom be absolutely amazing , look down to see all of the craziness of shibuya from the 30th floor , and look out to see all the building , park and street of tokyo in the distance , you can even see the tokyo tower from you room !<ssssss>i doubt if the view from any other hotel room in tokyo can be as good as this .<ssssss>truly truly amazing .<ssssss>however , here be the worst thing about this place : the internet connection .<ssssss>i be there for business and need to use internet and email constantly .<ssssss>first of all , internet in the room here be not free , which i think if you be pay this kind of price for a business hotel in a modern city like tokyo you really should be get complimentary internet access .<ssssss>second of all , the connection itself be very shoddy , constantly get disconnect and timed-out , not the fastest connection to begin with .<ssssss>this be a very frustrating thing to have happen when you be suppose to be communicate with people back home and write email all night .<ssssss>can not download any large file because once you connection be cut you have to start it up again from the beginning .<ssssss>if the hotel be slow you work progress down , that be not a major problem for business traveller who already do not have enough time in the office .<ssssss>be right in shibuya have its good and bad , but it be still a cool place to be in tokyo , everything be here , shop , department store , restaurant , bar , subway and jr line .<ssssss>but shibuya be pretty much at the left corner of the map at the end of the line so it be also quite far from other area like ginza .<ssssss>when i use to stay at capitol tokyo at kokkai-gijido mae it be not in a hip area like shibuya but it be in the middle of many place like roppongus , ginza , shinjuku , harajuku and even shibuya so it be a good central base to be in .<ssssss>breakfast here be serve in 3 different restaurant for 3 different style / cuisine so you have to make a choice of what cuisine you want before you sit down .<ssssss>this mean that you can not be have western breakfast while you colleague have japanese .<ssssss>i try both and be more impressed with the japanese breakfast eventhough that restaurant be totally empty .<ssssss>try the croissant in the western breakfast buffet though , one of the best i have ever have .<ssssss>room service be very good , although very very expensive .<ssssss>a bowl of unagi and rice will set you back about 4300 yen !<ssssss>no complimentary water in the room either .<ssssss>again , with this kind of room rate , what be a little thing like bottled water for guest ?<ssssss>seem like they be forget the small detail that make a difference .<ssssss>overall , have the potential to be really excellent , with good location and a great view .<ssssss>all the basics be there , management just need a little fine tuning .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 1 2 -1		need a renovation of service we book this vacation month ago , but find out the week before depart -lrb- from a disgruntled co-worker who have just return -rrb- that the hotel be under major renovation -- with 2 of the 3 pool close , and a abundance of noise .<ssssss>we contact the hotel and ask for some form of reassurance/compensation and be tell that we should have know about it and there be nothing to be do except cancel we trip and come back next year when the renovation be complete .<ssssss>of course , they would not do anything to comp we airfare .<ssssss>so , frustrated , we decide to go and take a chance as it be a much need vacation .<ssssss>we arrive to room not be ready but the hotel itself have grand lobby and seem like it use to be the place to be .<ssssss>once we get we room , we be discourage to find they dirty -lrb- hair that do not belong to we , cigarette on we porch -rrb- , and not of a class you would expect to pay $ 300 + for .<ssssss>additionally , the spa be close .<ssssss>i recheck they website and none of this be mention .<ssssss>the service issue be consistent , with waiter at the outside restaurant who could not remember order , we return to we room in the evening to find that housekeeping have never come , a less than clean pool -lrb- the only one that be open -rrb- and a basically unaccommodating staff .<ssssss>the only bright spot be the bartender , who be capable and nice -- perhaps because they realize that we have money to spend and would type well for deserving service .<ssssss>all in all , you can see that this place use to be nice , and the grounds be under major renovation so they should be nice again .<ssssss>however , if they can not manage basic service and cleanliness when they be less than half full they would need to renovate they entire staff to get back up to the class where they deserve the rate they seek .<ssssss>for similar rate , i would go to the intercontinental next store that have a much better attitude , and you can still visit the esj at night .<ssssss>or , splurge a bit more for the ritz down the road which be in a different stratosphere of class and service .<ssssss>
2 2 2 2 3 5 5 3		okay for the price i find this motel via the internet-it be we third trip to sf and we decide to try something different than we first stay , which be in the financial district -lrb- second visit be a one day trip -rrb- .<ssssss>the website be very well write and the photo be very enchanting .<ssssss>we be a bit disappointed upon we arrival .<ssssss>not have much knowledge of the area , we do not realize the motel be right on a main thoroughfare ; very busy with traffic .<ssssss>the picture on the website and the customer review create this image of a motel nestle in a quiet corner of the marina district , but this be not true .<ssssss>the room be quite small but okay for the two of we .<ssssss>we be right next to a room which allow pet and the wall be very thin , so we hear the dog bark for 5 hour straight one night because they leave they unattended in they room .<ssssss>we almost call management but it be we last night , so we do not make a big deal about it .<ssssss>also , we could hear the neighbor come in and out each and every time .<ssssss>the room be clean but they have a very old style heater in the room and it only heat the top half of the room .<ssssss>so , when we be on the bed watch tv , we would be cold but when we stand up , it would be toasty warm .<ssssss>it be okay for the duration of we visit and for the price , well , we get what we pay for , in we opinion .<ssssss>the website and the picture be in a way , deceive because there be no cobblestone in the courtyard and it be not really a quiet stay .<ssssss>i think if they include a picture of they neon light sign , which be conveniently leave out of the picture on the website , people would not be so quick to fall in love with the place ; sight unseen .<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		love the hhv my husband , 2 child -lrb- 7 3 -rrb- , and i stay here in may , 2005 for 2 week in the alli tower .<ssssss>we love the resort and the island as well .<ssssss>the resort be large and impose but we like that because there be a lot of shop and amenity and you could blend in and not really be bother .<ssssss>room : it be true what they say , if you can afford the alli tower stay there .<ssssss>we do and it be well worth the extra money .<ssssss>the room have a large -lrb- about 32 -rrb- flat panel lcd tv in every room , there be even a mini tv in the bathroom .<ssssss>the bed be heavenly , with thick duvet and large comfy down pillow .<ssssss>there be a separate dressing/makeup area that be outside the bathroom area with a large vanity , sink and mirror , so two people could be get ready at the same time .<ssssss>the only down side to the room be they be look a little worn .<ssssss>in one corner the wallpaper be peel , there be scuff mark by the door nothing major but over all a little lack lustre .<ssssss>they be in the process of renovate all room in the alli tower right now -lrb- accord to thier website -rrb- and they be schedule to be finish by feb 2006 .<ssssss>another thing that bother I about the room be the housekeeping .<ssssss>they do a fine job clean the room but we have 4 people in the room .<ssssss>when we ask to have we towel change most time they only give we 3 bath towel so someone would have to use a just use wet towel .<ssssss>after 2 kid spend a day at the beach yuck !<ssssss>also , they put chocolate on the pillow during turndown service .<ssssss>i always look forward to retire to the room at night and have that little treat , but when you have 2 child and they only give you 2 chocolate the kid get the chocolate and the parent get nothing .<ssssss>i would ask for 4 chocolate and 4 bath towel , sometimes they would leave they for we , most time not .<ssssss>it become a real pain call housekeeping for a extra bath towel .<ssssss>it be the little thing that make service outstanding.alli tower in general : overall the alli tower be great .<ssssss>the front desk service be quite good .<ssssss>a couple time when we review we account on the tv we find a couple of discrepancy in we account , but they be take care of immediately .<ssssss>the concierge be quite knowledgable and help we many time .<ssssss>we love the hors d'oeuvre upstairs by the pool , they have quite a good selection .<ssssss>we be not expect much when we go on we first night and be very pleasantly surprised .<ssssss>they have a good selection of fruit and veggy with dip , and hot food such as chicken skewer as well .<ssssss>it be something that we look forward too , every evening we would buy a drink -lrb- lava flow be really good and all drink be top with orchid -rrb- and have hors d'oeuvre while we watch the hula show down by the pool or just stare out over the ocean .<ssssss>the pool at the alli tower be just for the guest in that tower .<ssssss>it be open later -lrb- till 8pm -rrb- than the super pool so it be nice for a evening swim and there be a hot tub in one corner that overlook the ocean .<ssssss>one night the 4 of we sit up in the hot tub , no one else be there and we watch fire eater put on a show down on the beach .<ssssss>it be pure heaven.the resort : the resort be a very beautiful place .<ssssss>the garden and the fish pond be incredible .<ssssss>the penguin and flamingo keep the kid interested .<ssssss>the super pool be quite cold and you have to be there very early to get a chair .<ssssss>i also do not like the idea that we have to pay through the nose for beach chair and umbrella .<ssssss>i think it be $ 20/umbrella and $ 20/chair , or something like that per day .<ssssss>it should not cost $ 100 to get beach chair at the resort .<ssssss>the food on the resort be good , we especially like the breakfast buffet at the rainbow lanai .<ssssss>get there early though or you will have to wait for a table , everyone else like the breakfast there too .<ssssss>another good place to eat be round table pizza , the pizza be excellent and quite cheap .<ssssss>$ 25.00 get you a large pizza smother in topping , try the hawaiian , no one do it better .<ssssss>when we arrive in we cab from the airport we be remove we luggage and get yell at for the cab be in the way even though i do not feel that he be .<ssssss>i also want to know why we be get ask , no , yell at to move we cab , perhaps some guest might need to be check in at the resort ?<ssssss>the resort can be a spendy place but if you carefully prepare and do not get too lure in by the shop you can keep you cost down .<ssssss>another thing , they do cater to the japanese tourist there .<ssssss>they have these special open air tram that we try to get on once but be tell they be private .<ssssss>do not understand that since it be stop at the bus stop and it be full of japanese tourist .<ssssss>most thing be within walk distance anyway .<ssssss>downtown be within walk distance , it be about a 10 minute walk , try go along the beach boardwalk it be a nice walk .<ssssss>also ala moana mall be a close walk , about 10 min in the opposite direction .<ssssss>if you want do a lot of shopping that be the place to go.overall : the whole island be incredibly beautiful , and the resort match it .<ssssss>it be like they try to make the resort rival the beauty of the island .<ssssss>we rent a car for 8 day and explore every coast and every nook and cranny of the island .<ssssss>thing that we really like be pearl harbour , the polynesian cultural center , sea life park , and if you get a chance drive to the north shore .<ssssss>there be not alot to do on the north shore but it capture the essence of hawaii .<ssssss>you can sit on beautiful beach and watch the surfer , it be what i envision old oahu to be like .<ssssss>also go to matsumoto on the north shore for shave ice ,

1 1 1 5 2 1 1 -1		art be great but room poorly maintain and staff unfriendly we arrive after have fly in from new zealand so be tired and look forward to check in to the hotel .<ssssss>we be a couple of hour early and the room be not ready yet so we reluctantly leave we bag and go for a walk .<ssssss>on first impression , the hotel reception be funky but the girl behind the desk be quite surly - not at all welcome .<ssssss>we return to the hotel a couple of hour later to check into we room .<ssssss>we be look forward to a nice shower and a rest .<ssssss>the room have a very loud generator outside the window and the toilet break when my boyfriend flush it .<ssssss>when we phone reception about the broken toilet , they send someone to have a look but he be unable to fix it -lrb- do not seem to try very hard -rrb- .<ssssss>when i say that i be not very happy with my experience of the hotel so far and be consider go elsewhere , the receptionist do not seem concerned or make much effort to be helpful .<ssssss>she be go to move we to a room with a shared bathroom but after i insist that we want we own bathroom , we be move to another room which be not much better than the first .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny and run down with no room to move and it have a bath with a plastic shower curtain and a toilet .<ssssss>there be a grubby sink in the bedroom .<ssssss>at least this room do not have generator noise but when we try to open the window to get some air , the window would not stay open - we have to jam something in it .<ssssss>none of the power socket work .<ssssss>i have a adapter plug which i know have work in other place .<ssssss>when i ask reception if it be a problem that they be aware of , she say no and suggest that i go and buy another adapter plug.on the positive side ... the bed be fine - comfortable enough and with plain white bedding .<ssssss>the art be good .<ssssss>i do not think that just get artist to paint the wall be enough though - the room be in desperate need of renovation .<ssssss>ok , it be not overly expensive but i would still expect something better than what i get for that price.the building itself be very old and quite beautiful .<ssssss>the location -lrb- in the french quarter -rrb- be great with some fantastic french restaurant and cafe nearby .<ssssss>with a little renovation and some friendly service , this hotel could be great .<ssssss>
4 3 2 3 3 5 4 -1		excellent service , friendly staff i can not fault the staff and service that we receive at this hotel , everyone be so friendly and nothing be too much for them.the room be small but be equip with everything you need include a fridge and reception will provide hairdryer , iron etc on request.i find the room we have to be a bit noisy as we be on the street side as we request a balcony and it be a very busy road.please be advise that there be steep stair lead in to this hotel so it would not be suitable for anyone with walk difficulty but dont worry about have to drag you case up the stair as the staff be only too happy to do this.overall a great stay in a reasonably price hotel with great location -lrb- near dam square anne frank house -rrb- and only a short walk from central station .<ssssss>
3 2 2 3 3 5 5 -1		pay attention to you instinct while plan we honeymoon in vieque , i insist that at least two night be spend at hix island house .<ssssss>it seem perfect for usâtranquility , privacy , nature , and beautiful design .<ssssss>the first afternoon be great .<ssssss>brenda be helpful and quickly make reservation for dinner at chez shack and a bio bay tour the next day .<ssssss>we spend a few hour lounge by the pool after the beach and then have wine , cheese and cracker in we âroomâ ?<ssssss>-lrb- the studio -rrb- .<ssssss>lizard sun themselves on we balcony and bird fly in and out .<ssssss>it be very peaceful and unlike anything weâd ever do before .<ssssss>however , the night change everything .<ssssss>it would have be too dark and steep to walk back from nearby chez shack , so we have to drive .<ssssss>bug flit around we as we play scrabble by candlelight .<ssssss>it rain on and off and be very hot , despite the overhead fan .<ssssss>i toss and turn and only sleep a few hour for fear of disturb the mosquito net and get eat alive while we sleep .<ssssss>the next morning we try to make french toast with the homemade bread , while fight off a combination of mosquito , fly , rain , and powerful wind .<ssssss>-lrb- iâm sure this would have be easier have it not be the rainy season . -rrb-<ssssss>i feel guilty admit to my husband that i hadnât do enough soul search and that hix wasnât what i have expect .<ssssss>luckily , he be sweet enough to make everything okay .<ssssss>he talk to the lady at the reception desk and they be sympathetic .<ssssss>they refund we 75 % of the second nightâs stay and we check into hacienda tamarindoâa place that isnât stylish or cool , but we room have a amazing view of the ocean , private balcony and the option of keep out most of the bugs.although it be a interesting experience be at hix , i wouldnât call it romantic , because it be very difficult to relax .<ssssss>although i do love camping as a kid , it wasnât the right experience for we honeymoon .<ssssss>i know there be many other out there who love hix and iâm not try to contradict themâsimply give we take .<ssssss>i hope this help those out there plan similar trip !<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 3 3 -1		great location the menzy sydney be very centrally located .<ssssss>right across the street be there train station and you could catch the bus right outside the door .<ssssss>we be within walk distance of both harbor .<ssssss>the room itself be a little dated but be sufficient for we need , the bathroom leave alot to be desire .<ssssss>we view be of another building .<ssssss>but because of the location , i would stay there again , easy access to everything .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 4 4 2		great position as the previous review say this property be begin to look a little tired around the edge a freshen upof the paint and proper cleaning of the shower grouting be really all that be required.it be very conveniently place for lot of restaurant , shop , ferry etc.taxi driver do not seem to know where it be -lrb- but then they also do not know where the sydney harbour bridge be !<ssssss>so what do that tell you !! -rrb-<ssssss>find staff to be very helpful , we be originally put in a 2nd floor harbour view room but we have very little view of the harbour as it be obscure by the maritime museum , i ask for a higher floor and this be agree immediately .<ssssss>we be then on the 8th floor and have fabulous view over darling harbour.would definately reccomend this hotel to anyone.an add bonus be the free wireless internet access we discover as we be right next to the ibis hotel , where this be include .<ssssss>wire broadband be available in the apartment but at a cost !!<ssssss>think the management should make free wireless available in the apartment as a whole , not only if you happen to be in close proximity to the ibis next door .<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 3 3 3 4		tack o rama i be write this from the hotel .<ssssss>i will come update it if there be need .<ssssss>my husband want to try somethong new and quirky for we friend 26th birthday -lrb- we usually stay at the mark hopkin -rrb- so we choose the hotel triton , because we have walk by and know its in a great location , and its a kimpton and weve stay at the hotel monaco in seattle many time ... so we get two celebrity suite i think they be $ 359 per night each .<ssssss>after view the room online , we request the king triton suite and the hagen daz suite ... so we get to the hotel at 11pm or so and check in , it be I my husband and one memmber of the other party .<ssssss>the guy be really nice and tell we all about where to eat and drink nearby , and the lobby be cute and they have rubber ducky ion the fountain .<ssssss>so the three of we and the hotel worker go up to we room -lrb- the other room come later -rrb- and we get in the king triton suite -lrb- supposedly the best room they have -rrb- and it reek like smoke ... and someone have put plastic wrap all over the smoke detector ... so he bring we air freshener and open the window -lrb- which look out on some weird wooden scary platform and other room -rrb- anywayz the room be beyond tacky -lrb- i have stay at a adult theme motel before ... and really it be better -rrb- there be mirror everywhere , and a bright red light in the tub room -lrb- also tub be small one person jacuzzi like the size youd have in you bathroom at home -rrb- .<ssssss>also as we walk down to meet the other person , we start to nitoce more and more how the whole hotel be so obviously a former crack motel that they try hard to make pretty ... sag floor , peel wallpaper and paint ... dirt in weird spot ... weird staircase ... so its like 1145 now and we friend have park in front of the hotel and be get out ... we all walk back in .<ssssss>no employee in sight , finally my husband search one out , and they check she in ... she have the hagen daz suite ... we go into check it out ... much better room than the kinf tritin suite ... much newer and much more care put in -lrb- still some uneven paint etc -rrb- have very cute fully stock -lrb- free -rrb- freezer ... the bed rattle tho every time you move even a bit ... definitely a nicer room though ... so she realize the pillow be all down and she need foam ... we take the elevator of hell -lrb- it randomly go to unrequested floor and stop -rrb- down to ask for some ... sorry we give they all away be tell .<ssssss>and that where we be so far ... more later ...<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 5 -1		grand old glamour this be a old-school , old-world hotel with slightly fading glamour , but great location , service , and amenity nontheless.we get a amazing price for this place , give the location -lrb- right on the square -rrb- and the room -lrb- huge , with a king bed the size of a trampoline , a bathtub big enough for two , and a seperate marble shower stall that could fit four comfortably -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be decorate in rich burgundy and gold , very old-school , very classic .<ssssss>the bathroom be enormous even for we standard -lrb- not to mention european standard -rrb- , and make we feel like we have a mini-spa in we room.room service be available 24 hour a day .<ssssss>staff be very polite and gracious .<ssssss>check-in and check-out take about 10 minute , which be slighly frustrating .<ssssss>they know they have a large hotel with many people come and go , they should staff the desk with more individual at peak time .<ssssss>this seem like a hotel for the older , gentried set .<ssssss>we see many people come in for the night right around the time we be leave .<ssssss>unlike with many european hotel , breakfast be * not * include with we room .<ssssss>-lrb- at the room rate we get , i could not blame they . -rrb-<ssssss>a enormous buffet be available , for a price .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 1 2 1 2		fawlty tower in the flesh now , before i get into this review i must set out the good point first .<ssssss>the location be superb , can not be question , and for this reason i must give the place credit .<ssssss>the bar be also fantastic , and be constantly buzz with a great atmosphere throughout we 4 night stay.however , the room , well they be simply disgusting .<ssssss>i sleep on a broken bed with a cushion for a pillow next to semen stain curtain .<ssssss>it stink and obviously have not be clean in month .<ssssss>we never even have the room service when we be there - this be a twin bed private bathroom room .<ssssss>as a group we have 3 of these room , each with they own problem , but all be filthy.ours have the semen curtain , another be so hot it be unbearable -lrb- even though the outside temperature be only 15 degree centigrade -rrb- , and the other have urine stain on the bathroom door which lead to the most dispicable shower i have ever see .<ssssss>you would need to be 2ft tall and about 6 stone in weight to even fit in the thing , it defy belief.yet to compund this , we have major problem even get to the room in the first place .<ssssss>we decide to use the lift , as we have suitcase , and obey the weight and person limit .<ssssss>two of we get out and go to wait at the bar for the other to drop off they bag .<ssssss>10 min go by and then i have a phone call - the other person be stick in the lift .<ssssss>they have activate the alarm , but it be a pathetic intermittent beep which could not be hear above the bar music where the staff reside , and in fact no one have realise they be stick .<ssssss>this be a major safety hazard , and when basil the owner be inform he decide to do nothing for about 5 min since he be busy .<ssssss>i be sorry but i think people trap in a lift should take priority.down to the bar the next morning , we be inform that we would have to move room for the final night , cause we unnecessary hasslethe guy be a nutter , clearly have no clue on how to run the place .<ssssss>it be revolting .<ssssss>however , the worst come the day after the holiday when i contract a illness due to the filth of the placemy advice , visit the bar , but do not stay in the dump<ssssss>
4 5 5 5 5 4 5 1		awesome i visit isabella for a destination wedding hold at villa montanya about a five minute walk down the beach from villa tropical .<ssssss>all i can say be we get the better deal .<ssssss>though the decor at villa tropical be a bit lack ; a lot lack , we view be spectacular .<ssssss>villa montanya 's accomodation be much nicer to look at , but most , if not all of the room have no view of the ocean .<ssssss>at villa tropical , the bed be very comfy , and i be not a good sleeper generally .<ssssss>every night i feel asleep to the sound of the wave .<ssssss>i cook breakfast and walk onto my porch where the ocean be practically underneath my foot .<ssssss>gorgeous view .<ssssss>each apartment have a five burner bbq on the deck , so we have a little bbq with friend from the wedding .<ssssss>snorkele and scuba diving be right at you foot , though it be important to ask you fellow beach goer where to go into the water .<ssssss>the area be line with sea urchin tuck into the rock , but once you establish the spot to go in it be great snorkeling .<ssssss>the owner be very gracious , and hook you up with anything you need .<ssssss>you can not beat the price for a view like we have .<ssssss>
2 3 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		good location excellent location , room be large and well set out .<ssssss>we stay there with family who be all on seperate floor , we have alot of trouble with the elevator from floor to floor , staff should have explain the security set up to we .<ssssss>one day there be only one elevator working and we wait for 30min as we be on top floor , this can happen anywhere but it take all day to fix .<ssssss>staff be extremely unhelpful , would not stay there again .<ssssss>
3 3 5 1 5 5 3 4		good hotel , poor location this be a good hotel ... .<ssssss>a bit corporate ... a bit business-ey , but a quality hotel nevertheless with all mod-con and good service .<ssssss>i pay extra for a harbour view room and it be definitely worth it .<ssssss>the room be massive and the floor to ceiling window give a sensational view over hong kong harbour.the one downer of the hotel be its location .<ssssss>i do not mind be kowloon-side , but it be at least a 30 minute walk to tsim sha tsuus .<ssssss>during the day there be a ferry from outside the hotel which go to central ... but this stop at about 8pm leave you reliant on taxi or the hotel 's own shuttle bus after then.so the hotel be lovely , but i be afraid the location -lrb- which they can not really do much about ! -rrb-<ssssss>would put a real question for I on whether i would recommend .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 2 4 4 4		be careful in room choice the hotel undergo a major overhaul about 2 year ago , however beware , there be some awful room with unrenovated bathroom .<ssssss>this be my 4th stay in a couple of year , and be the first time i have be give one of these room .<ssssss>the bedroom itself be update -lrb- funky modern glass furniture etc -rrb- , however the bathroom be a 70 's horror - its a very bizarre contrast .<ssssss>chip marble vanity top , wood frame mirror , brown stain toilet bowl , stain bathtub - ugh !!!<ssssss>the room have a really awful odor -lrb- not cigarette smoke - just really bad stale smell - maybe the bathroom ?? -rrb-<ssssss>ask reception for a room change that will be a extra $ 30 please .<ssssss>the room be so bad , it be worth it .<ssssss>strange though , i would never have a room like this before on the same corporate rate.i also use they pillow service , as i like a very firm pillow -lrb- bed have about 5 floppy pillow - nice to look at -rrb- .<ssssss>unfortunately , the pillow that be bring up smell really bad and i could not bear to use it -lrb- yes - there be a theme emerge here ... -rrb- .<ssssss>it smell of something like bad kitchen exhaust fume - i be not a psycho really - just two event that both happen to be relate to smells!otherwise the hotel be fine , expensive meal -lrb- both restaurant and room service -rrb- but lot of option nearby .<ssssss>
1 1 4 5 2 2 1 -1		service suck i stay in this 2-bedroom apartment for a week and i be no happy about the service at all .<ssssss>be it really 4-star hotel ???<ssssss>i strongly doubt it.first , the receptionist be not very helpful and they be not friendly at all .<ssssss>no smile when talk to you .<ssssss>it be like at the funeral or something.second , i rent a car and i want to get a car space in the hotel .<ssssss>all they do be to charge I $ 20 a day .<ssssss>they do not tell I where to park nor where the entrance for parking be .<ssssss>when i ask they , they just give I a look .<ssssss>like i should have know the answer .<ssssss>i be just a visitor !<ssssss>third , the a/c be not work at all .<ssssss>i call they the day i checkedin and a few time during my stay and all they say be that they would fix it soon .<ssssss>until the day i check out , which be a week after , nothing have do .<ssssss>they do not even provide I a fan.fourth , no sugar/coffee/tea be give after the second day .<ssssss>fifth , they give we dirty towel with brown stain !<ssssss>sixth , they only make the bed in the master room .<ssssss>seventh , the detergent be not replace .<ssssss>and many more ... i mean , the apartment be very comfortable and it get almost everything you may need during you stay but i just do not think it wasworth stay there for the service i get from they .<ssssss>just my experience after all .<ssssss>perhaps , it be all because of my race ?<ssssss>i do not know ...<ssssss>
4 3 3 4 5 3 5 3		friendly with little room perfect location for downtown shopping and art museum .<ssssss>bus 30 to fisherman wharf and the bart train stop -lrb- powell st. -rrb- be within a half block .<ssssss>nothing fancy and at time the street noise be a bit much , but i adjust to the small room and the noise after the first night .<ssssss>exceptionally friendly housekeeping staff .<ssssss>i will be back .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 4 3 4 2		great experience here but sf need to clean up area i stay for 6 night at the parc 55 .<ssssss>check in be relatively easy .<ssssss>i request a top floor but get floor 15 .<ssssss>room be relatively large with view out two side since it be on the end .<ssssss>room be clean and staff be acceptably friendly .<ssssss>be forewarn that they be construct a large building next door so the noise start pretty early .<ssssss>i use earplug so it do not bother I .<ssssss>lot of homeless all around but it still seem safe as they be harmless .<ssssss>just do not go very far to the immediate west from the hotel because that area be not safe .<ssssss>very convenient to cable car and subway -lrb- bart -rrb- .<ssssss>major disappointment be not the hotel but the amount of homeless beg in a major tourist area .<ssssss>sf leadership really need to clean up they act .<ssssss>very little police presence notice anywhere around the city and that be very disappointing .<ssssss>see more homeless beg on the 100 yard walk from the subway to the hotel than 2 day in nyc .<ssssss>not the parc 55 's fault though .<ssssss>i think eventually this will come back to bite tourism there .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		nice - but noisy have just return from barcelona , i must say that yes , this hotel be beautifully decorate but design be not everything !<ssssss>room have a cool ambience , lovely soft colour and nice furniture -lrb- the bed be great -rrb- but the lightning in bathroom be way too poor and why be there no hook for the towel in the bathroom ?<ssssss>the main problem , however , be the noise .<ssssss>noise from the neighbour , noise from door slam all the time , noise from the street .<ssssss>from the sound from the bathroom of the room next door , we could almost tell what we neighbour have have for supper!the staff be very helpful and friendly , speak very good english .<ssssss>and the free mineral water be a wonderful thing to have .<ssssss>the situation at the border of el bear and right next to the gothic quarter be perfect .<ssssss>all in all the hotel be good value for money.go , but bring earplug !<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 4 4 3 3		excellent new room book the newly renovate grand room because of the photo in the hotel website and it turn out nicer than its picture .<ssssss>we be give a ground floor unit next to a koi pond in the west village .<ssssss>we child have a wonderful time feed and play with the hundred of fish lurk just outside we balcony .<ssssss>the room and bathroom be cosy and spacious enough even with 2 adult and 2 child .<ssssss>the hotel be huge and the main pool be about 200m walk .<ssssss>however the surround balinese landscape with beautiful garden , pond , tree and flower make we walk really pleasant.the 3 pool just next to the beach with slide , waterpolo and warm jacuzzi be fun for all .<ssssss>shopping and dining at bali collection be only a 100m or 5 minute stroll .<ssssss>if you want to stay at nusa dua with child , i doubt any other hotel can beat grand hyatt .<ssssss>

1 1 2 3 4 3 2 -1		frankly bad in frankfurt this be a lovely hotel but have some severe problem .<ssssss>with any luck they be temporary but it be definitely not worth the inflated rate i be pay .<ssssss>save yourself a big headache and contact they before make a reservation to find out if they be finish with they renovation / remodel .<ssssss>the lobby be a nightmare and on my final day elevator be not work , make check out a real hassle!housekeeping be exceptionally noisy and if you be not a early riser -lrb- 7am -rrb- you will be disturb .<ssssss>i think this be actually due to the hip but impractical design of the bathroom -- the frosted glass door to the bathroom must be get slam into the tub to make such resonant booming sounds.the room interior be pleasant but small .<ssssss>the look be everything the w hotel in the we hope to be .<ssssss>the room i be in have a pants press and iron board mount in the closet , but the closet be not wide enough to actually iron a shirt .<ssssss>the creepy porter argue with I about this , but i still have to have a iron and board bring up to the room in order to press my clothes.room service be good .<ssssss>the food be adequate but inconsistent .<ssssss>sometimes good , sometimes barely average .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 3 1 1 -1		ruin we anniversary !!<ssssss>:o-lrb- we would like everyone to know that this anniversary weekend be completely ruin by the hotel and it be staff .<ssssss>how anyone stay there be beyond I with that kind of service and complete disregard for they guest well be .<ssssss>there be many thing that i have list that be completely the hotel fault and responsibility - i leave a comment card and information regard the concern we have in the comment box in the lobby .<ssssss>i will go to all site of reservation and let they know exactly what the hotel have do and not do and how it completely ruin we weekend .<ssssss>this weekend have be plan in advance and special request for a romantic anniversary be make and not deliver .<ssssss>instead we be treat with disrespect and discourtesy .<ssssss>not only do we not receive one apology for the hotel mishap but we be treat this terribly from the moment we step foot into the lobby to the time we check out this morning !<ssssss>* 11/14/08 arrive at hotel with itenerary in hand and the woman at the front desk do not have we reservation .<ssssss>* we be book in a deluxe view room with a king bed , and they have book all those and take that room away from we and give we a standard double queen room with a view that seem smaller !<ssssss>* once she find the reservation -lrb- 5 minute -rrb- she give we the two room key to room # 2520 * we have be drive a while and be thirsty so we go to the hotel bar on the 2nd floor = when we ask for the check the waitress state that we name be not in the computer and give we someone else 's name on that room number 2520 .<ssssss>* we walk up to we floor 25 and we room 2520 and when we try to open the room it would not allow we to .<ssssss>we be confuse and tire and have to go back downstairs to get a new room ??<ssssss>a new key ??<ssssss>* when we come back downstairs there be several people in line which we have to wait for 15 minute to get a key and new room .<ssssss>* when we be help the woman -lrb- a different one this time -rrb- do not really apologize and just say something that the original agent must have make a mistake and give we we new key to a new room # 2570 * when we finally get the right room number and room key we go up to we room there be absolutely nothing in the room that indicate that it be we anniversary or any special item leave for we to enjoy ... there be even no refridgerator !!<ssssss>it have be state in the original booking that it be we anniversary and to make we a more romantic weekend - but not one happy anniversary or anything !<ssssss>* i come down around 3am to talk with a manager because i figure there would be no wait at the front desk .<ssssss>the night manager say that i should mention my concern to the daytime manager and also mention that book with expedia you be not guarantee you original booking ... which i thought be completely absurd - should not the hotel take good care of every guest - no matter who make the reservation ???!?!!?!?<ssssss>* while stay on the 25th floor we get thirsty for a sprite - so i walk down the hall and put 2 dollar bill and one quarter -lrb- $ 2.25 -rrb- for a sierra mist out of the vend machine and the money be stick - so i call the front desk as refer by a hotel staff that notice this , i call and be rudely tell that i would have to come downstairs to the front desk and ask for a refund and you do not think that be sort of a inconvenience ??<ssssss>i would have buy a soda at the store if i have know there would have be such a problem !<ssssss>* for a evening of try to make a terrible weekend turn a key - we decide to stay in and get a bottle of red wine to enjoy while we watch the view .<ssssss>i call to have some kim crawford pinot noir , it be list in the menu in the room , i call room service and be tell that they do not have that wine but they have chalone pinot noir and that the bottle price be not list but that it would be $ 40.00 , when the bill come with the wine it be 55 dollar and be never inform what the $ 15.00 overcharge be for .<ssssss>overall i would never recommend this hotel to anyone and would give very bad review to where ever we can to let people know that we be guest but be make to feel like outcast at this parc 55 hotel !<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 2 2 3		have potential , but need much improvement this hotel need some work .<ssssss>a lot of work , actually .<ssssss>it be obvious they be try to do just that , but in the meantime , the room be very , very outdated .<ssssss>the furnishings and amenity be way behind what we have come to expect in a hotel at $ 400/night .<ssssss>the door , trim , air conditioning vent , balcony railing and plumbing fixture be all in really awful , outdated condition .<ssssss>they should have be update 10 year ago -- they be * well * beyond they prime .<ssssss>if you be accustom to see flat panel tv 's , contemporary furniture and duvet on the bed , this be definitely not the hotel for you.on the plus side , the bed be comfortable , the room be spacious and nicely arrange -lrb- other than the bathroom , which be the smallest hotel bathroom i have see in year . -rrb-<ssssss>the beach access be fantastic and the beach itself be very nice .<ssssss>the view from the oceanview room be not go to be beat .<ssssss>there be a few restaurant -lrb- ie : other hotel restaurant -rrb- within walk distance , which be a nice plus , and the restaurant in the hotel -lrb- with the exception of the downstairs breakfast restaurant -rrb- be nice.the worst part of this hotel be that they have we email address since the day i make the reservation several month ago and we be never notify about the pool renovation .<ssssss>that be really a unacceptable oversight .<ssssss>-lrb- and i be probably be generous in call this a ` oversight . ' -rrb-<ssssss>i can not even begin to imagine the disappointment this would have create have my stay there be a family vacation !<ssssss>until the pool be complete , i would be not recommend this hotel , unless you do not mind stay in a outdated room at a resort with no pool .<ssssss>even when the pool be complete , i would personally not stay here again unless the entire hotel be fully renovate .<ssssss>we debate between this hotel and the ritz-carlton , and there be no question that next time , that will be we choice .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 3 3		bed bug myself and my friend stay in this hotel in may 08 .<ssssss>we room -lrb- 101 -rrb- be small , the view be non-existent , and the room be hot .<ssssss>it be a last minute deal and be convenient for the city centre so we think it would be ok.after 3 night we be cover in bite - we initially think this be mosquito but it become clear that it be actually bed bug .<ssssss>there be blood stain on the sheet -lrb- we now realise from squashed bug -rrb- - we ask for they to be change , which they be , but it do not help the situation .<ssssss>we find a number of bug in the bed and there be also suspicious black splat against the wall.judging from the some of the other review , there be definitely a problem with insect at this hotel - but appear to be confine to certain rooms.we have both return to work with nasty red spot all over we face , neck and arm .<ssssss>it be not just the odd bite - we be cover - which suggest a serious infestation.please do not stay here .<ssssss>if you have already book and they try and give you room 101 - say no !<ssssss>
2 -1 3 5 2 5 2 -1		accept the cultural difference of the guest first !<ssssss>first of all you have to mention the staff here - they be superb , and nothing be too much of a problem .<ssssss>congratulation to all of they have to be mention .<ssssss>and they be the save grace at this hotel .<ssssss>i stay here for 2 week and have to say the hotel could be quiet , and offer itself to french tourist in the main who can be noisy and unwittingly annoying .<ssssss>spoil on a daily basis the calm that could be appreciate if they didnt clog the bar , get drunk -lrb- one drink seem to do it -rrb- and continuously flout the pool side regulation .<ssssss>and on one occasion this do result in a very violent confrontation between these guest and other .<ssssss>not a holiday memorable moment .<ssssss>they cater for large group who do take over the small bar area -lrb- which isnt 24 hr - it shut at midnight -rrb- and there be little escape from they if quiet be you requirement .<ssssss>that aside its a nice place to stay , on the beach afford a great view of the ocean and very cheap taxi 's to kuta , which be a must for clubber and good dining enthusiast alike.look out for the illegal money changer opposite the hotel , they operate with little aggression but can do magic trick with you money only paul daniel could worlk out .<ssssss>for those who dont appreciate average buffet food the retsuarant locally be a must , and very cheap .<ssssss>bumba balus be a must visit .<ssssss>and for $ 6 you can get shoe make in 24 hr that fit superbly as they be make to measure .<ssssss>there be many advantage to outweigh the arrogance of some fellow guests.overall great staff , average food , and if you lucky little noise , although i would guess that be not go to happen too often.would i stay here again ?<ssssss>no - the reason be state here , would i reccomend this hotel - yes - but beware of the potential for other with little or no manners spoil you quiet time .<ssssss>

2 2 1 5 3 4 4 -1		ugh - avoid !<ssssss>better place to be find in the same area !<ssssss>maybe this hotel be once a nice place to stay ... back in the 1960 's !<ssssss>it be old and it show .<ssssss>from the dreary drape to the clean but wear out bathroom .<ssssss>it be a embarassment to the hilton name , imo .<ssssss>it may be cheaper , but really , for $ 10 - $ 30/night more you can find a much better place to stay and still be close -lrb- if not closer -rrb- to bourbon street .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 5 3 4 3		mostly good here be the good : - very convenient location close to the t - nicely furnished room and nice decor throughout the hotel.-even though the hotel do not offer any official laundry service , the front desk staff accommodate we laundry need by get housekeeping to put a load on for we while we be out tour the city -lrb- for a $ 10 fee -rrb- .<ssssss>- the hotel accommodate my request to have a room on one of the two top floor so that there be less street noise.-the variety of television channel be huge.the bad : - the room be indeed very small , though this do not bother I all that much because boutique hotel in boston and new york tend to be small , so i expect it.-the breakfast offer downstairs be sad .<ssssss>hard-as-a-rock bagel and some bitter coffee do not really constitute breakfast in my mind .<ssssss>- the view from the room consist of a brick wall about four foot from the window.all in all , yes , i would stay there again consider it be very centrally located and very clean , and it be one of the only hotel i could find in downtown boston for under $ 200 a night .<ssssss>however , next time i would factor in the cost of eat breakfast out each morning when compare price .<ssssss>
2 3 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		not so ` hilton ' like we spend only 2 night at this hotel , sort of a mini vacation for my daughter to enjoy the water park area .<ssssss>the first room we be give be a handicapped room -lrb- we be not handicapped but the room be very spacious !!! -rrb-<ssssss>, and it have no seal on part of the door , so bug could come right in , you could see a lot of light on the bottom of the door .<ssssss>i notify the front desk and request a new room .<ssssss>we be move to a different room , but realize it have the same problem .<ssssss>i do not want to be a bother and request a third room , so we stay .<ssssss>also , the ceiling on the patio appear to be moldy , it have black splotch all over it .<ssssss>someone from housekeeping come in we room without knock right after we get settle in and be get ready to go swimming .<ssssss>my daughter be completely naked put on sunscreen in the front room -lrb- have a room with a front room near the main door and a bedroom -rrb- .<ssssss>this lady just stand there with the door wide open try to hold a conversation with I while my child be stand there naked .<ssssss>she do not leave until i tell she to get out !!<ssssss>that be the worst experience for my daughter .<ssssss>she be so embarrassed !<ssssss>the bathroom sink be nearly impossible to turn off and it drip constantly if you do not use all of you strength to turn it off .<ssssss>then we dinner at hole in the wall be so burned , it be not edible .<ssssss>not to mention i ask for no onion and no pepper , i get both , but i do not get the tomato that be suppose to come with it .<ssssss>the manager be great about that , he do not charge we for the meal and give we dessert for free too .<ssssss>that be nice and we other meal there be fine .<ssssss>i have a magnetic organ donor ribbon steal off my car while we be there .<ssssss>room service take about a hour to deliver and the quality of food be poor .<ssssss>the salad actually make I sick .<ssssss>they also have some sort of sport team there and the kid be run all over the hotel very late .<ssssss>they be knock on door and be very loud .<ssssss>i call the front desk and they say they would put a stop to it .<ssssss>they do not .<ssssss>the final straw for I be the salon .<ssssss>i go to toca sierra salon for highlight .<ssssss>the next day , it be not even noticeable that i have it do .<ssssss>they use too dark of a color , so i spend another hour there get it re-done .<ssssss>include tip , i spend $ 100 , and it be not a good job .<ssssss>it be so far from the root , it look like i need to have it re-done already , and i do .<ssssss>after return home , i contact the salon manager .<ssssss>she be awesome about the whole situation and be refund I all of what i spend and send a certificate for a free massage .<ssssss>i have yet to hear back from the hotel manager in order to get the hotel-related matter resolve , but at least the salon be quick to respond and be very helpful in the situation i encounter .<ssssss>i guess if you do choose this hotel , make sure you door be lock at all time and check the room they give you top to bottom before you unpack and ask for a different room if you see a problem .<ssssss>do not be afraid to speak up , it help the hotel to address issue for future guest ' comfort too !<ssssss>hope this help you .<ssssss>
3 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		definitely not perfect !<ssssss>far from it !<ssssss>i will try to make this as neutral and unbiased as possible .<ssssss>we stay there for three nights.good thing about the grand hyatt singapore - upgrade we two room to grand deluxe - very friendly and efficient reception staff - large room , good toiletries and towel - very good buffet breakfast selection - with very attentive staff - porterage and concierge service efficient - hotel guest have priority for taxi - the queue can get quite long at peak hour - we be charge for a phone call and minibar consumption that we never make - once this be raise the staff erase the record immediately .<ssssss>how the charge occur be a mystery to I !<ssssss>- the gym sauna be well equip and cleanbad thing about the grand hyatt singapore - we cordless phone do not work - this be report on the first day but the phone remain non-functional for all 4 day -lrb- and 3 night -rrb- of we trip .<ssssss>it keep on flash and the button do not work !<ssssss>- the pillow cover have hole ... .<ssssss>not on the edges/sides but right in the middle !<ssssss>- the showerhead be crack and basically non-functional - water be dribble out ... .<ssssss>again this be raise but nothing be doneconclusion - definitely not the best hotel we have stay in - but still quite good consider the price pay and the room upgrade .<ssssss>- the staff be great - it appear that it be the hardware that need work do -lrb- the phone , shower , pillowcase -rrb- .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 4 5 3 4		a experience design to suck you wallet dry my wife and i be hilton diamond hhonor member ; we have stay at this property both in its former life and as a purpose-built new hilton .<ssssss>as it be right on the airport , the property have one huge advantage : location.making we reservation be a snap on hilton 's website .<ssssss>check-in be even easier as we check in and receive we room assignment on-line ; from the time we walk through the front door to cross the threshold of we room , not more than five minute pass .<ssssss>room - even room at the end of hallways/corner room be fairly small , more in line with what one would find in a newer european hilton .<ssssss>room be well furnished and we king bed have a wonderful duvet .<ssssss>on the negative side , the room hvac air-flow be minimal and cool the room take longer than expected.our problem with this property be that aside from the fairly steep room rate , everything at this hotel be design to extract additional fee and cost from guest .<ssssss>let 's start with overnight parking : we $ 30 -lrb- plus tip every time to arrive/depart -rrb- .<ssssss>want to have internet access ?<ssssss>that will be at least we $ 10 .<ssssss>you have pay the additional cost of upgrade to the executive floor so you will have access to the lounge .<ssssss>in europe , breakfast , snack , and evening treat be all complimentary together with beer , wine , and all spirit .<ssssss>free .<ssssss>no cost .<ssssss>include in the cost of pay for a room on the executive floor .<ssssss>oh , no .<ssssss>but not at this hilton .<ssssss>my wife be bill for more than we $ 10 for a single -lrb- small -rrb- glass of a routine merlot .<ssssss>i could go on and on , but by now you have the idea .<ssssss>i suppose it be all about yield-management and enhance the bottom line , but frankly there be a limit on what we will tolerate by way of be nickle and dimed .<ssssss>so , before we commit to another stay here , we be go to evaluate we other nearby hilton family option here at boston logan : the close-by embassy suites.if you choose to stay here , fine , it be a nice property .<ssssss>but watch you wallet .<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 1 2 3 -1		not great stay here for 3 night base on traveller review .<ssssss>kind of disappointing .<ssssss>staff be friendly but only if you agree to everything they provide .<ssssss>book the room 3 month ago and request a non smoking room canal view .<ssssss>check in and i can understand no canal view but they give we a tiny wear out , smoking room in the basement .<ssssss>the room stunk and the lady be really upset when i request a non smoking room at least above basement level .<ssssss>compare to the basement i be happy with the new room despite mould in bathroom and everything extremely fray and wear .<ssssss>she say they be busy but reluctantly move we to a upper floor .<ssssss>i can see they be busy but the be not full and they save the nicer room , canal view to tempt the walk in client -lrb- happen to hear this conversation as i walk past front desk -rrb- .<ssssss>screw up the safe -lrb- ridicuously complex instruction -rrb- and after the room change the lady really get upset when she have to open the room safe for I .<ssssss>i notice each time i be in the lobby someone be ask to have they room safe open - be not just I as she would have I believe -lrb- another guest show sympathy after she scold I out and say the same thing happen to they -rrb- .<ssssss>other staff be much friendlier .<ssssss>it be not the canal house experience i have hope for .<ssssss>next time i will look for picture of the room .<ssssss>there be a good reason why there picture just show thing like the number on the door .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 3 1 2 3		awful service at the grand palladium punta cana my husband and i and two child stay at the grand palladium punta cana the 3rd week of april .<ssssss>we have travel to different country -lrb- mostly in the carribean -rrb- in the past and we like punta cana because it be very affordable compare to other place like barbado , st-lucia and the bahama .<ssssss>by the way , this be we sixth trip to punta cana in the last 4 year , so we be able to compare the palladium with other punta cana resorts.in term of quality of service for the price we pay , the palladium be a bit more affordable than other 4 and 5 star hotel .<ssssss>but , you do get what you pay for .<ssssss>and this be quite obvious start with we arrival .<ssssss>the reception staff be all very rude and do not seem to care about we at all .<ssssss>at one point , in my best spanish , i ask the reception supervisor where the washroom be and he do not even have the decency to acknowledge I but just rudely raise he arm and gesture to he right -lrb- i be suppose to guess that the washroom be at the end of the hallway towards the back of reception . -rrb-<ssssss>we also have a few minor problem with we room which could have be easily resolve , but we be disappointed once again with the reception staff 's attitude -lrb- one staff practically laugh in we face when we ask about change a light bulb that be burnt -rrb- .<ssssss>ok , enough complain about the reception staff .<ssssss>now for the rest of the hotel , the accommodation be ok .<ssssss>the room be clean but outdated .<ssssss>the bed cover be soil and we find mold on they , but the sheet be clean .<ssssss>but we do not go to punta cana for the room , but rather for the beach .<ssssss>the maid seem to be very nice and always say a cheery hola or bueno dia .<ssssss>this be probably one of the most pleasant part of we vacation !<ssssss>the food at the restaurant be ok for the most part , but we become sick on we last day , despite be careful with what we eat .<ssssss>but i do believe that this can happen anywhere we travel and it may not be entirely a problem with the hotel itself , but rather just we immune and digestive system react to the different food .<ssssss>also , the service in the restaurant be good on some day , and really bad on other so it be pretty inconsistent , despite the -lrb- generous -rrb- tip we give regularly.as for the beach , well , that be the best part !<ssssss>it be totally awesome like the rest of the other punta cana resort ' beach .<ssssss>however , it be not as wide as other resort ' so , as some people have comment before , you have to get up very early to find a good spot or even find a chair .<ssssss>overall , if i allow myself to compare the grand palladium with other punta cana resort where we have stay -lrb- like the majestic , iberostar bavaro , the excellence and the riu palace , all of which i would rate as strong 4 and 5 star for they service , food , accommodation and beach -rrb- , the grand palladium , however , get only a 1 star rating .<ssssss>but , we would have give it a good 3 star if it have not be for the rude and negligent service at the reception .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 1 3 1 -1		very disappointing i be a active participant on trip advisor .<ssssss>my husband and i do quite a bit of travel for business and pleasure and we never hesitate to rely on trip advisor 's review .<ssssss>the review be usually accurate about the hotel we have stay in .<ssssss>at the time we make we reservation at the fita hotel it be list as # 5 on trip advisor for hotel in amsterdam .<ssssss>unfortunately after spend four night at the fita , we do not share the high esteem this hotel have received.the best thing about the fita hotel be the location .<ssssss>the hotel be in the museum district and one block away from the ritziest shopping street in amsterdam .<ssssss>it be a quiet , convenient and safe neighborhood.upon arrive at the fita hotel we be greet by roel , one of the worker who be very friendly and show we we room .<ssssss>during the rest of we stay , we do not see anyone at the front desk , it be always desert .<ssssss>it would have be nice at time to see someone at the front desk to ask some simple question .<ssssss>in fact , we need walk direction to a local restaurant to meet a friend and my husband call the number on the in-room information card .<ssssss>the man who answer the phone act like he be be disturb at 7:00 pm .<ssssss>when my husband say to he , how be you do ?<ssssss>he reply , i be tired .<ssssss>not very friendly.the only time you do see any staff be at breakfast .<ssssss>the breakfast be adequate .<ssssss>fresh squeeze orange juice , egg , bacon , cheese , roll , and yogurt with fruit .<ssssss>breakfast be serve until 10:00 be on weekend and until 9:30 be on weekday .<ssssss>since we arrive on a saturday evening all we be tell by roel breakfast be from 8:00 -10:00 , so on monday morning we show up at 9:45 am and be greet sorry , you miss breakfast .<ssssss>we explain we be not tell it end at 9:30 be on the weekday , and they sorry and we leave without breakfast.the worst part about the fita hotel be the cleanliness of the room while we be stay there .<ssssss>we garbage be not empty everyday .<ssssss>along with the garbage can be break and we tell they about it and it be not fix or replace .<ssssss>the worst be we soil bed linen be not change for three straight day .<ssssss>this be inexcusable shameful and should be a embarrassement to the hotel.overall at 140 euro a night the fita hotel be a total disappointment .<ssssss>i guess you be pay for the location because you be certainly not pay for the friendliness , the food and definitely not the cleanliness of the hotel .<ssssss>next time , we will choose a different hotel .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 4 3 3 -1		such great potential ... i stay here feb-2008 for 2 day .<ssssss>it cost $ 240 a night but with the extra charge for pay with amex - it cost a extra $ 20 a night .<ssssss>however the staff do warn about that on day 1 - so if i want to i could have pay with cash to avoid it , however i do not have $ 500 spare cash.none of the taxi driver know where the hotel be .<ssssss>i would suggest say to they it be just past the four season because they all know where that is.what strike I immediately be what a enormous shame that they do not use the restaurant .<ssssss>it be on the ground floor - with pass trade from the street - they would make a fortune on it!this be not a place for unwell , unfit or disabled people .<ssssss>the stair up to reception be rather steep quite narrow .<ssssss>i find it a little bit hard to get my small suitcase up it .<ssssss>then once you check in - there be another long stairway .<ssssss>for I this be not a problem because i be young and reasonably fit.my room be # 14 -lrb- en-suite -rrb- , which be as far away from the stairs/corridors as you can get .<ssssss>the window face the police station next door .<ssssss>it be a good size room , have tv , hair-dryer , iron/ironing board , kettle.the room itself be in need of some tlc .<ssssss>you could tell the staff do everything they could to get the room as spotless as humanly possible .<ssssss>however you could see the paint buckle look fade the absence of a fan in the bathroom have cause mould in the past -lrb- however the staff scrub it with bleach every day so it be not actually any mould there anymore -rrb- .<ssssss>the bed be comfy clean .<ssssss>the touch of chock on the pillow every day be sweet.i could not get the a/c to work -lrb- i could get it to turn on but it just wouldnât go cold -rrb- , but there be a ceiling fan to take the worst of the heat .<ssssss>the location be superb , lot of pub , restaurant , the harbour bridge , opera house all within a very short walk.however the 2 reason i probably would not stay there again be that i think it be quite a bit to pay $ 240 a night but the real killer be the door .<ssssss>each door be pull shut to lock -lrb- ie there be no handle to do this without noise -rrb- .<ssssss>on the second night , the people in the room opposite I have no respect .<ssssss>every time they leave the room they would slam it shut .<ssssss>it be as loud as if it be my own door .<ssssss>at 2am one of they go to the toilet -lrb- that room be share bath -rrb- and again slam the door hard enough to wake I up .<ssssss>now imagine a pair of party people stay next door = no sleep at all .<ssssss>i can only imagine how noisy it would be to stay in one of the room of the main corridor.this place could be such a winner if it be just fix up a bit .<ssssss>

1 1 3 3 3 1 1 -1		do not waste you money - this ` hotel ' be a joke !!<ssssss>despite read previous review regard problem with check into this hotel i decide to stick with my booking at the bilderberg and make my own mind up.i should not have bother .<ssssss>we also arrive into reception where we be tell by the receptionist that we 3 night reservation be actually in they sister hotel which be located back towards the airport .<ssssss>i have my booking confirmation but it would appear that this be not worth the paper its write on !!<ssssss>we be tell that all reservation go through a central reservation book system that do not stop accept booking even though the hotel be full .<ssssss>i book this hotel in july yet hear nothing about it be overbook .<ssssss>to say we be very upset be put it mild .<ssssss>we ask to speak to the manager who explain -lrb- to make thing worse ! -rrb-<ssssss>that they have a large group arrive later that day , and in order to accomodate they , we have to be move to the other hotel !<ssssss>a hour later into we first afternoon in amsterdam and they can still not see really what we problem be !!!<ssssss>we be give 2 option by the manager :1 .<ssssss>they would try and check out availability at other hotel in the area or ,2 .<ssssss>if we would agree to move to they sister hotel for friday night and come back for the follow 2 night they would upgrade we room .<ssssss>i fully believe that have we not create such a fuss , we would have be send to the other hotel for the 3 night .<ssssss>we do not see we have much of a choice so we wait for another taxi to bring we back the way we come , to check into another hotel for 1 night .<ssssss>at this stage the afternoon be lost.i ask the manager do he think this system of booking be acceptable and he agree that it be not but they simply do not have a room for we until the large group leave on saturday .<ssssss>we both really get the impression that this be a fairly regular occurance at this hotel and we be absolutely disgusted at the way they conduct business.also , if you book a non-smoking room do not think you will be in a smoke free floor .<ssssss>we be on the first floor where the room be non-smoking however both night we arrive back to we room , we find fellow guest sit on the stairway smoking outside we room .<ssssss>would i recommend this hotel ?<ssssss>never !<ssssss>this place make faulty tower look good !<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 4 1 1 2		convert from another hotel - need more work this hotel be convert from another hotel brand within the last 18 -24 month or so .<ssssss>however , it do not feel like a westin - from the rude front desk staff to the lack of helpful doorman , the service at this westin be really lack and not up to par with other westin - i suspect this be one of those licensed property and not under the direct control of starwood .<ssssss>this be reflect in the standard of service which be low .<ssssss>the room be ok - i be on a high floor as a starwood platinum .<ssssss>lcd tv in the room , nice bed , and individual coffee maker be nice .<ssssss>bathroom be small , and wireless internet be always weak signal the entire time , and it keep disconnect .<ssssss>when you pay $ 14 or so , you expect that the signal be strong and that it doesnt keep drop you .<ssssss>i have to ask for the toiletries to be replace since the maid didnt replenish shampoo or shower gel .<ssssss>room service menu be limited and expensive - plenty of nearby restaurant thankfully .<ssssss>location of the hotel be great as long as you dont expect the staff to go out of its way to help you .<ssssss>have already change my future reservation for san francisco to stay elsewhere .<ssssss>
3 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		ideal location , but tiny room !<ssssss>like everyone say , the hotel be very centrally located .<ssssss>we be great by friendly staff at the reception with a offer of free wine .<ssssss>the room : look back , we should have ask for a room with a view -lrb- after have just read the other review here -rrb- .<ssssss>i think because we do not have any particulars , they give we the smallest room they have that face a airshaft .<ssssss>it be somewhat bitter for we because we have a huge room in madrid for a third cheaper in price per night , but we deal with it .<ssssss>the space in room 308 be so tiny that only one person can walk around the double bed at any time without throw the other person onto the bed !<ssssss>-lrb- i feel like we be in a ship cabin . -rrb-<ssssss>so if you be consider stay here , do not ask for room end in 8 or 9 -lrb- which be the smallest room in the hotel , accord to they detailed emergency exit floor plan -rrb- .<ssssss>the breakfast : this be the second highlight of the hotel , after the location .<ssssss>it be a great spread fill with a variety of sliced fruit , hot dish , cold cut , cheese , and pastry .<ssssss>i really do not expect anything like this in any hotel , quite frankly !<ssssss>the dining room be also quite nice , with view out onto the plaza .<ssssss>to sum up , get that tiny room be a toss-up upon check-in .<ssssss>we could have later complain and ask for a larger room if any be available , but choose not to .<ssssss>everything else about the hotel be great , so in the end , they cancel out the tiny room factor -lrb- really , how much time be you go to spend in it anyway ? -rrb-<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 5 2 2 3		totally overrated there be a myriad of little thing that make we stay at this hotel forgettable and irritating .<ssssss>we stay here along with a few other people and each of we independently have similar problem with we the hotel and the staff .<ssssss>to start , the room be not ready until well after the time they say it would be available .<ssssss>the room themselves be fine , but the air conditioning fail sometime around 1 be leave the room stuffy until 5ish .<ssssss>although there be internet , the desk be not set up for business travel , have no laptop-accessible outlet .<ssssss>also , the room card key repeatedly fail , force we to trek back down to the front desk to ask for new key .<ssssss>the front desk seem perpetually unsurprised and unconcerned about this ; we never receive a apology for the inconvenience .<ssssss>also , we ask the front desk to arrange a car service for we on the second night of we stay .<ssssss>after take down the information and the time they promptly forget to actually call and make the arrangement .<ssssss>finally , they lose we friend 's rental car in the valet .<ssssss>after give they she ticket , they promptly return with the wrong car .<ssssss>it take they over half a hour to find the right car .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 2 1 1 1		bad attitude , wrong information , go somewhere else !<ssssss>i choose this hotel after read the review by lonely planet 's -lrb- 2006 -rrb- and this site .<ssssss>the only good thing about this hotel be it be location - smack in the middle of old florence .<ssssss>we order a superior double room with breakfast for three night .<ssssss>arrive at the hotel with a car be complicate due to the street layout of old florence .<ssssss>the gp be not helpful as where direction from local .<ssssss>when i call the hotel they where uncooperative on the phone .<ssssss>when we get there we realize we have to take the baggage to the fourth floor of the building in a small , old , smelly elevator .<ssssss>we then receive a small , dark , dump room look at one of the inner courtyard .<ssssss>the bed be two single bed , the bathroom small and smelly and the toilet seat break .<ssssss>the tv set be the size of my cell phone screen and the cupboard have no shelf .<ssssss>when we ask for another room with double bed and a normal cupboard and bathroom we recieve a hostile response .<ssssss>they tell we all the room be the same and that they have no double bed in the establishment and that we should use the extra bed for put we cloth on .<ssssss>we be show two other even smaller room at same condition so we stay in ours .<ssssss>the breakfast be a joke - heated coffee , factory croissant .<ssssss>a shame for a italian to even look at those .<ssssss>when we contact we travel agent -lrb- who call the owner -rrb- we recieve the owner 's response - the bathroom be great , they do not like we other room , i do not see the problem.the worst thing about pendinus be the attitude we receive from the stuff and the owner .<ssssss>i could probably stay in stable if someone smile at I and try to make I comfortable.for the 120 euro per night + 25 euro parking you be better off stay at any other hotel in the area .<ssssss>
4 4 2 5 3 5 4 4		great location , staff , bed , so-so room stay here for the location .<ssssss>which be excellent .<ssssss>next door to convention center , around the corner from pacific plaza mall .<ssssss>10 short block to pike place , 5 to capitol hill .<ssssss>the room i end up with be extremely small , i be alone so it work out , if there would have be two of we it would have be challenge .<ssssss>the room be on the 8th floor face the court yard which make for no noise but be interesting to see the other high rise residential surround the courtyard , we could all look into each other window , kind of disturbing and at the same time intriquing , i have to remind myself not to be rude and watch people eat or watch tv.the hotel be undergo a name change and will be undergo severe renovation which be much need since it be in a upscale area , of course hwne they get do it will probably double the price of about $ 100 which i pay .<ssssss>scedule be to be do by summer of 2007 .<ssssss>i would definately stay here again but probably spring for the suite rather than the standard room .<ssssss>also parking be $ 21/day , kind of steep , but the internet be free , and even if it wasnt there be enough unsecure wifus network in the area to not worry about it if they do charge.a decent experience overall , now that i know what to expect .<ssssss>

3 5 3 5 5 2 2 2		great location , great price i spend three night at the charlesmark and agree with many of the previous reviewer : the location and price can not be beat.the main purpose of my trip to boston be shopping , and the location of the charlesmark in the back bay neighborhood , just a block off newbury and close to copley place , be ideal .<ssssss>additionally , the t stop just down the street make get around the rest of the city very easy .<ssssss>the price be also at least $ 100 cheaper than anything else i be able to find in the neighborhood.other reviewer have rave about the friendly and attentive staff , but unfortunately this be not my experience .<ssssss>i arrive a couple hour before the check-in time , and my room be not yet ready , which i be expect .<ssssss>i think the guy man the desk be the same another review describe as indifferent , and i agree ; he be not exactly rude , but he also be not very helpful .<ssssss>anyway , when i come back later close to the official check-in time , my room be ready , and my bag have already be bring up .<ssssss>by then , someone new be at the desk to actually check I in , and she be much more pleasant but still do not give I any information about the room , hotel , etc. for example , have i not read here that breakfast be provide in the lobby , i never would have know , as she do not tell I and nothing in the guest information in the room mention it -lrb- and it be serve in the upper lobby , tuck away from the elevator and flow of traffic -rrb- .<ssssss>i overheard another guest checking in later during my stay , and she get a full spiel about breakfast , internet , etc. also , during my four-day stay , i could hardly get anyone at the desk to look up , much less say hello , during my various coming and goings.i have a room on the sixth floor , and the view out the big window be actually quite nice .<ssssss>the room be quite small by american standard but perfect for my need -lrb- and not unexpected after read previous review here -rrb- .<ssssss>the directtv and radio be nice , as be the complimentary water .<ssssss>overall , though , the room i have could use some tlc .<ssssss>the carpet in the bedroom be loose along one wall , especially outside the bathroom door , and cause I to catch my toe a time or two .<ssssss>a light bulb be out in the bathroom -lrb- and be not replace during my stay -rrb- , and a dial on the wall that i assume be volume control for the sound system do not work .<ssssss>the room have a cordless phone , but the battery in the handset need replacement , mean all call have to be quick to avoid be cut off when the battery die .<ssssss>the hotel also have free wireless internet access , but the signal be so weak in my room that it be essentially useless .<ssssss>and oddly , the room have a folding chair -lrb- not sure why -rrb- in the closet/cupboard but no suitcase stand , which would have be much more convenient than the floor.other small thing would really make a big difference : replace the thin blanket and bedspread with a nice duvet .<ssssss>get rid of the vcr -lrb- who need it when there be directtv ? -rrb-<ssssss>, and replace the old tv with a lcd on a swing arm to make the awkwardly high position more easy to adjust and view .<ssssss>add a programmable thermostat so that the fan be not constantly run .<ssssss>keep a better eye on the breakfast room so that thing be well stock and the table be not dirty and full of trash.overall , the hotel be good but not great .<ssssss>it really be so close to be fantastic that the small thing -lrb- and unfortunately there be many that really add up -rrb- take away from what could have be a perfect experience .<ssssss>i would definitely consider return , though , mostly because of the unbeatable location and price .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 2 3 1 1		avoid this place !<ssssss>we stay here for a business conference ; the lodging be arrange by we corporate travel agent .<ssssss>when we arrive we be pleasantly surprised , the lobby be attractive and the reception be nice if a bit inexperienced .<ssssss>when we arrive at what be suppose to be a deluxe non-smoking room -lrb- confirm well in advance by both my self and we travel agent , and again at check-in -rrb- , it be tiny , dingy , and smell of stale smoke and mold .<ssssss>the window would not open so we ask for another room .<ssssss>they offer we a upgrade for $ 50 to a better room with a balcony , and we agree .<ssssss>the -lrb- larger -rrb- upgrade room also smell of smoke but we could open the french door so it be much better .<ssssss>when we try to call down to request robe we notice that the phone be not work .<ssssss>i dial the hotel number from my cell and report the problem ; i be tell it would be fix immediately .<ssssss>i have to speak with the concierge about something so i ask to be transfer ; the call be drop and i have to redial the hotel on my cell .<ssssss>next i go to iron my husband slacks for a business event that evening .<ssssss>the iron begin spew out white liquid , which raise a welt-like mark on the fabric .<ssssss>weird , i think , so i call from my cell again and ask for a iron .<ssssss>housekeeping come with the iron but no robe .<ssssss>when i go to finish iron the pants , i notice that the white liquid have eat small hole into the fabric where the raise welt have be .<ssssss>very weird .<ssssss>i call the front desk from my cell phone yet again and tell they about it .<ssssss>they send up a security guard , who agree that the slacks be very damage and tell I he would pass the info on to the hotel manager for resolution .<ssssss>then the engineer come shortly thereafter to replace the phone , but it still do not work .<ssssss>when i call the front desk yet again -lrb- from my cell -rrb- , the guy say that the hotel electrician have have a series of heart attack and nobody know how to fix any of the electrical wiring in the hotel .<ssssss>very scary for such a old hotel which be potentially a fire trap .<ssssss>my massage therapist -lrb- at a local spa -rrb- say that the royal sonesta be one of the few hotel that do not sustain damage from katrina , but that they be have a hard time get and keep good help because they be not put any money into the place to update and maintain it .<ssssss>the result be apparent .<ssssss>as a aside , we eat at both desire and begoue 's .<ssssss>the food be absolutely terrible at desire -lrb- my husband and i both get sick -rrb- and mediocre at begoue 's ; service be friendly but glacial at both.the upshot be , i never have a phone for the entire stay -lrb- which be certainly a security hazard -rrb- , i never do get any robe in my upgrade room , and i never get a resolution on the damage slacks .<ssssss>so when i go to check out i mention all of this to the front desk guy , who do not offer I any compensation for the pants -lrb- not to mention the inconvenience of have to call long distance from my cell at least a dozen time -rrb- ; he just give I the manager 's card and tell I to call during business hour .<ssssss>i do call mr. chuck davis , director of front office operation , several time this week , in addition to e-mail he .<ssssss>he have never respond .<ssssss>in my opinion -lrb- as a business traveler who spend upward of 100 night per year , mostly in 4 star hotel ; last night i be in the jw marriott in dc -rrb- this place be a disaster wait to happen .<ssssss>with poor management , insufficient maintenance , a deteriorate electrical system and nobody competent to repair it , this be not a safe place to stay in new orlean .<ssssss>
2 2 3 3 4 1 3 -1		not great the hotel be clean and central .<ssssss>the room be quite big , but only part of the house have be update .<ssssss>when we encounter a problem -lrb- i.e. no hot water for a whole morning -rrb- reception staff be very unhelpful , range from unfriendly to sarcastic .<ssssss>there be no apology and i just think that a big international hotel like this should have personnel who be charming and nice when such thing happen .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 3 3 1 1		bad experience after read review decide to stay here on my birthday to have a relaxing fun time .<ssssss>bad choice .<ssssss>i think the room we stay in be # 6 .<ssssss>sewer gas in bathroom be so bad that it also enter the bedroom area .<ssssss>we complain to both owner and they blame the smell on the family who have stay there the previous night with a small child .<ssssss>i know the smell of sewer gas and its cause by bad plumbing not from previous night guest .<ssssss>owner do not express any desire to help we other than open a window which allow a lot of street noise into the room .<ssssss>we be unable to sleep and feel very disappointed and cheated .<ssssss>now we know why she want to be pay in advance and not accept a credit card to reserve the room .<ssssss>we would not recommend this place to anyone , as it be one of the worst experience we have ever have in we travel .<ssssss>we would have be better off if we have sleep in the train station .<ssssss>
3 4 4 5 4 3 3 1		ok stay in time square the westin ny time square be pretty nice , but nothing to write home about .<ssssss>we get we room on a special rate under $ 200 per night , which be great for this area .<ssssss>at that rate , the hotel be well worth it , but i would never pay the normal $ 300 - $ 400 .<ssssss>on this trip we also stay at the westin grand in dc and the westin in philadelphia .<ssssss>this hotel in time square be definitely inferior to the other two .<ssssss>the staff here be not very friendly .<ssssss>the tub in the bathroom be stop up and the cordless phone next to the bed do not work .<ssssss>housekeeping do not clean we room the first day , either .<ssssss>the hotel 's location be great for show and time square attraction , and the heavenly bed be always extremely comfortable .<ssssss>

4 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		good business class hotel stay one night in september 2005 .<ssssss>pleasant room , very comfortable .<ssssss>this be a very good business class hotel .<ssssss>modern , not quaint .<ssssss>the art deco blandishments be not in the best of taste -lrb- particularly in the hallway -rrb- and unnecessary .<ssssss>not a sterile hotel though .<ssssss>staff helpful and very pleasant .<ssssss>
5 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		we love we stay !<ssssss>we do not understand some of the bad review of this hotel .<ssssss>now that we be home , we best memory be of the walk to waikiki - morning -lrb- get you coffee at the honolulu coffee company ! -rrb-<ssssss>for coffee and sunset walk for dinner .<ssssss>so perfect .<ssssss>i almost do not want to enter a good review to keep the hotel a secret!they be small , but how much time do you spend in you room anyway?everyone at the hotel be friendly and helpful.don ' t forget to visit the east and north shore ... good day trip .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 5 -1 5 -1		good value for the area i choose the elan hotel modern base on glowing tripadvisor rating , its proximity to the lo angele county museum of art , and its value-pricing for its location .<ssssss>i end up have mix feeling about my experience there .<ssssss>the good point be that service be excellent .<ssssss>staff go out of its way to provide you every need .<ssssss>i appreciate the business center with its computer and printer that allow I to check my office e-mail without charge and without drag my laptop through airport security .<ssssss>the hotel have a nice exercise center , too .<ssssss>the location be close to the shopping of beverly center and farmer 's market , and museum row , among other .<ssssss>the hotel provide breakfast -lrb- bread and cereal , fresh fruit , hard boil egg -rrb- and a cheese/wine reception on weekday evening .<ssssss>the room have down comforter , which would be nice on chilly night .<ssssss>they be not stingy with they plush pillow , plus there be extra pillow and blanket in the wardrobe .<ssssss>what orbitz do not tell I about be the mandatory valet parking at $ 14.50 per day plus the obligatory tip .<ssssss>add this cost to the room price when you do you comparison shopping .<ssssss>there be no on-street parking available in this area , and no off-street parking except the valet basement garage.the room be small , the window could not be leave open due to street/airport noise , and i could distinctly hear the snore -lrb- and conversation -rrb- of my next-door neighbor .<ssssss>i feel fortunate that i do not get treat to any other nocturnal sound from the room next door .<ssssss>in this caliber of hotel , i expect better sound-proofing .<ssssss>the room have a refrigerator , which be always welcome .<ssssss>unfortunately , it be not plug in when we arrive .<ssssss>i have to pull it out of its cabinet to discover that the electrical outlet be expect to service the tv , the fridge , and the desk lamp .<ssssss>no other outlet be nearby , so you have to choose which one you be willing to live without .<ssssss>if you need to stay in this area , the elan hotel modern be still a better price than nearby hotel such as the sofitel -- but if you travel plan allow you the option of choose a less-pricey area , there may be other hotel you like better for the money .<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 4 4 2 -1		odd location , nice bed i just return from two decent night at this hilton .<ssssss>the hotel be a big disappointment at first .<ssssss>when i walk in , the lobby be barely cooler than outside -lrb- 110 degree . -rrb-<ssssss>check in be quick , and they give I a cold bottle of water , but the staff could not answer my simple question -lrb- where can we get a quick dinner around here ? -rrb-<ssssss>the decor throughout the hotel be old and tired , and the faint odor do not help .<ssssss>the elevator be completely stuffy , so i choose the stair after just two try on the elevator .<ssssss>the room be just like the hallway - old and slightly smelly , but at least the temperature be lower .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny , but compare to the rest of the hotel , it be beautiful .<ssssss>everything in the room look clean , but i do not dare sit on the couch or the desk chair .<ssssss>the lamp switch be all slightly sticky , and i do my best to ignore that .<ssssss>as with all hilton hotel nowadays , there be card with instruction about how to get the sheet and towel change .<ssssss>since i be only there for two night , i end up put the do-not-disturb sign out the entire time -lrb- no need for housekeeping to come in if they be not go to change my sheet or towel . -rrb-<ssssss>two thing make the entire stay a 3 star instead of a 2 star .<ssssss>first , the sheet be completely clean , and the bed be very comfortable .<ssssss>second , the bathroom be clean , and the water pressure be great.in term of location , this hilton be apparently in a weird place .<ssssss>two different long-time phoenix resident have trouble find the place because it be -lrb- a -rrb- not near most other airport hotel , -lrb- b -rrb- off a little-known highway that be only two mile long , and -lrb- c -rrb- near some bad part of town .<ssssss>there be no restaurant or shop nearby , and drive back to the airport be also a bit of a challenge .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 4 1 1 -1		the unfriendliess hotel i have ever have the misfortune of stay at .<ssssss>i stay at this hotel with two friend in may 2008 , and the problem start immediately on arrival .<ssssss>we first impression of the hotel itself be good , it be modern and be in a great location .<ssssss>however , when we check in , we be give a room with a king size bed even though we have book a room with 2 double as there be 3 of we .<ssssss>the staff seem totally bemused as to why this would be a problem .<ssssss>when we ask if we could change to a double room , we be tell that there be none available as the hotel be full and that they would send up a fold away bed .<ssssss>we be all too tired to argue any further -lrb- it be 11.30 pm -rrb- and go off to we room.two and a half hour later and after many phone call to the reception desk , we foldaway bed arrive without any bedding .<ssssss>it take another 45 minute for that to arrive , and we be present with a dirty quilt with no cover .<ssssss>we ask for a cover every day , but it never arrive .<ssssss>the maid -lrb- the only pleasant staff member we come into contact with -rrb- also tell we that the hotel be not even half full , so why they choose not to give we another room be a mystery.the room itself be clean and tidy , with a great view over time square .<ssssss>we stay on the 14th floor , and be amaze with the lack of outside noise we hear .<ssssss>the rudeness from the hotel staff continue throughout we stay , from the disinterested reception desk staff who refuse to give any eye contact to the bar staff who huff and tut when we point out they have give we the wrong drink order .<ssssss>this really ruin we stay , and make we feel totally uncomfortable.on the plus side , the cocktail at the bar be amazing , even though you have to face the wrath of the bar staff to get they .<ssssss>the room be well equip , although the voltage be low -lrb- most we hotel be like this -rrb- and we struggle with hairdryer , hair straightener etc. my tip would be to use the hairdryer provide rather than try to take one from the uk .<ssssss>the wardrobe be huge , with plenty of hang space and hanger , and the bathroom be spacious and modern with towel replace daily .<ssssss>the room be clean thoroughly every day , and the bathroom sparkle afterwards.unfortunately , due to the attitude of hotel staff , i would hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone , which be a shame because it offer great value for money in a wonderful city .<ssssss>i will definately go back to new york , but i will take my custom somewhere else .<ssssss>
4 5 3 4 5 5 4 3		nice hotel , good enough for the money we stay in amrey during december visit to barcelona .<ssssss>i agree with most other reviewer - this be a very basic hotel but it be good value for the money .<ssssss>the room be very simple with almost no amenity .<ssssss>the staff be very attentive .<ssssss>the hotel be located in a quite , safe residential neighborhood right next to a very big -lrb- and beautiful -rrb- hospital .<ssssss>it be 10 minute walk to sangrada de familia , biggest cathedral in barcelona .<ssssss>this location be also a stop for most tour bus , so you can begin a city tour here if you would like to .<ssssss>there be 2 train station 5 minute walk from the hotel .<ssssss>i recommend use different station depend if you be go to or from the hotel to avoid walk up-hill .<ssssss>train arrive every 5 minute , and it be easy to get to most popular place in barcelona with 15 minute .<ssssss>there be free wireless internet available , but only in the lobby.what we like - location , valuewhat we do not like - wireless internet be not available in the room , only in the lobbytrain station - go to hotel : l4 , guinardotrain station - go from hotel : l5 , camp de l'arpagoogle map :[ -- -rsb-<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 3 2 2 -1		not what we expect this be we 2nd visit to amsterdam , the 1st be a wonderful experience so the standard set be high .<ssssss>although the hotel itself be clean and the room spacious we find the staff uninterested and unfriendly .<ssssss>not a lot of smile face here , and when we go up to we room after breakfast on the 3rd day we find we key card do not work .<ssssss>at reception we be tell we be down for check out - we have another 4 day leave !<ssssss>- but even so 10am be not the check out time .<ssssss>staff seem to tolerate we but not welcome we , so we will not be recommend this hotel or stay with this group again .<ssssss>last year we be at the crown plaza - go there !<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 5 4 5 2		great little budget hotel the location of this hotel be wonderful as it be close to public transportation and also give you exceptional access to the day-to-day life of hong kong 's average citizens.however , to appreciate this hotel you must first understand that what it offer in term of comfort be very basic : * yes , my room be small , but it be very tidy and the bed be very clean .<ssssss>-lrb- the mattress , however , appear to have be fabricate from the same material use on armoured tank to protect they from rocket attack . -rrb-<ssssss>the bathroom be immaculate and the water pressure in the shower be good .<ssssss>* the staff at the front desk be extremely polite and helpful , although they english skill might not always be the best .<ssssss>* it be difficult for I to understand some of the other review of this hotel because during my stay a doorman be always on duty and a staff member be always on hand to help with luggage.if you expectation be reasonable , and if you want to experience the vibrant , chaotic street life of middle - and working-class kowloon , this hotel be a fine choice .<ssssss>there be several typical cafe nearby where it be very enjoyable to sit and sip a iced milk tea while you people-watch .<ssssss>
1 1 5 -1 5 -1 1 -1		worst service ever !!!<ssssss>i have never experience anything like this .<ssssss>only one restaurant be open .<ssssss>there be two waiter for the entire restaurant .<ssssss>people be bus they own table and get they own drink from behind the bar .<ssssss>check-in be a nightmare and take close to two hour .<ssssss>you could not make dinner reservation at the 2 restaurant open for dinner unless you pay for royal service .<ssssss>the management suck .<ssssss>do not go here !<ssssss>you will have better food and service at a howard johnson or holiday inn .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 2 3 1 -1		i have stay in better 3 star hotel upon be upgrade to a apartment , we be horrify to be step into a smoky non-smoking room .<ssssss>the decor be far from impressive , especially the cheap and tacky bit of chipboard pass for a bathroom cabinet.the robotic hotel reception staff seem quite unplussed at my dissatisifaction , when i raise the above.the breakfast experience , at the garden buffet , be more like attend a food court than a 5 star dining room .<ssssss>upon arrival the queue to get a table be more like attend the local club -lrb- rsl , poky venue -rrb- .<ssssss>while the choice of food be impressive and well display -lrb- and tasty -rrb- , the sight of bus-boy trolley clear table remind I of the food court at the local westfield shopping centre .<ssssss>plus queue for the egg station to have a omelete make would have be a novel experience if i could have be bothered.in future , we will be return to the wentworth , be the experience be truly 5-star .<ssssss>
1 2 2 -1 4 -1 1 -1		if you do not want to have a good time ... .<ssssss>i give this hotel 1 star because it be clean , that be about all that it have go for it .<ssssss>i find the staff to be unhelpful and rude .<ssssss>
3 3 1 3 5 3 3 -1		cute - but ... .<ssssss>after read review through trip advisor we book a three night pre-cruise stay at the coral princess inn .<ssssss>the hotel be very cute and very , very clean with lot of nice area around the hotel for sit and relax .<ssssss>the breakfast area be very nice .<ssssss>i will say though that we have the smallest hotel room -lrb- # 8 -rrb- we have ever stay in .<ssssss>there be a double bed with barely enough room to walk around it - in fact , we both bang we shin on the corner of the bed several time .<ssssss>there be no closet , only a small armoire with 2 hanger .<ssssss>we do not unpack we suitcase - there be no room .<ssssss>we think we better get use to it as we be go to a inside cabin on the ship - but believe I , that be way bigger !<ssssss>on the last day , we be able to store we bag in a lock room for the afternoon with a bunch of other luggage -lrb- very convenient -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all , it be a cute hotel ... fine to stay in for a night or two , but i sure would not plan a week holiday there - at least not in that room .<ssssss>the $ 120 we night charge , with tax , end up cost $ 181.71 per night cdn .<ssssss>- reasonable i guess for puerto rico , but ...<ssssss>
5 5 4 4 5 2 5 5		amazing clss trip stay .<ssssss>view from room balcony<ssssss>
3 2 2 1 3 3 1 -1		just for kid my 2 girlfriend and i go to dr to seek a place for my wedding .<ssssss>it will not be in punta cana !<ssssss>the room be nice but very small .<ssssss>they have no towel for we at the pool and tell we to come back in one hour .<ssssss>we have lunch at the world cafe then go back and they have plenty of towel .<ssssss>the pool be by far the best part of the trip .<ssssss>except very poor service by the pool .<ssssss>generally i be a beach person but it have a horrible odor .<ssssss>the pool be amazing .<ssssss>it wrap around the entire resort .<ssssss>the food be less than average at all of the restaurant .<ssssss>the drink be gross .<ssssss>exactly what you expect at a all-inclusive .<ssssss>room service be not good .<ssssss>a very limited menu .<ssssss>no alcohol permit unless you want to pay $ $ $ .<ssssss>ton of kid .<ssssss>no singles , if that be what you be look for .<ssssss>night club be cheesy .<ssssss>the photographer on site be terrific .<ssssss>a great place to take family photo , engagement pic or pic of the kid .<ssssss>the have daily animal walk thru the resort to take picture with -lrb- monkey , snake , parrot -rrb- .<ssssss>expect to pay $ 10 - $ 15 per photo .<ssssss>be aware of the sun ... very strong .<ssssss>i have travel a lot but this be the strongest i have ever be around .<ssssss>overall , just okay .<ssssss>nothing spectacular !<ssssss>would never go back .<ssssss>
4 2 5 5 5 5 5 3		beautiful resort but !!<ssssss>we stay at the majestic colonial the week of december 10 , 2007 with a party of 3 adult and one child .<ssssss>the resort be beautiful and the garden be extremely well maintain .<ssssss>i have never see so many staff work at a resort .<ssssss>the pool be fantastic and stretch the whole length of the resort .<ssssss>we have storm that pass south of island through midweek which cause major power outage , however , the main lobby and restaurant still function .<ssssss>we do not try the japanese but the food in all all the other a la carte restaurant as well as the buffet be excellent .<ssssss>i tip occasionally at the bar , but there be no real reason to .<ssssss>i actually have a $ 5 tip give back to I at the main lobby bar , the reason be it be unnecessary .<ssssss>my only complaint be that except for one adult , we all get sick by mid-week , which last about 24 hour .<ssssss>we be warn not to drink the water in the room but be assure that everywhere else use purify water ; ice cube , salad 's etc. however , the problem i observe be extremely poor food handling and food preparation technique .<ssssss>every day i observe several staff prepare food with no protection on there hand .<ssssss>also , cold food like meat , cheese , etc , would sit out in the buffet restaurant , unrefrigerated .<ssssss>even several freshly prepared cook item be leave to go cold after a few minute instead of keep they hot.other than the food problem we encounter , i would still recommend the resort to anyone .<ssssss>just be picky what you eat , and do not prepare yourself a cold meat sandwich .<ssssss>this be a common item we all have mid-afternoon one day and may have be the culprit .<ssssss>
1 2 4 -1 5 -1 1 -1		just be warn we just return from a trip to the ocean blue with another couple .<ssssss>she be pregnant , so we most certainly be not look for a party atmosphere and all of we have live in europe at one point or another , so i would consider we extrememly well travel .<ssssss>that be say , here go the review : yes , the resort be gorgeous .<ssssss>i have be to punta cana before and the ocean blue definitley put the other resort to shame in term of the layout , the room , and the pool area .<ssssss>therefore , it be a even greater shame that they employee just do not seem to care about the resort , or it be visitors.our friend have no hot water the entire time we be there .<ssssss>yes they send maintenance up -lrb- every day since they be never actually able to fix it -rrb- , but who want to spend they entire vacation wait for maintenance ?<ssssss>thank god we be in a room next door to theirs so that they could use we shower .<ssssss>the most upset part about this be that there be never a apology , never a offer to transfer they to another room , nothing .<ssssss>just sit and wait for maintenance worker every day .<ssssss>on the final day , the pin in the back of they toilet pop out and the bathroom flood .<ssssss>when they call customer relation , they be tell to wait until nine when maintenance would be in .<ssssss>the only reason someone come up to stop the water from gush be when the maid see what be happen and place a frantic phone call .<ssssss>lovely.my key cease work twice during we four day there .<ssssss>the first time luckily i i run into a worker who let I into my room .<ssssss>the other time i call from we friend 's room , then wait for a hour and a half for someone to come .<ssssss>when they do not , i call for a third time and be promptly yell at by the man at the front desk .<ssssss>i need to clarify here that i be not at all a yeller , so i promise you i be not be rude or antagonize he in any way .<ssssss>finally , someone show up , but with another key that do not work !<ssssss>so i be put in the back of a golf cart and take up to the front desk -lrb- now over two hour from when i have initially want to retire for the evening -rrb- .<ssssss>when i get the front desk , the man who have yell at I basically toss the key at I , and completely blow I off when i ask he why he have be so mean .<ssssss>he quite obviously do not care that i be on the brink of tear .<ssssss>very nice.our husband have want to go to this resort because it be bill as a beach golf resort .<ssssss>please do not go here if you be plan on golfing .<ssssss>it be actually funny how little anyone know about the golf course that be on they property !<ssssss>every concierge we ask have a different answer as to how much it cost -lrb- mind you we be actually stay in something call the golf junior suite -rrb- - when the tee time be , where to catch the shuttle -lrb- or if there even be a shuttle -rrb- , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>basically , no one at this resort know anything about the resort and would rather you leave frustrated and angry rather than they have to actually do something to find out the answer for you .<ssssss>i have never get so many blank stare or i do not know , or irritated look when they have to remove they cell phone from they ear to help out.these be just some of the example of what happen during we trip .<ssssss>i hate to be such a complainer , but i just really do not want anyone to waste they money when you could go to much nicer , more pleasant place like turk caico , bermuda or even the bahama .<ssssss>we friend will most likely be write they own review as well , so you will see that we be not make this up.one last note , when we be leave through we elite club private checkout and tell they of all of the issue we have , again we be promptly blow off and then inform that we owe $ 30 for a bottle of wine .<ssssss>talk about want to scream in frustration !<ssssss>
5 5 5 3 5 4 4 2		wow , what a great experience we stay for one night and use hilton point .<ssssss>we have the best service - free breakfast , late checkout , friendly staff .<ssssss>the lobby be beautiful .<ssssss>we room be on the fifth floor .<ssssss>love the bathroom and the robe .<ssssss>my only complaint be that the tub be too long for I .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be amazing .<ssssss>i would definitely recommend stay there .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 4 1 4 3		average first off let I say that the location be very good - almost right next to the duomo and the room size be fairly good ... .<ssssss>they be the positives.negatives -lrb- you may want to get some popcorn -rrb- the view we have from room 507 / 508 -lrb- can not exactly remember which number now -rrb- be that of a wall , and not of a particulary exciting wall at that either .<ssssss>i think it be yellow .<ssssss>the view from the roof terrace be not that much better , unless you happen to break the 8 foot barrier height wise which niether myself or my 5 foot girlfriend do or have in you possesion a step ladder , which she forget to pack.the staff ... .<ssssss>mmm , very average at best .<ssssss>not very chatty , a bit weird look maybe , do not ask we about we stay or any of that malarky .<ssssss>we even get tell off for drinking champagne on the roof terrace when no other person be around .<ssssss>the reason .<ssssss>health and safety !!!<ssssss>... .<ssssss>this be italy , they do not do health and safety , there be probably not even a word for it in italian !!!<ssssss>- they just want we to buy they own champagne I think , but i be just guess .<ssssss>word of advice overall , do not pay for anything by credit card in florence -lrb- or in italy in general -rrb- if you can help it .<ssssss>i only use my card twice .<ssssss>once at the cash point almost next to the hotel -lrb- near the knickers and bra shop -rrb- and at a crappy rather expensive restuarant in the middle of the one of the square -lrb- can not remember which one -rrb- and between they , i manage to get my card clone .<ssssss>i cry like a little girl , it be not a pretty sight.if you have a choice of hotel , then find somewhere else .<ssssss>if how ever you be like I and it be a present from you girlfriend / misstress what ever , then just smile , pretend you like it and pat she on the head for make such a excellent and informed choice.rant over .<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 3 -1 5 -1		pretty good ... probably would not go back my friend and i stay at the breeze resort 05/15-05 / 22 , and we have a ok time .<ssssss>i do not recommend this resort for singles , unless travel with a big group .<ssssss>as two single college girl , we find it somewhat bore be surround by couple and family with small child .<ssssss>and the disco be terrible .<ssssss>i be not too keen on the idea of eat any meat there , so that definitly limited my food option .<ssssss>get reservation for a retaaurant be a pain , so we mainly stick with the buffet .<ssssss>overall , the buffet be pretty boring , with the same thing everyday .<ssssss>i eat very little , so the fact that it be all-inclusive do not mean much .<ssssss>i find the staff to be incredibly nice .<ssssss>all of the bartender be extremely upbeat .<ssssss>all the woman seem to take a liking to ramon , a bartender at the swim-up bar who be very handsome .<ssssss>judge from other people review , we definitly luck out with we room .<ssssss>room 4407 have a amazing few of the pool and ocean .<ssssss>it have a slight musty smell due to the humidity but we didn ; t mind .<ssssss>we maid be very friendly and accomodate .<ssssss>the bed be hard , but most hotel be anyways .<ssssss>i do not experience any stomach issue while on vacation , however since i have return my stomach have be bother I .<ssssss>i have not go to the doctor to see the cause , however , so i can not necessarily blame it on the hotel .<ssssss>i advise learn some key spanish word , because the staff tend to know little english .<ssssss>as long as you know the basics , you will be able to communicate with the staff enough to get what you want .<ssssss>however , if you plan on hold a conversation , you will need to know more .<ssssss>i have never be to the dominican republic before , nor have i be to a all-inclusive resort so i do not have much to compare it too , but i would say overall the hotel be ok .<ssssss>not much for single college student to do , but it be very relaxing .<ssssss>i do not think i would stay there again .<ssssss>well ... maybe for ramon .<ssssss>= -rrb-<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 4 4 4 1		second time around this be the second time we stay at the paris hotel , the first time be five year ago.after a second look we would say we like the location which be 5 minute from the station and 5 minute from the domo , the central market and the main square .<ssssss>there be no restaurant or bar at the paris as there be many better alternative in the street around .<ssssss>you get a big breakfast , large clean room and excellent service .<ssssss>the building be a old palazzo -lrb- merchant house -rrb- which have load of character.it do have a downside though .<ssssss>even with double glazing and air-con , florence be all around you from the twice daily ringing of the church bell , to the over enthusiastic carabinierus roar through the street at full throttle , to the nightly bin collection outside .<ssssss>luckily we be so tired from we full day in florence we barely noticed.so if you want to be insulate from the real florence outside try one of the business class hotel elsewhere but the paris will always be one of we favourite hotel .<ssssss>
4 3 5 4 5 3 4 2		great location - more business then pleasure .<ssssss>a view of san francisco<ssssss>

4 5 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		such a great surprise !!!<ssssss>we be worry about stay at the crest after some crappy review - nevertheless , we decide to book b/c the price and location be great .<ssssss>we be so glad we do !!<ssssss>for 2 double bed we only spend 175 $ a night , and the location be perfect .<ssssss>the staff be a tad clueless but really nice in any case .<ssssss>the room be great !<ssssss>the bed be small -lrb- a sobe staple i think -rrb- but we have a full kitchen , cable , and clean linen every night .<ssssss>one gripe : the overhead lamp do not work , so we ignore it , haha .<ssssss>whoever complain about the pool need to get a life - there be a handful of small leaf on the bottom , not a big deal .<ssssss>we be really glad we stay there , and would recommend to friend .<ssssss>
3 4 2 -1 5 -1 5 -1		great staff hotel be good but not a 5 star .<ssssss>great staff , very friendly and helpful ... i fall in love with everyone , but accomadation suck !!!!!<ssssss>i truly believe they could do some major update in they room , it just do not qualify for a 5 star .<ssssss>i will give it a 4 but i guess the staff specially at the restaurant buffet and the outside bar make up for it .<ssssss>would i go back ??<ssssss>... maybe , if on sale !!!!!<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 4 5 4 3		not worth the cheap price ok , first i have to start by say that in general , i find this hotel to be pleasant .<ssssss>the staff be courteous and helpful .<ssssss>in general , i find boston ridiculously overprice for hotel room and be look for a deal , but i certainly do not expect to have to share my room with mouse , my basic complaint .<ssssss>if not for the live vermin , scurry around the room at night , i would have thoroughly enjoy my stay , particularly give the location and price , however i be unable to sleep peacefully with mouse scurry around the room .<ssssss>conveniently located , the shawmut inn have a number of perk that include the fact that it be easily serviceable by public transportation , and serve a nice continental breakfast , that definitely help get the day start right if you be sightseeing shopping etc. the neighborhood be fine .<ssssss>if you have ever live in any urban area there be neighborhood like this .<ssssss>yes it be noisy , this be not a nice quiet hotel but once again the urban noise be expect give the area and its proximity to sport venue , bar , and club .<ssssss>when i complain about the mouse i be give another room .<ssssss>initially i be impress with the quick change of room and the accommodate nature of the staff ... little do i realize that mouse be just a problem in the hotel period .<ssssss>i be write this from my hotel room at nearly 4 in the morning because i literally can not sleep , and i have see one mouse scurry across my room twice -lrb- or maybe its two different mouse -rrb- as i be write this .<ssssss>overall , i honestly can not say that the cheap price be worth share you room with uninvited guest .<ssssss>but if the occasional mouse in you room do not bother you , then this be actually a great deal for the money .<ssssss>
3 5 2 4 5 5 5 5		clean , friendly but old we stay for 2 night .<ssssss>the room have 2 dbl bed .<ssssss>it be very clean very safe but also very old .<ssssss>i be not fussy or fancy but the old funiture and carpet take I off guard .<ssssss>other eview say the front desk be not friendly ... i find they to be charming and helpful.the location be very nice but we have a limited time to see a great deal and it would have be better to stay near the wharf to see the tourist stuff and ride the trolly .<ssssss>the city bus be right around the corner from the hotel so if you have more time to spend this be great.if you be not botherd by od furniture this place be perfect ... price and parking cant be beat ... and again it be old but clean .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 1 4 4 4		great location , but ick !<ssssss>i be work for 4 week in downtown dalla and i choose the radisson for the location - a easy walk to the mockbird light rail station which drop I off right outside the building where i be work .<ssssss>plus there be shop , restaurant , and a movie theater with several independent film .<ssssss>also around the mockbird station , there be a jason 's deli and a kroger grocery.so beyond that , well .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the parking be free and every other place i stay charge $ 20/night , and i get this place for $ 111/night , which be the cheapest .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable and the room have update furniture .<ssssss>the staff be friendly .<ssssss>the wireless be free.beyond that , the problem be someone do the worst job i have ever see at remodel this hotel .<ssssss>its like they idea to make it look nice be to throw cheap paint on a dirty wall and call it do .<ssssss>the wallpaper be peel off the wall and every corner you look in be rusty , dirty , fall apart .<ssssss>the power outlet be all filthy , the paint have be patch in place with different color , the tub faucet be fall apart and rust out , the shower head be mount out nearly 2 inch from the chip tile that be be paint over and be now peel .<ssssss>they drip and smudge paint all over the wallpaper , tile , and countertop and do not bother to clean it up .<ssssss>it make the whole room seem dirty .<ssssss>its gross .<ssssss>this be the only hotel i have stay at this month without a refrigerator -lrb- or minibar frig . -rrb-<ssssss>it look like they add on the lobby section of the hotel and do not bother to do a full structural remodel - there be board up room downstairs .<ssssss>my room on the 4th floor only have a window from halfway up and a lovely view of the roof of the lobby.i decide not to come back due to the condition of the room , regardless of the price and convenience .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 4 3 2 2		good , but didnt knock my sock off we stay here on honeymoon in jan 07 for 6 night .<ssssss>its a nice hotel , in a nice setting , but really have get to agree with the comment that this be a hotel which will take you money for any reason imaginable .<ssssss>in balus generally , tourist be cash-cows , the more the beat you , the more you pay !<ssssss>we be charge for 30 min internet access -lrb- regardless of whether we use 5 min or 30 min -rrb- .<ssssss>the service be very slow , especially then we change traveller cheque , but the staff be very friendly and always great you with a smile and ask how you be - yes , you would expect that from any hotel , but the balianese smile be very warm.this be a 5 star hotel with 5 star price , so if you eat or drink in the hotel expect to pay ... a lot !!!!!<ssssss>but right outside the hotel door be the bali collection -lrb- a collection of 8-10 resteraunt and 10-12 shop and a supermarket -rrb- which be far more reasonably price .<ssssss>if you be expect balus to be cheap , think again .<ssssss>if you eat in nusa dua , expect to pay more for food and drink .<ssssss>yes it be cheaper then uk price , but when you be there -lrb- and you dont convert price back to you own currency -rrb- it feel like you be pay over the odds , and you be !<ssssss>its a resort full of 5 star hotel and they know it .<ssssss>therefore everything in nusa dua cost more than anywhere else in balus .<ssssss>my strongest recommendation be to venture out of nusa dua as much as possible .<ssssss>jimboran bay be very nice for food -lrb- mainly seafood though -rrb- and you can eat on the beach with the ocean crawl up the sand just meter from you table.its a nice hotel with a nice beach , nice pool and nice setting .<ssssss>but be you want something more than nice , choose somewhere else !<ssssss>

4 3 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		wonderful beach resort - not for snorkele first thing first , if you plan on stay at the new riu palace be sure you flight be into punta cana .<ssssss>ours be but then in typical american airline fashion be cancel , and we be divert into san domingo .<ssssss>take it from someone who make the trip , all 3 hour of it at 12:30 be you do not want to .<ssssss>if you have to travel during the day the trip could easily take 4 hour or more depend on traffic .<ssssss>there be no traffic during we ride .<ssssss>there be highway for about the first 70km or so and then you get onto blacktop 2 lane road with plenty of pothole , speed bump and dip , and obstacle galore .<ssssss>we driver manage to run over not 1 , but 2 dog during we sojourn .<ssssss>thankfully he do not add any human to that tally , but i think that be pure luck .<ssssss>enough say about that , remember land in punta cana .<ssssss>first of all let I say that the facility itself be gorgeous !<ssssss>that be say there be some room for improvement in the managing of the facility and the offer amenity .<ssssss>i will start by give you the con and then the positive .<ssssss>riu bill this as a five -lrb- 5 -rrb- star resort , which the structure itself be .<ssssss>however , we book we 8 day stay directly with riu reservation , almost 3 month prior to the facility opening .<ssssss>when we make the reservation we ask for a ocean view , with a king size bed .<ssssss>upon arrive in san juan , earlier on the day of we arrival we contact the hotel manager on duty to let they know we would be delay arrive there and to reconfirm we room requirement .<ssssss>no problem .<ssssss>when we finally arrive at the hotel at 3:30 am there be no bellman etc. -lrb- remember now this be suppose to be a five star facility -rrb- we have to bring in we own luggage from the cab and find a couple of people at the main desk .<ssssss>we introduce ourselves and check in .<ssssss>because we make we own reservation , -lrb- and to be honest i be not sure about they policy if you book through a tour agency -rrb- we have to prepay for we entire stay when we check in .<ssssss>they say it be company policy as they have be stiff by people in the past , they have stay and upon check out they card be deny etc. so be forewarn you will be require to prepay for you entire stay when you check in .<ssssss>after check in they do track down someone to see we to we room along with we luggage .<ssssss>when we arrive at the room they assign we to it be a side garden view with two double bed shove together , not the ocean view with the king size bed .<ssssss>we relay we displeasure to the bellman who contact the front desk .<ssssss>when he finish the conversation we be tell that the room we be suppose to be in be not clean and they be sorry and would move we to a room like we have request in the morning .<ssssss>-lrb- now realize they have a additional 8 hour prior to we arrival to make the room ready after we have contact they in san juan -rrb- .<ssssss>the night manager promise we a particular room , so we go and check it out from the outside -lrb- it have a do not disturb sign hanging on the door -rrb- we say that the room would be acceptable and turn in for the night in the room originally assign to we .<ssssss>-lrb- note -rrb- the ac in this room work great !<ssssss>.<ssssss>lastly we ask the bellman about room service , since we have not eat in at least 14 hour and be inform that the hotel have no room service whatsoever .<ssssss>if we be hungry though they do provide ready to eat snack in the sport bar which be open 24 hour a day .<ssssss>we just go to bed .<ssssss>-lrb- we do find out later however that you could get you choice of 3 different style of breakfast deliver to you room , although we never try it -rrb- .<ssssss>the next day we awake , go down have breakfast , check out we surroundings a bit and then go to the front desk to arrange we move to the promise room .<ssssss>the day manager say that the promise move would not be possible as the room the night manager have promise we be a more expensive room .<ssssss>but he would move we to a room at the other end of the same hall face the ocean .<ssssss>the room be exactly the same , so what give ?<ssssss>the one he offer be on one corner of the building , and the promise room be on the other corner .<ssssss>any way we take the room after a inspection to make sure that the new room do indeed meet we criterion .<ssssss>we also end up move we own luggage to this new room after wait almost 45 minute for the promise bellman who never show up .<ssssss>the new room be beautiful , and be everything that we expect .<ssssss>the ocean view be still questionable though , you have to look over the roof of the health club/spa to see it , in fact if you look at the facility , the design be somewhat poor in that the lower level of room on the end of both wing of the hotel , the one that should be all ocean view , be both obstruct by support building .<ssssss>one be the spa , and on the other side , one of the restaurant obstruct the view .<ssssss>with so few room on the end of the building you would have think they would have protect the premium view from these suite , but do not .<ssssss>any way , back to we room , additionally the air conditioner be not keep the room cool .<ssssss>we go down to the front desk , and speak with the manager directly about the ac and he assure we he would send someone right up to fix it .<ssssss>so we return to we room to finally unpack and settle in for the week .<ssssss>after and hour the mechanic have still not show up to address the problem and another call be make .<ssssss>eventually a couple of maintenance people show up with a hose and a ladder , and mess around for about 30 minute with the unit in the ceiling and then leave .<ssssss>at any rate they have make no difference in the operation of the unit which just barely manage to keep the room at about 80 - 85 degree .<ssssss>this ordeal eat up we entire morning of we second day there .<ssssss>we do not get out of the room until after 1:00 pm with have to deal with all of this .<ssssss>up until the time we leave the air conditioning issue be never resolve .<ssssss>it be a daily call after hot sticky night , with promise of repair make by the manager , only to return that evening to the same condition .<ssssss>we main desire on vacation be to find resort that provide both the 5 star amenity that we want with great snorkeling .<ssssss>we be both diver and take we own gear but prefer to snorkel off the beach and take the occasional tour .<ssssss>we both be very confident in we ability of 20 + year each and will sometimes snorkel from the beach 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile out depend on the condition .<ssssss>the punta cana palace while provide a somewhat five star facility do not have the snorkeling that we and most likely other will desire .<ssssss>the swim area which we usually venture out of very quickly , be relatively small and we be drive back in by people in watercraft each time we venture outside this area .<ssssss>the boat traffic be just terrible between shuttle diver from place to place , people ride the banana tube , and parasailing there be a constant tumult of boat traffic .<ssssss>one of the diver at the dive shop -lrb- book dive tour -rrb- say that if we really want good snorkeling we would need to sign up for one of the day long tour , which in the end consist of about 3 to 4 hour of good snorkeling and 6 to 7 hour of transportation on a bus boat etc. we try it and find that the small amount of snorkele time be not worth the majority of the day be spend on travel which start at 6:30 am and end at 7:00 pm .<ssssss>the punta cana palace in addition to a beautiful facility , also have some really good dining .<ssssss>the 5 specialty restaurant in particular be first class both in food and service .<ssssss>the buffet also offer a abundance and variety of great food .<ssssss>the specialty restaurant be include in the all inclusive but you have to make reservation each morning at 10:00 be for the restaurant of you choice .<ssssss>so if you be not there early you will miss out .<ssssss>there be two seating each night one at 6:30 pm the other at 9:00 pm .<ssssss>seating be limit to about 30 table or less per restaurant or so it look .<ssssss>we end up cut we stay there short by 4 day due to the air conditioning issue , but mostly due to the snorkeling availability .<ssssss>we end up at the sunscape casa del mar in la romana .<ssssss>i will write a review of we stay there as well .<ssssss>get the 4 day refund be a hassle too , if you will recall we have to prepay for the entire stay upon arrival .<ssssss>all in all the facility be beautiful and the food be great .<ssssss>as for the five star rating , if you can live with the placate mediocre management , limited service time for some of the staff -lrb- such as bellman -rrb- , lack of room service , and a concierge that will not or can not arrange airport pick up or delivery among other thing , then you will thoroughly enjoy this facility .<ssssss>lastly -lrb- and i know this be really be picky -rrb- but for a five star facility i use a lot of paper napkin outside of the cloth one at the specialty restaurant .<ssssss>if you want to be a five star facility then be one , five star begin with service and end with the smallest of detail .<ssssss>if you want the five star service that go with the facility then you might want to pass on this one for now , be a new hotel they may eventually get they act together .<ssssss>my rating of above average be base on the building itself , the quality of the food and the friendliness of the support staff other than those behind the front desk , who i will sadly never see again .<ssssss>i can not say enough about the beauty of this facility , but as they say beauty be only skin deep .<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 5 -1 4 -1		wow !<ssssss>this be a beautiful hotel with gorgeous rooms!wonderful hotel that easily beat the mandaran oriental and the four season ... in some respects .<ssssss>i usually stay at the four season but end up at the st. regi at the urge of a co-worker .<ssssss>the room be amazing , contemporary , very roomy , well design , and exceptionally execute .<ssssss>i will be make this my regular stop in san franciscomy only complaint involve small detail and occasionally lax service that i think be only a function of the hotel 's growing pain -lrb- it be only 8 month old -rrb- .<ssssss>i be also baffle by the very small closet , i actually miss it several time because i though it be just storage for the bath robe .<ssssss>it be so small that there be no place to put my suitcase except along the wall in the room.i rate it above average , but with clear potential to become excellent in short order .<ssssss>

2 4 5 2 5 3 3 4		nice hotel , okay location , beware the luggage rack !<ssssss>once you get to the hotel , the interior be quite new and modern .<ssssss>it open in october 2006 .<ssssss>it be about a 10 minute crowd bus ride from the historic part of downtown.it be in a area where there be a lot of construction .<ssssss>currently , the surroundings be not all that great , but that may change depend on what end up be built.the main issue we have be with the in-room luggage rack .<ssssss>i set my daughter luggage on the rack , no problem .<ssssss>the next morning , the cleaning staff remove she luggage to find 2-3 of the leather strap on luggage rack have split at they seem .<ssssss>the luggage be 45-50 pound -lrb- within airline baggage limit -rrb- , nothing unusual .<ssssss>the hotel claim we must of set it down hard or in some way be too rough .<ssssss>my question be why they move she luggage ?<ssssss>normally , mess with a guest luggage be something hotel never do out of fear of complaint about miss item .<ssssss>so my assumption be that they know it be weak and be check it , otherwise , there be no reason for they to be move luggage .<ssssss>the break be not visible unless you lay on the ground and crawl underneath or if you remove the luggage .<ssssss>anyway , the manager get in my face wag he finger at I say we break it and we need to pay for it .<ssssss>when i refuse , he angrily threaten to report I to hilton , which be fine by I .<ssssss>i will be report that manager to hilton as well.anyway , besides the luggage rack and the location , i find the hotel very spacious , clean , and modern , and like the hotel .<ssssss>would stay there again , but keep my luggage on the floor .<ssssss>

4 4 5 3 5 3 -1 -1		nice and cosy just outside the city center we stay at the golden tulip amsterdam art for the easter week-end .<ssssss>although the price be a little high , the hotel by itself be very comfortable .<ssssss>we have a large room in grey and purple , very cosy and comfortable .<ssssss>the bathroom have glass wall -lrb- shy people , be warn -rrb- but be large enough and clean .<ssssss>the view be not pleasant as it be a train warehouse but with little activity and , with the window close , you can sleep comfortably .<ssssss>the only negative point be the mattress : although the bed be very large , the mattress be too soft.for breakfast , you can get the buffet but , for 15â ?<ssssss>per person , it be a little expensive , especially when you consider all the nice place for breakfast you can find in amsterdam.we do not try the restaurant.there seem to be a swimming pool but it be too early in the season to try it.the location of the hotel need attention : if you be look for a place above a canal , go somewhere else .<ssssss>it be a little outside the historic center near a commercial area .<ssssss>the access be nevertheless quite easy with 1 bus stop at the footstep of the hotel -lrb- one bus every 10-45 minute to the central station -rrb- and you can take a 5 minute walk to another bus line the go to the center .<ssssss>there be even a night bus run from midnight to 6am .<ssssss>be careful , there be also a tulip inn at the same address , do not get mix up while booking .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 2 5 3 3		could have be better i really want to like this hotel as it have a cool lobby , nicely appoint room , and a good location , but there be a few spot that they could improve upon .<ssssss>the restaurant be close for renovation , which we do not know until check in .<ssssss>this be a real disappointment and this mean there be also no room service .<ssssss>the hallway i be on have a strong incense-like smell that be not pleasant .<ssssss>it appear no one have clean under we bed in quite awhile : definite dust bunny or something and a empty water bottle .<ssssss>i do like that you receive a free bottle of water upon check-in ; it be a nice touch .<ssssss>two window in the room be already open when we get up to the room so there just seem to be a lack of attention to detail in the housekeeping department .<ssssss>parking price be quite reasonable and the valet service be welcome .<ssssss>there be a good little dessert spot down the street name david 's .<ssssss>
2 2 3 3 4 2 4 2		disappointed the room be smaller than it appear on the picture from the book site .<ssssss>as i check out , i be inform that i be go to be charge for internet access , safe use , and telephone access .<ssssss>i be very disappointed when i find this out because if i would have know , i would have make use of these amenity .<ssssss>also , there be no parking in the area , so you have to pay $ 28 a night to park valet .<ssssss>you can avoid this if you park on narrow side street , but you also run the risk of get a parking ticket .<ssssss>
1 1 3 2 3 -1 1 -1		steal handbag from room - travelodge hotel sydney wentworth ave we stay here for 3 night and have we handbag steal from inside the room .<ssssss>-lrb- nov 24th -rrb- the swipe card be not work and it be change at reception early that morning .<ssssss>handbag be steal in the next 3-4 hour .<ssssss>-lrb- between 5am and 9am -rrb- after report the incident to the hotel they be not very helpful except to tell we to go to the local police station to report the incident .<ssssss>-lrb- surry hill police station . -rrb-<ssssss>the hotel staff say the room must not have be lock properly but they could not demonstrate how the door could be leave unlock without someone hold it open or place a object between the door and the door frame .<ssssss>-lrb- door be design to close automatically due to its weight -rrb- they wouldnt even come up to the room with we to show we how this be possible.there be even implication from staff -lrb- not all -rrb- member that we might have misplace the handbag.some staff even imply that unless we can prove it be steal then we could just be make it up .<ssssss>-lrb- btw we have no travel insurance so we take the loss -rrb- i ask the duty manager if this sort of thing have happen before at this hotel.he reply he be not authorise to comment on that .<ssssss>-lrb- what do that mean ??? -rrb-<ssssss>we report it to the poilce but they be no help .<ssssss>they just give we a police report number and tell we they be quite busy and could not come to the hotel .<ssssss>we hope it be not a inside job but we have no help from the hotel to explain how anyone can get access to inside a lock room.we be very disappointed with the unwillingness of staff to investigate the steal handbag and explain to we how a handbag can be steal from inside a lock room .<ssssss>the security at this hotel be very poor.there be no security camera on the floor , card access to the elevator be possible to all floor and not restricted to just one own room floor.there be one security camera at the front entrance and they be not go to review the footage anyway.it would be possible for anyone to walk in and ride the elevator to any floor they desire.but how anyone can get access to a lock room be what have I most worried.we advise people to be cautious when stay here and when thing go bad you will not get too much help.only share these experience will hopefully force hotel like this to upgrade security and also to not brush off incidence like this.i hope no one have to go through the nightmare we have to go through which include organise a new passport and cancel credit cards.i know that these thing do happen but the way the staff handle this situation and they attitude and unwillingness to help be what really leave a bad impression and disappointed uswe can provide the room number where the thief steal the handbag from on request<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 5 2 4 5		overrated !!!!<ssssss>while i think this place probably deserve to be in the top twenty of hong kong , i do not quite get the number one ranking here - its exaggerated !<ssssss>i book the langham place in hk precisely because of the review it get here at tripadvisor -lrb- sucker !<ssssss>:p -rrb- but if i be to return , i would feel indifferent about return to this hotel.things i like that probably make its ranking on the high side : * good concierge service for restaurant reservation .<ssssss>the guy be not able to get we a table at the restaurant we want on the exact day we want , but we truly do appreciate he effort on get back to we with a alternate date and time .<ssssss>then he even leave message for we to remind we of this reservation .<ssssss>nice .<ssssss>* room service be also good .<ssssss>very courteous and prompt and they get the detail right .<ssssss>yummy burger and fries , i might add .<ssssss>* basically they get the smart phone thing right .<ssssss>everytime you pick up the phone for a question , to order food , or for any request , they be very polite in answering , helpful with any question , and they would act on request or order immediately .<ssssss>the people be well train in this area .<ssssss>* although the size of the bathroom be small-ish , the bathroom experience be very pleasant with a separate tub and shower and there be two shower option , the rain like one that above the head , and the hand hold one .<ssssss>toiletries smell yummy .<ssssss>* conveniently located near a mtr station , no need to go outdoors .<ssssss>this be really good since it be rain while we be there .<ssssss>-lrb- but since i dont have business in the mongkok area , be not sure i would stay here again -rrb- .<ssssss>still better to stay at tsim sha tsui area , central , causeway or even wanchaus , so you be in between central and causeway bay .<ssssss>* the ihome be a nice touch : -rrb- now about the not so desirable thing : - the langham patrolman .<ssssss>this guy in the lobby who make it he job to see if anybody in the lobby be misbehave .<ssssss>im serious , i think this be really he job .<ssssss>i have to wait in the lobby since room wasnt ready , so i go to the mall and get myself a coffee and look around .<ssssss>i return to hotel and it be still too early , so i just sit there in one of the chair which have a table beside it .<ssssss>i put my coffee on the table and start search for something in my bag .<ssssss>then ... .<ssssss>mr langham police come and say , sorry , but you arent allow to put down you coffee at the table .<ssssss>that be really bizarre ... i think that be what table be for !!!<ssssss>so i ask why ?<ssssss>and he say with a really apologetic face , i really dont know but those be the rule .<ssssss>sheeesh , if that be he job and he have to do it everyday , he might as well know why , right ??<ssssss>ok that be not a isolate case .<ssssss>on a separate occasion , sit in the lobby again , this guy be reprimand for sit on the arm part of the chair , since there werent enough chair .<ssssss>and on another occasion , there be this lady beside I who be sort of fill she nail .<ssssss>now this be really weird , file you nail in public .<ssssss>but apparently , she break she nail , so it be sort of necessary at that time .<ssssss>and of course langham patrol guy come and tell she that filing be not allow .<ssssss>and she say , but i break my nail , and he say , can i see ??<ssssss>so bizarre .<ssssss>this lobby police thing be really a first for I , and its really weird .<ssssss>they make you uncomfortableon you own holiday.-i have to agree with the other guy that the check-in service be not quite good .<ssssss>first off you be welcome at street level by these girl in hot pink outfit , and pink hat .<ssssss>i be not sure if i could blame my mood upon arrival , but it be just a tad annoy that they try to make chit chat which i find a little bit contrived , like it be all a part of a script or something .<ssssss>go back to check-in , we arrive almost noon time , so this could be the reason that the queue feel like a bank queue , seriously .<ssssss>i mean standing in line isnt exactly jolly when you have have just come from a flight .<ssssss>there be probably three lane and in each lane there be about three person in line .<ssssss>then when it be my turn to check in , the lady in the unapollogetically tell I that we have to wait until two pm to get the room .<ssssss>it wasnt she fault really that check in time be really at 2 , but it didnt help either that she have a look that feel like she just want to get I over with and get to the next person in line.-room size : tiny .<ssssss>the size be similar to european style hotel room .<ssssss>for hong kong standard this be really small .<ssssss>no need for a huge plasma tv really , as the bed be close to the wall in front .<ssssss>room have 2 single bed .<ssssss>there be really no option to get 2 double bed in room since they dont have any.all in all , market place-like check-in experience plus langham police guy really ruin it for I .<ssssss>i be not sure this be a five star hotel .<ssssss>probably a four star yes .<ssssss>if you feel the need to stay in mongkok or have business there , then this be probably the best option there be .<ssssss>otherwise , there be so many other option in hk .<ssssss>by the way , another reviewer mention he pay usd95 per room per night .<ssssss>at this price , i think its worth it .<ssssss>in the end , i think the level of enjoyment come relative to price pay , so since i pay more here , and couldve pay less at similar level , better situate hotel , my satisfaction level be only at 80 % level .<ssssss>

1 1 2 3 2 3 1 3		very disappointed my boyfriend and i travel with friend and stay at the ocean sand golf beach resort from april 18th to april 25th 2006 .<ssssss>we have stay at all inclusive resort in cuba and the mayan rivera several time with no problem that we would bring to anyoneâs attention .<ssssss>check in : upon arrival check in go pretty smooth although we have request a adjoining room which we do not get or a king bed .<ssssss>we stay in 8112 and we friend stay in 8114 .<ssssss>room : we stay in villa 8 as it be close to the pool and beach and only a short walk to the buffet and main lobby .<ssssss>we stay on the main level room 8112 and 8114 -lrb- main floor -rrb- .<ssssss>room be not bad , but not 5 star quality in we opinion .<ssssss>i really be not a picky person when it come to travel , i realize that we be go to other country and some thing will be out of sort .<ssssss>upon arrival in we room the safe be lock and need to be reset so we could use it .<ssssss>it take the staff 4 day to come and re-set the safe after many phone call .<ssssss>we have to use the safe in 8114 .<ssssss>the signature brochure show that the minus fridge be stock daily and we receive 2 minus beer and a couple of water the day we arrive and after that we have to pay for it .<ssssss>we would leave money in the fridge and they would take the money and not leave the beverage include bottled water .<ssssss>one night we have come back to room 8114 and notice that the bathroom have flood from the ceiling .<ssssss>water soak the entire bathroom and there be sand and rock that fall into the shower/tub .<ssssss>we use every towel to clean up the mess and think it would be a one time occurrence but it happen a couple day later but this time the entire bathroom ceiling bow down and explode with water .<ssssss>they take the ceiling slat down and it gush everywhere .<ssssss>obviously they have plumbing issue in this hotel .<ssssss>we also notice that we bedding be not change while we stay there and the room be never properly clean .<ssssss>i do not think they clean we bathroom once the entire 7 day .<ssssss>the phone in the room only work on and off .<ssssss>8112 have major crack in the ceiling and for the resort only be a year old the inside of the room lack serious maintenance.power outage : the first time the power go out it be around 8:00 pm until 12:30 am .<ssssss>the entire resort be pitch black as they have no back up lighting .<ssssss>people be scramble look for they toddler in the dark .<ssssss>we have to go into the a la carte restaurant and take candle off the table so we have some light and not know how long it would last .<ssssss>when the electricity go out , so do the water .<ssssss>no water in the sink , shower or toilet for several hour .<ssssss>we have to use we garbage can to get water from the fountain to put into the toilet tank so we could flush .<ssssss>the next day the power go out again around 4:00 pm when people be get ready to shower up for dinner and again no water .<ssssss>we see people shower in the pool and one lady use conditioner in she hair and rinsed in the pool .<ssssss>the power come back on a hour later but the water stay off for over 3 hour .<ssssss>we do not have any more episode during we stay .<ssssss>the power outage be only we resort , the other be fine .<ssssss>restaurant : the buffet be the best by far .<ssssss>there be a lot of choice and we do not have any problem .<ssssss>we try the mexican restaurant and the food be not edible .<ssssss>we take one bite each and walk out and go to the buffet .<ssssss>the italian restaurant be not much better but we eat a bit and then go to the buffet for some more .<ssssss>the restaurant be like they have all the meal pre-made and they serve it buffet style from the kitchen as you get it within 10 min of sit down at you table .<ssssss>there be one restaurant down by the beach which be pretty good , we have the beef tenderloin and we enjoy it .<ssssss>beach/pool : the pool be fine , but the beach be super noisy with motor boat and helicopter constantly run by .<ssssss>at the beach they rope off the area where you can swim and it be pretty narrow .<ssssss>we could not go past the buoy or you risk lose a limb to the crazy boat driver !<ssssss>lot of seaweed and they do not clean up the beach .<ssssss>there be plastic glass and straw everywhere .<ssssss>i be not impressed .<ssssss>staff : the staff aim to please .<ssssss>they be friendly but keep to themselves or would just say they do not understand and walk away .<ssssss>i be surprise that the resort allow the royal holiday people to stand outside the buffet and try to talk you into buy into they time share .<ssssss>one couple we know do attend the 1.5 hour session and get a free massage but they want you to drop $ 16,000 we on you credit card right then and there as the deposit and then pay the remainder later .<ssssss>we have terrible experience every day be ask by staff member if we want to purchase cocaine or marijuana from they .<ssssss>the security guard be the worst - very persistent - this be not acceptable and i inform max -lrb- we signature rep at the resort -rrb- of this problem .<ssssss>overall i would give this resort a 2 out of 5 base on we experience .<ssssss>again , we have be to several all inclusive resort and never complain once and have a fantastic time .<ssssss>to pay over $ 4200 for two people plus spend money on top of that , you be better off stay at another hotel and not take the chance at this one .<ssssss>it be funny that signature vacation will not recommend certain excursion off the resort as they be not safe or worth the money in they opinion , but they still will list and recommend this resort in they travel brochure .<ssssss>i be extremely displeased with this trip and file a report with signature vacation .<ssssss>it be my belief that signature should pull this resort from they package .<ssssss>
4 4 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		the good stay here a few night with my two son , aged 10 12 .<ssssss>the good - the room be beautiful and big , the breakfast be great , and the view be wonderful .<ssssss>the location be ok - would have be better in the summer/spring as it be too cold to walk too far .<ssssss>the traffic , due to the construction , in this area be still tough .<ssssss>mass transit be not really a opinion because the nearest train station be close during we visit.the bad - we have a unruly guest in the room next door wake we at 3 am .<ssssss>extreme profanity and scream .<ssssss>i call security and no one respond .<ssssss>finally , i call the room myself and thing quiet down .<ssssss>as a mom that travel alone with my kid , security be important .<ssssss>i be not impress by the non-responsiveness of the staff - it be a good thing nothing really serious happen !<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		sound for the pound can not beat the location or price .<ssssss>we have no problem with noise , go to bed late and get up early to go off sightseeing so this be maybe why but that be why you come to barcelona .<ssssss>why would you want to go to bed early or sleep in late ??<ssssss>the decoration may be date but be very clean and the vend machine that sell beer be a winner .<ssssss>breakfast be good , unless you be expect a full english , but guess what it be not england !!<ssssss>would return , spend four packed day 's and night in barca but still so much leave to see .<ssssss>

4 4 4 2 5 5 4 -1		napoleon be very nice , a little out of the way .<ssssss>i book through expedia -lrb- hotel and airfare -rrb- from london , for four day at around $ 850 .<ssssss>so unfortunately i be not too sure of the exact room rate , but we choose the standard basic room .<ssssss>we be on the first floor above the lobby and face the courtyard .<ssssss>the room be tiny , tiny , tiny .<ssssss>but !<ssssss>the bathroom be a good size .<ssssss>the room be very hot and we be try to figure out how to make it colder , but then we realize that the french door on the side of the room open and let in cool air !<ssssss>it be not a problem in february but i can see this be a problem in the summer .<ssssss>not sure how the ac work .<ssssss>they have turn down service each night , the chocolate be delicious .<ssssss>we do not spend much time in the room b/c we be see the sight , so at most we sleep there .<ssssss>the bed be very firm and the pillow nice .<ssssss>i think i would have prefer a softer bed , but no big deal .<ssssss>i be so exhaust from tourist , that it do not really matter.the room be immaculately clean .<ssssss>the bathroom be very nice .<ssssss>the picture other reviewer post be accurate.the elevator be very small and slow , so we just take the stair .<ssssss>also the hotel staff be very friendly , speak perfect english and very helpful with direct we towards the airfrance bus .<ssssss>the bus be very convenient to take from the airport cost about 15 euro a person .<ssssss>take it to the end to the arc stop , and walk a few block ... the price for food in the restaurant be very expensive so we just eat outside the hotel .<ssssss>brioche dore be a very inexpensive option just around the corner on the champ d'elise .<ssssss>the view from the street in front of the hotel have the amazing view of the arc .<ssssss>however , it be far from the other tourist attraction , such as the tower , notre dame , museum , etc. the hotel be nice , but too out of the way for we .<ssssss>next time , i will stay somewhere more centrally located .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 3 5 4 2		very good hotel , great bed but watch out for the extra cost of parking very good hotel .<ssssss>the other review prior to this review be accurate both the good and the bad comment .<ssssss>i pay $ 78 for a standard double bed .<ssssss>the bedding be wonderfully fluffy with just the right amount of back support .<ssssss>the decor be also nice for the price .<ssssss>the room be very large .<ssssss>everything from the shampoo to the coffee be upscale .<ssssss>there be a starbuck in the hotel plus several nice restaurant .<ssssss>if you can get a room face the pond , then you will get a nice nightime view of the business park in the area .<ssssss>this hotel look like its website photo .<ssssss>my room be a very clean , but a bit ragged .<ssssss>the chair have tear , the lamp have large splattered stain , and the corner lap do not work .<ssssss>the bathroom be a plain bathroom .<ssssss>the bed be full size , not queen size so 2 people per bed would be a tight fit .<ssssss>this be what i wish i have know before i book this hotel to improve my stay : first , the parking to this hotel be far from the entrance .<ssssss>across a small street be garage parking .<ssssss>the cost be $ 10 flat fee for unlimited parking .<ssssss>save all you ticket so that you can turn they in at the end of you stay .<ssssss>for a one night stay , it would have be better for I to park in the free parking lot on the side and back of the building and haul my luggage inside .<ssssss>the valet be young and enthusiastic .<ssssss>if i be less able or not be on a tight budget , i certainly would have use they help .<ssssss>second , the room be rather wear , like at a much lower quality hotel .<ssssss>i would not have expect more.third , i would have try to negotiate a lower price from the hotel before book it on line .<ssssss>they have lot of avalable space during my stay .<ssssss>the previous 3 night i have stay at the fairfield in across the highway which to I have equally good bed , free breakfast , indoor pool , a workout room and nice staff .<ssssss>on this night the fairfield inn be charge $ 99 per night so i think $ 78 at the hilton have get to be better .<ssssss>it be not .<ssssss>i do not have a bad stay , but it be not all that i expect .<ssssss>maybe stay on the higher floor -lrb- we be on the 6th floor -rrb- would have give we better quality and have a higher budget for tip would have give we better service .<ssssss>as someone pass through , i do not want to pay for internet service , so i use my phone as a modem which be slow .<ssssss>there be a business center in the hotel but it be so far away , i be too tired to make the trip .<ssssss>finally , i wish that i have know that this hotel be part of a complex of building that be link together make this hotel a city all its own .<ssssss>the entrance be breathtaking .<ssssss>travel in jeans and a t-shirt , i feel completely out of place -- until nighttime when i see other people in jeans and regular shirt practice they music in the lobby and kid play in the outdoor pool .<ssssss>many people wear business attire because they be come and go from work whereas my work have end .<ssssss>while i would definately stay in this hotel again only if i have a great rate .<ssssss>this hotel be like a taste of texa for visitor to the state and i recommend it for visitor to the state , to dallas , or for anyone want a good bed only if they get a great rate or they pay more for a better room and have a good budget .<ssssss>trip advisor customer review have be great in help I pick good hotel for several year , and i hope this review help other in they decision make process .<ssssss>
1 2 1 3 1 3 3 2		do not judge this book but it be cover .<ssssss>dont be fool by the pretty pic .<ssssss>the hotel do seem like it be modern and well mantain from the outside , but once you get inside you room it be all over.the room need to be much , much more cleaner -lrb- bathroom horible -rrb- .<ssssss>i have a ocean view room that i pay x-tra as a upgrade and the window be so dirty that i could not see any sign of the ocean .<ssssss>i call the front desk and they tell I that they contract a window cleaning company and they be not shedule to come during my stay at the room .<ssssss>believe it or not i go to walgreen across the street and buy a bottle of windex and use a coat hanger as a extention and stick my hand out of the window and clean the window my self .<ssssss>i do alot of travel and never write a review before , but i think this hotel need to be know for it wolf in sheep skin .<ssssss>i be write this review and be very honest .<ssssss>please beware .<ssssss>

3 2 4 4 4 3 1 3		multiple personality disorder service we book a room at the roosevelt for a girl 's night out in hollywood .<ssssss>i have to say that the service resemble a person with multiple personality disorder .<ssssss>the valet check in be more than polite , they be both extremely nice .<ssssss>we towel boy and server during the day at the pool be outstanding .<ssssss>however !<ssssss>at 11 am there be no chair available around the pool -lrb- the hotel allow local to come use the pool without check key , i know because i be local and i have friend who do this -rrb- .<ssssss>so we be relgate to a sectional couch at the back , a nice spot but unfortunately shady .<ssssss>at 4 pm we be inform we section be go to be cordon off for vip and that we would have to move .<ssssss>this be after spend the afternoon and $ 300 + from the bar/restaurant .<ssssss>the staff be inform if they could find we seat around the pool sit together we would move , but that aside we be not leave until 5 .<ssssss>they leave we alone for the most part after that.going back up to we hotel room to ready ourselves for dinner , one of my friend bring a beautiful bottle of champagne for we to drink while do so .<ssssss>call room service i be tell they would not send we up flute or even wine glass , but we could call the pool and they might send we up some plastic flute .<ssssss>-lrb- whatever -rrb- .<ssssss>the pool send up plastic beer cup .<ssssss>um , no !<ssssss>i send the poor man back downstairs for either plastic flute or glass glass .<ssssss>the thought of my friend in term of service versus labor cost , they have to endure 3 phone call and 2 trip on the part of the server to finally send we up glass wine glass .<ssssss>if they have do it the first time , it would have be far less hassle in term of time and money .<ssssss>either way you slice it , it be ridiculous.i do have to say that the room and we view be gorgeous , they supply be with fresh brand amenity -lrb- my personal favorite -rrb- , the sheet and towel be all top quality -lrb- even though some of the towel have a ritz-calrton label -rrb- and we have a wonderful time .<ssssss>this hotel need to offer in the way of service what it can offer in the way of fun .<ssssss>and it would be nothing more simple than common consideration and even just attend to the most simplistic of request .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 4 4 4 3		big be not always beautiful firstly i should explain two thing .<ssssss>i be a diamond card holder with the hilton group which enable I to receive upgrade on room .<ssssss>secondly my wife and i be well travel and neither of we will see 50 year old again.this resort be big .<ssssss>too big to cope with the number of people stay in the 5 tower -lrb- each a hotel -rrb- which comprise this resort .<ssssss>another tower be be construct for vacation club subscriber .<ssssss>the ` village ' also include about 50 shop and restaurant , which provide some on site fun , but the main ` high street ' be only a 10 minute walk away and be amazing in its size and quality of shops.our room be great .<ssssss>on the 34th floor out of 35 and with a nice balcony with a sea view .<ssssss>the room be a good size but be not well insulate .<ssssss>the door mechanism be so robust that you have to slam the door to close it .<ssssss>you will hear door slam shut at least 3 room either side of you .<ssssss>if there be boisterous people above you you will hear then through the ceiling.you will need to be sharp to get a seat around the pool .<ssssss>there be not enough sunbed and each one be but against the one next to it so there be no privacy and , frankly , you have to be careful if the person next to you suddenly flatten the sunb as finger could be hurt .<ssssss>the beach be not part of the hilton village so you will need to hire sunbed for the beach at about 10 pound a day .<ssssss>reed mat can be buy cheaply at the on site supermarket.the breakfast arrangement be awful and you will find yourself queue for up to 20 minute to be seat for breakfast .<ssssss>not a good start to the day , but a opportunity for one person to queue and the other to reserve a sunbed.there be no executive lounge -lrb- for the information of cardholder -rrb- .<ssssss>entertainment be provide several time a week , always at a cost.this resort come at the end of a week in hong kong and 2 week in sydney and we be lucky with the weather .<ssssss>it provide a warm and relatively attractive recuperation after 3 week of non stop activity and sightseeing .<ssssss>it tick many of the box need but the aforementioned deficiency mean that i would not go there again .<ssssss>
1 1 2 4 2 4 2 -1		very sick well we really dont have many nice thing to say about this hotel , except the beach be amazing!first off , this hotel be more like a 2 star , not a 4 star , be room be ready when we get there , that be nice , but as soon as we get in be room we find be tolet over flow , we book a king room , with a stock fridge , and a balcony not a garden view , well we didnt have anything in the fridge , it be turn off , we have two double bed , and we be on the ground floor.we call front desk , about the toliet , they show the next day , that wasnt so hot!but someone do come three time that day , because they never fix it.and when it do work it be only temperary , this be funny one morning we have be own pool in the washroom!well needless to say we use the lobby washroom.the food , well ... salty .<ssssss>.<ssssss>like crazy , selection .<ssssss>.<ssssss>they have they if you like food with you salt.on day three of be seven day stay both my husband and myself spend the rest of be trip in the washroom and in bed , and we be not the only visiter who get sick.the food be not well protect from insect and not change often at all , buffet start at 6 and end at 10 ... so the food be out all that time in the heat and bugg !<ssssss>.<ssssss>.<ssssss>we have be to the dominicain three time , and this hotel be horrid !<ssssss>staff be not to bad , but not very helpful , kid love the hotdog !!!!<ssssss>oh and we didnt not drink the water even bottled water for brushing be teeth!we strongly recommend if you do go here bring you own food !<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 2 3 1 -1		`` we will not take responsibility '' i recently return from a trip on which i take 22 other people , 18 student and 4 other adult , on a trip to puerto rico .<ssssss>we stay at the howard johnson on isla verde because of its price and location .<ssssss>it cost we $ 4,800 for five room for five night .<ssssss>when we first arrive we be pleasantly surprise by the nice lobby and the nice pizzeria on the ground floor .<ssssss>when we get to we room they be a nice size , very long and spacious .<ssssss>the bathroom on the other hand be so small you could barely turn around without hit the shower curtain or counter top .<ssssss>there be spot on the floor and back of the door , which think about they now it make I gag .<ssssss>i think we room be decent , but when i go to check on the other room in my group i realize by room be smaller , have no microwave and my tv have only 5 channel while the other have standard cable channel .<ssssss>we watch disney channel every night , for some reason it make the cut .<ssssss>do not stay in room 406 !<ssssss>the next day , every room have be service by housekeeping except for mine .<ssssss>apparently they take a break and complete the room after 4pm .<ssssss>this be very inconvenient because most excursion be over and you be head back to you room at that time .<ssssss>we have houskeep knock on or door two or three time to see if we want it clean .<ssssss>we repeatedly tell she yes , but not while we be in it .<ssssss>each day we have to call for towel bc we room have not be clean , and each day it take about 30 minute to get they .<ssssss>this housekeeping deal be a daily occurence .<ssssss>the worst part be that on day three , one of the girl have she wallet rummage through and $ 130 steal .<ssssss>we tell management , they come to the room , check to see who have be in it accord the to the card key printout , etc. this , for some reason , take they hour to complete .<ssssss>it be ridiculous .<ssssss>they call the maid into the room and ask she if she have take anything .<ssssss>duh , like she would say yes !<ssssss>so after hour of this they say , when you get you key you sign a release say we be not responsible for lose or steal item .<ssssss>why do they have to put on the show if they be not go to do anything about it ?!<ssssss>the next day , a young man in another of we room have he entire wallet steal .<ssssss>i call the manager and he say i be personally in the room with the maid today while she clean .<ssssss>i respond by say , you can tell I that all day long , but i be not here to see it so it do not matter .<ssssss>they also say , this maid have be with we company for a long time , bla bla bla .<ssssss>although the roll away bed be free , you sit on they and go straight to the bed frame .<ssssss>i literally sleep on metal bar for 5 night .<ssssss>the last complaint be that although we have 4 or 5 people in each room we be only give two breakfast voucher for each morning .<ssssss>we could not even use they because we be not only go to take 10 member of we group to the crappy breakfast each morning .<ssssss>it be not a good experience .<ssssss>do not stay there if you want to keep you belongings , you need to stockpile the towel , and bring clorox to clean you bathroom .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 4 4 4 -1		the good hubby i stay here for a few day in november 2007 .<ssssss>my biggest problem be we room .<ssssss>we be on the 2nd leg of we journey but if i have the energy i would have ask to be move .<ssssss>we room look most like the photo of the room do in red , black and white without the red velvet couch in we room .<ssssss>it be very very small .<ssssss>we be face the street and it be a bit noisey at times.the thing that bother I the most be the bathroom be very date .<ssssss>on top of that the wall paper be actually peel .<ssssss>i be so dispapointed that i can not remember what room # it be becasue apparantly after read other review , there be some newer and nicer rooms.i feel we pay too much for the particaulr room we get .<ssssss>now on to the good : location location location !<ssssss>also , the wine hour be very nice and i do not even drink wine .<ssssss>a hot tip from the bell boy : arrive in the lobby about 10 minute before wine hour begin .<ssssss>they usually bring in a deep dish pizza from the restaurant which be go in a flash .<ssssss>we do and enjoy it very much .<ssssss>in the morning a nice touch along with coffee and hot tea be hot chocoalte .<ssssss>now would i stay here again ?<ssssss>well ... maybe .<ssssss>if i get a really nice room like some of the other writer describe with a fridge too ... perhaps ... i still wonder if another hotel in the same area would have be a better deal .<ssssss>the other thing that i find disappointing be i can not remember the exact detail but something like the charge they quote for parking -lrb- very pricey -rrb- be even more than that because there be some sort of a tax ...<ssssss>
2 1 4 2 3 1 2 4		expensive with bad service level my husband and i stay at the cosmo hotel over a weekend in early october .<ssssss>the room be very small and the staff unfriendly .<ssssss>location be not close to much except the hk convention centre -lrb- abt 10 min cab ride -rrb- .<ssssss>it be a 15 min walk to the nearest train station -lrb- wan chaus -rrb- and food outlet be near the station .<ssssss>we pay hkd 1,800 + 13 % tax and yet have a tiny room .<ssssss>we have previously stay in many hotel in hk and this have the be the worst value for money give the service level and room size .<ssssss>
4 5 5 2 2 5 5 -1		great experience overall except for the location great experience overall .<ssssss>the only real negative be the location .<ssssss>there be not much out there within walk distance or be the neighborhood really conducive to walk .<ssssss>you really need a car to go anywhere.staff be extremely helpful and pleasant .<ssssss>the breakfast and manger reception be great and way above you standard complimentary breakfast deals.a minor negative be the room be a little dirty - neat and tidy but the cleanliness could be improve , e.g. feel like there be sand on the sheet underneath the cover and there be pubic hair in the bathroom and bathtub .<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 4 5 4 2		great start to we honeymoon we stay here for 4 night at the beginning of we honeymoon .<ssssss>we have a one bedroom suite overlook circular quay and the harbour bridge and could not have be happier with the view or the room itself.with the ferry , train and bus right outside the rest of sydney be at you doorstep .<ssssss>great restaurant nearby -lrb- although a little pricey -rrb- and perfect for stroll round the harbour , botanic garden and the cbd.local calling be very expensive - use you mobile !<ssssss>
4 4 3 4 5 2 3 -1		good value say here april 9 , 2007 .<ssssss>great location for shopping .<ssssss>room be very clean , though a little worn around the edge .<ssssss>the parking be $ 47 -lrb- for a suv -rrb- for a 24 hour period but you do have in and out privilege and that be quite reasonable for sf .<ssssss>valet staff be very courteous .<ssssss>overall for what we pay , it be a great deal and i would stay here again .<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		nice , but you can hear the other guest my husband and i book a king suite at the hotel drisco for we wedding night after hear wonderful thing about the hotel from we photographer .<ssssss>the interior be lovely -lrb- perfect for take get ready shot for the wedding -rrb- .<ssssss>everything be clean and fresh look and staff be pleasant .<ssssss>my parent be a bit dissapointed that after order a bottle of champagne to be deliver to the room after the wedding , the staff deliver the champagne too early .<ssssss>when my husband and i arrive to we room there be champagne in a bucket with water -lrb- no ice as it have all melt -rrb- .<ssssss>i have to say , i be a bit dissapointed as well because the staff know that it be we wedding night and i feel should have go above and beyond to make sure thing be nice for that very reason .<ssssss>for example , when my husband and i be out of town celebrate we engagement -lrb- at a different hotel -rrb- the person at the front desk send a complimentary bottle of champage up to we room to congratulate we .<ssssss>the hotel drisco staff do not make any attempt to help we celebrate we wedding day or make it a extra special stay .<ssssss>after a long night of party at we wedding we be ready to sleep in and order breakfast in bed .<ssssss>no such luck !<ssssss>the second the person above we wake up , we could hear they walk to the bathroom , flush the toilet , run the sink , etc. we be up at 6am after get to bed at 2am -- not the bliss i have in mind for my first day as a married woman : -rrb- you really can hear the other hotel guest -lrb- and we have a corner room so i guess it be not as bad as it could have be . -rrb-<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 5 5 5 -1		not bad i stay at the aparthotel silver for four night last month -lrb- april 2008 -rrb- .<ssssss>i be travel with my mother , who have not be to barcelona since 1989 , so i be hope to find somewhere nice to stay - but not too expensive -lrb- we be on quite a tight budget -rrb- .<ssssss>unfortunately it seem to be a very expensive time to book a hotel in barcelona , possibly because of st george 's day , but we manage to find room at the hotel silver for a reasonable price .<ssssss>on each floor of the hotel there be 2 room face onto a internal courtyard which be not open to the sky -lrb- there be a panel of small glass square at the top -rrb- and because we opt for the cheapest room , these be the one we get .<ssssss>i find it a bit strange not have any natural light in the room at all , and as it be quite warm and the air conditioning be not allow to go below a certain temperature , it do get quite hot and stuffy .<ssssss>-lrb- there be a electric fan supply in each room , but mine be slightly faulty and my mother 's do not work at all . -rrb-<ssssss>but it be a comfortable room , with a kitchenette -lrb- which we do not use -rrb- and a fridge , and the bathroom - although small - be clean and have a good shower .<ssssss>the little box of chocolate leave for we on the bed be a nice gesture.the hotel staff be very friendly and helpful and the breakfast , serve partly in the bar and partly in a kind of marquee go out into the garden , be good - pastry , jam , cheese , ham , toast , fruit , cereal and typically strong spanish coffee.the hotel be in the gracia district of barcelona which be a very nice neighbourhood , busy and attractive without be too touristy .<ssssss>i would definitely stay at the hotel silver again , although next time i would save up for a outside-facing room .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 1 2 3 -1		not good !!<ssssss>i have rename this hotel the hotel manawful !!<ssssss>the decor in this hotel be very , very shabby .<ssssss>sorry , that be a understatement .<ssssss>there be cleanliness issue and the room i stay in be as basic as i have ever experience .<ssssss>the furniture be old and fall apart , the bed have no headboard and bed basis be uncovered and grubby .<ssssss>if you be scare of lift then come here !<ssssss>you can climb it be many twist , narrow staircase all day !<ssssss>not all room have en suite bathroom , mine do fortunately !<ssssss>on the positive side it be central and the pillow be very soft .<ssssss>my room be face the front onto main street which be noisy but it do not bother I much .<ssssss>if you want no frill and the backpacker appeal that this hotel have then this be the place for you .<ssssss>it be cheap but i do not think it represent value for money .<ssssss>check out fire exit and escape route .<ssssss>
2 5 2 3 5 2 3 5		mixed feeling i have mix feeling about this hotel .<ssssss>there be some very good point about it , like the view of hong kong harbour , but there be also some annoying quality , mainly related to design.the hotel have a sleek , modern architecture , which be in sharp contrast to the off-the-beaten path neighborhood in which it be located .<ssssss>the lobby be located one floor up from street level , which give you something of a immediate respite from the roar of hong kong .<ssssss>the hotel have a small footprint , but it go up , up , up .<ssssss>the elevator seem capable of handle the hotel 's traffic ; there be only one morning where i have a significant wait for a elevator .<ssssss>despite the vertical rise , i find this hotel to have a intermittent noise problem .<ssssss>a sound something like a vacuum cleaner would cycle on and off even through the night .<ssssss>my room be very narrow .<ssssss>so narrow , in fact , that i could not comfortably sit at the desk to work at my computer because the foot of the bed come so close it do not allow I to pull the desk chair out far enough .<ssssss>i find it easier to sit on the end of the bed to work on the desk .<ssssss>i find the shower also very small .<ssssss>there be no room for a tub .<ssssss>the design seem to attach maximum priority to give as many room as possible a harbour view.i note my concern in the hotel 's checkout questionnaire and receive a immediate response from the hotel 's management .<ssssss>they note that they do have larger room .<ssssss>in that i be stay in one of they platinum room i wonder if i would have need to stay in a suite to get more space?the staff in the hotel be inconsistent .<ssssss>some , like the concierge , be extraordinarily helpful .<ssssss>other , in the restaurant or behind the front desk , be decidedly unhelpful , even sullen.the quality of the food in the restaurant be very good .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet selection be somewhat limited , but adequate.bottom line , i think the panorama need to try a little harder , compensate for the built-in design problem , the location and the highly competitive nature of the hong kong hotel market .<ssssss>it also need to correct the noise problem and work with the staff more .<ssssss>if it do all these , i think it would be on par with other hong kong hotel .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 3 5 2 -1		not what it use to be we stay for 10 day around christmas 2007 and new year 's 2008 .<ssssss>this be we second visit ; we first be in 2005 when the facility be own by secret .<ssssss>we like the dr due to the nice people , the reliable weather and the diversity of guest -- american may be the largest group , but more than half the guest hail from the rest of the world , which we like.the beach be beautiful and the facility be pretty well keep up , consider the tropical nature of the climate .<ssssss>public restroom be almost always pristine .<ssssss>the room could use a freshen -- the linen be dingy and threadbare -lrb- have anyone at excellence ever hear of tide detergent ? -rrb-<ssssss>and there be not enough light in the shower room or by the sink .<ssssss>the excellence club be not worth $ 50 per person per day for a miami herald and more selection in the minibar.the food be prepare well , available in copious quantity and have something for everyone , although meat-eater will likely feel more at home .<ssssss>serve condition maintain food safety -lrb- my wife if the original kitchen cop . -rrb-<ssssss>the theme restaurant be a nice touch , and there be not many wait .<ssssss>we miss the french restaurant because management be in the process of renovation and relocation during we stay.the biggest gap compare to secret ownership be that the staff have be reduce .<ssssss>this be especially noticeable at the meal service , where get a glass of water , a cup of coffee or a glass of wine can be a exercise in patience .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and want to do a good job but there be not enough of they .<ssssss>a section with 10-15 two-top would have two , maybe three server who do everything -- set up table , handle service , clean up and bus they own table .<ssssss>they work in team but it often be not clear who be responsible for what .<ssssss>when patience fail , i find that get up and walk towards the service bar would invariably bring someone running .<ssssss>the bar service be very good , with top shelf product available and the entertainment be also appropriate.bottom line -- there be new place open up in 2008 and 2009 which will likely get we dollar when we return to the dr. this facility be still a bit better than ok , but it be also quite expensive .<ssssss>when it be own by secret , it be head and shoulder above the rest -- now the gap be substantially smaller .<ssssss>
2 2 5 4 4 1 3 1		false advertising and lie !!!<ssssss>but good location and nice room .<ssssss>this be we first time visit san juan , puerto rico .<ssssss>book we room online via they website and call the hotel 4-5 time personally to ask specific question about we reservation and ammenity of the hotel .<ssssss>the people who answer the call be very nice and promise we get the type of room we ask

lounge , live music , or club in the hotel .<ssssss>we opt to stay here due to the special promotion they have via they website which save we a couple hundred buck .<ssssss>after a very long flight over to san juan and upon arrive to the hotel we find ourselves at what be the temporary check-in area .<ssssss>only one person at the desk and upon check in the guy tell we that there be no room available that we reserve and that we would have to take a single king bed with a inflatable bed instead for the night .<ssssss>that be not satisfactory to we so we demand something better .<ssssss>he go to the back and suddenly a room with a double bed become available .<ssssss>there be no apology and he say that reservation be only a preference and not gauranteed !!!<ssssss>they have only one elevator work the whole time .<ssssss>the other one be out of order .<ssssss>i do not understand why they do not fix this problem .<ssssss>the wait be long for the elevator and it get very cram .<ssssss>the hotel staff also use this very same elevator as well which explain why it would get very cram .<ssssss>the elevator problem should have be a top priority to fix asap .<ssssss>we be give a room with the view of the lagoon which be very nice .<ssssss>nicely renovate room .<ssssss>comfy bed and pillow .<ssssss>the ac work nicely but have trouble try to fix the temp on the panel that get stick .<ssssss>the bathroom have very nice fixture and the shower work great .<ssssss>the cleaning people be always very nice .<ssssss>we want to watch a movie .<ssssss>call downstairs and they inform we that we tv be not hook up to be able to watch the movie of we choice .<ssssss>it be a bummer .<ssssss>we order room service once and it be a super rip off , outrageous !<ssssss>the girl who take we order be very rude and to top it off we bill come out to around $ 70 for three people !!!<ssssss>upon ask for a explanation it be simply say that the price be what the computer make it to come out to .<ssssss>that be the last and only time we order room service.the italian restaurant have the nicest staff .<ssssss>very friendly and very helpful .<ssssss>the dinner dish be great and taste like the pasta be just freshly make !<ssssss>it take a bit longer than expect for the food to come to we table but well worth the wait .<ssssss>tony roma 's be just alright .<ssssss>jose be the best server there .<ssssss>he give we tip about the town and it help a ton .<ssssss>long wait for food there too and they tell we that they be out of hamburger bun for we order .<ssssss>starbuck across the way be perfect for we breakfast need .<ssssss>even see a famous spanish soap opera actor in there !<ssssss>the location of the hotel be right in the middle .<ssssss>we hop onto the bus to catch a ride to old san juan -lrb- only cost 75 cent each way -rrb- and the bus stop be right in front of the hotel .<ssssss>also get onto the same bus to get to plaza las americas , the gigantic mall in hato rey .<ssssss>save a lot of money that way than take a cab everywhere .<ssssss>very very convenient as far as location go with the hotel .<ssssss>convenience store across the street come in handy as well as the big souvenir shop down the street .<ssssss>subway down on ashford for a cheap dinner be nice too .<ssssss>they have all kind of nice little bar/restaurants on the water and also the fancier more expensive restaurant too like ropa vieja -lrb- cuban -rrb- and ajili mojilus -lrb- puerto rican i be guess -rrb- .<ssssss>they also have a big chili 's on ashford too .<ssssss>i be glad that i do not stay in isla verde , too far off from everything but the airport .<ssssss>to get to the pool we have to cross the overpath , pass the casino , pass the italian restaurant , walk through the cold , paint smell pathway and take the elevator down .<ssssss>the elevator do not work at time so we have to take the star and instead of it go down to the pool , it would go all the way up to the 10th floor and come back to the pool area .<ssssss>very odd how the elevator work in the hotel .<ssssss>must get that fix !!!<ssssss>the pool be very nice and open all the time .<ssssss>they have one main pool and also a saltwater pool which seem like a nice add touch .<ssssss>they need more lighting for the pool area at nighttime .<ssssss>could barely see anything in the pool area at night which could be very dangerous for the kid .<ssssss>the jacuzzi be big and always available .<ssssss>happy hour have cheaply price drink at the pool bar which be nice .<ssssss>david the bartender make great drink , but need more help during happy hour which get very busy .<ssssss>they block off the entrance to beach in the evening time which seem strange , but there be access another way it seems.they be currently do contruction on the other side of the street which would be the location of the cafe and the main lobby of the hotel .<ssssss>the man at the front desk claim that all of they room have be renovate which seem to be true .<ssssss>hopefully in a year all the contruction will be do and everything will be work properly and open .<ssssss>if not other hotel down the street would be a option for sure next time !<ssssss>puerto rico be absolutely beautiful and can not wait to come back again !!!<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 3 5 5 3		great service have a very nice 4 day stay .<ssssss>the hotel be older and if you look closely you will notice a few nick and scratch around , but generally nice facility .<ssssss>everyone be very nice - front desk , reception , concierge , valet , housekeeping , bar .<ssssss>i be very impressed with the consistently friendly service .<ssssss>oh , one complaint be the low-flow showerhead .<ssssss>yuck .<ssssss>but what do i know , maybe dalla be have a drought.the aquarium be a easy walk -lrb- 2 or 3 block -rrb- and be great .<ssssss>the west end neighborhood be also a easy walk and have lot of restaurant option -lrb- lot of steakhouse , no surprise , but some other option too -rrb- .<ssssss>would definitely stay here again .<ssssss>

4 5 5 2 4 4 4 4		great room , not so great location we stay at the omnus for one night .<ssssss>it take we about 1.5 hour to get from a relatively close location to there .<ssssss>not that that be unexpected , because the hotel be downtown .<ssssss>however , it be kind of a drag .<ssssss>the hotel be also not in the nicest area of town .<ssssss>it be not a terrible section of the city , but not a great one either .<ssssss>the hotel 's lobby be not very welcome .<ssssss>have say all of that , the room be very nice .<ssssss>it be quite large and have a tub and shower in the bathroom .<ssssss>the bed be extremely comfortable .<ssssss>the 2 restaurant be very nice , as be the outdoor pool .<ssssss>the hotel also offer a towncar service , which can become useful , although it will only go to location within a short distance .<ssssss>the front desk be fairly helpfull .<ssssss>overall , mainly because of the very nice room , a nice night 's stay .<ssssss>if you be look for a charming hotel ; this isnt it .<ssssss>however , if you be look for a nice , quiet , comfortable place to sleep downtown , this may be you hotel .<ssssss>

2 4 2 5 2 2 2 1		not very clean , not very friendly i book this hotel for one very important reason - they have kind of not too expensive parking charge -lrb- about $ 40 per day which be good for ny -rrb- , and they say that i can open a window in the room .<ssssss>honestly , this be very important to I , i can not stay in the room with the sealed window , i get completelly sick , so i always call to the hotel before i do any booking .<ssssss>anyway - out of all manhattan ' hotel i choose this one only because they promise that i wouold be able to open a window -lrb- a little bit ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>well , it be not true .<ssssss>when i come - they be very friendly , and they pre-register I at 10 a.m. assure I that my room will be ready by 1 p.m. it be not true either .<ssssss>it be not ready even at 3 p.m. -lrb- official check - it time -rrb- .<ssssss>i be able to get my room only at 4 p.m. it the building look nice from outside , and the lobby be nice too , but inside - you feel like you be walk ramada hotel .<ssssss>not very nice , not very clean .<ssssss>the room have very limited furniture , you feel that one little table at least be miss .<ssssss>the bed be noisy and not comfortable , shake on the high leg .<ssssss>do not expect any nice pillow either .<ssssss>everythign be minimize , but - sure enough - you have that expensive mini-bar with the key , so they can charge you more .<ssssss>the toilet be not clean , the actual toilet have dirty stain all over , the water from the sink be leak , and the water in the shower do not go away .<ssssss>the view howere be terrific , but the window be seal , you can not open it so you stay in the air-conditioned room without ay fresh air , and after a night sleep in such a room you head be heavy and you nose be stuff , and you have slight cold flu symptom .<ssssss>i come to the reception and i talk to the manager marco who say that they have other room where the window can be indeed open , and he say that they will move I .<ssssss>but = guess what - they do not .<ssssss>when i come to the reception again - marco be not there , but there be some other girl , and she be rude , she be roll she eye like i be ask for a moon from the sky , and she do not even apologize , thus .<ssssss>.<ssssss>it be not very nice .<ssssss>the hotel be full of child , it look like thay be havee some group deal overe there , but you do not expect to be right in the middle of the high school when you pay so much for you stay .<ssssss>you feel like you be camp with the bunch of boyscout .<ssssss>if you do not mind it - sure you can choose this hotel .<ssssss>if you do not mind rude stuff - sure you can choose this hotel .<ssssss>but if you prefer to get a decent service for the money you pay - stay away , this be not a good place .<ssssss>and even you wonderfull view from the seal window do not help .<ssssss>i also ask for some help to book some tourist tour - and receive no assistance .<ssssss>the restaurant be of low quality and sure enough - overprice .<ssssss>you do not mind to pay more for a good food in ny , but when you pay $ 60 for piece of meat you expect it to be a good piece at least - but it be not .<ssssss>the food be of dennis ' quality .<ssssss>i would say - this be 2 star motel in a body of high glass building , that be it .<ssssss>the only advantage be - the location .<ssssss>it be really comfortable .<ssssss>you be right in the middle of midtown , easy walk distance to everything you want to see in ny .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 4 1 1 1		avoid the kapok hotel !!<ssssss>terrible customer service !<ssssss>we stay at the hotel kapok in beij for 11 night during the olympic game in august 2008 as part of we honeymoon .<ssssss>we have pre-book the accommodation -lrb- a courtyard room -rrb- about 9 month in advance use asiahotels.com/hotelclub.net and have a pre-paid voucher for the entire stay with us.we arrive after a long 15 hour trip and present the voucher to the front desk manager .<ssssss>after examine the voucher for about 20 minute due to a lack of english language capability we be inform that the hotel would not be honour the voucher since the rate that we have pay be too cheap since it be the olympics .<ssssss>apparently we would be able to stay in the hotel for 2 night only before need to move out .<ssssss>we explain that we have pre-pay and book the accommodation in advance and the fact that the hotel have agree to the rate then mean that we have a valid contract to stay at the price we have pay .<ssssss>the front desk manager check we in for 2 day say she would try and extend we stay.at this point we contact hotelclub.net in australia and request they to sort out the issue and they say they would follow up on this .<ssssss>approximately two hour later we receive a call from the front desk say we will need to move out of the hotel since government official have book all the room and we would not be able to stay in the hotel .<ssssss>again we inform hotelclub about this .<ssssss>over the course of the next 2 day we be hassle by the hotel staff to the extent that they send porter to we door to try and remove we luggage from we room , whilst hotelclub be very ineffective in resolve the problem .<ssssss>they resolution consist of try to move we to a lower grade hotel which we reject or to a sister hotel of the kapok that no one have hear of .<ssssss>both of these option be not satisfactory to we .<ssssss>as far as we be concern the issue be between hotel kapok and hotelclub to sort out as regard rates/bookings etc. we have a valid confirmation voucher and be now be evict from we room.in the end hotel kapok manage to find we another room where we could stay which be of a lower standard then we have book -lrb- a regular room vs. a courtyard room -rrb- and do not have any window , only a roof light .<ssssss>moreover , the bathroom be surround by clear glass and unlike the courtyard room which have a curtain to surround the bathroom , we second room do not have this and be clearly mean for single occupancy only .<ssssss>to add insult to injury throughout the time we be there , we do not see a single government official and the only other occupant we see be western tourist .<ssssss>clean staff also confirm that the room be empty and there be no reason for all the problem we have experience that waste 2 day of we honeymoon and ruin the start of we beij visit.no apology , explanation etc. have follow from either hotel kapok or hotelclub .<ssssss>in addition , when we be check out , the front desk staff try to charge we again for the night we have stay at the hotel despite we again present the pre-paid hotel voucher .<ssssss>it take another 30 minute to sort this issue out.overall , i would recommend avoid this hotel as the level of customer service be sub-standard consider the rate they charge and i would recommend at stay at one of the well-known brand whilst in beijing -lrb- e.g. the grand hyatt , regent hotel , peninsulta etc. -rrb- as the locally-owned boutique hotel still have a way to go with regard to they understanding of customers.this be a shame as the hotel have a lot of thing go for it : cleanliness , excellent location for shopping on wangfujing and visit the main site in central beijing -lrb- forbid city , tiananmen square , temple of heaven etc. -rrb- .<ssssss>we be both seasoned traveller and this be the first time that i have really be shock by the standard of service and respect for customer , and will be follow up with the management at both hotelclub.net and hotel kapok to re-iterate we concern about the treatment we be subject to .<ssssss>

2 1 3 -1 3 -1 1 -1		overprice and underservice i recently stay at the san juan paradisus on a business related trip and overall i would have to say i be extremely disappoint with the experience .<ssssss>i find the service lack , the food unexciting and the entertainment boring and unprofessional .<ssssss>for the price they charge , they should be deliver more of a 4 star experience.details : - check in - although i have to wait about 45 minute for my room -lrb- i arrive before check in time -rrb- , the royal service receptionist be very nice and accommodate .<ssssss>my butler take I by trolley to my room and be attentive .<ssssss>however , i do not see he again for the rest of my stay .<ssssss>- room - the room be nice with the usual upscale hotel room accommodation .<ssssss>nothing particularly special .<ssssss>pool - very nice , particularly the royal service pool .<ssssss>i be there in the middle of the week and the pool -lrb- and the resort in general -rrb- seem to be only about 20 % full .<ssssss>iâm tell that weekend bring a lot of local and the pool can get quite crowd .<ssssss>the royal service pool attendant give the best service we experience .<ssssss>- restaurant - for a all-inclusive , there be a profound lack of selection and the food be average at best .<ssssss>buffet be not particular large and selection be very limited .<ssssss>the stir-fry or pasta station be 15 people deep with a 20 minute for a cook to order dish .<ssssss>in a wait restaurant this would be acceptable but not at a buffet .<ssssss>much of the buffet food be cold and some do not seem fresh .<ssssss>my group of 10 request a 7pm reservation at romantico and be tell they could only accommodate we at 6:40 .<ssssss>fine , we arrive at 6:40 to and empty restaurant that wasnât near half full at 7:00 .<ssssss>why couldnât they have just honor we 7pm request ?<ssssss>the food at romantico be good but there just wasnât enough of it .<ssssss>portion be ridiculously small .<ssssss>-lrb- 2 escargot appetizer , 4 very small lamb chop , a sliver of cake . -rrb-<ssssss>i be hungry after dinner .<ssssss>there be no food option on the beach like the sandwich shack you find in other all - inclusive .<ssssss>room service be a joke .<ssssss>very limited menu with tiny portion .<ssssss>three of four in my party tell I they order room service when they get back to they room -lrb- still hungry after dinner -rrb- and after 45 minute they order be deliver incorrectly.service - while they seem to try , my impression be they just donât really know what good service be .<ssssss>-lrb- i.e. - staff go above and beyond to exceed you need and ensure you have a memorable stay -rrb- .<ssssss>they do the minimum amount possible to deal with you or you situation and then move you on .<ssssss>sometimes we werenât even tell the truth in they attempt to move we on .<ssssss>my impression be that the service be fine until there be a problem or a challenge and then they simply donât want to deal with it .<ssssss>i find this with the concierge , front desk , bellman , bar and in the restaurant .<ssssss>for the rate they charge , they should have a better attitude .<ssssss>they should drown you in service and go out of they way to make you feel special.entertainment - other than a cheesy lounge singer and the casino , there be none .<ssssss>overall : a disappointment .<ssssss>for these rate at a suppose 4-star hotel you should get the feeling that they want to make you happy .<ssssss>the food should be abundant and higher quality .<ssssss>i will not be return .<ssssss>

2 1 2 -1 1 -1 3 -1		beware the hype ... i look around for a hotel a week before stay in london .<ssssss>i usually use a 5 * one at london bridge , but want to be in the west end .<ssssss>i trust all the review of the chesterfield as they have pay off for I before .<ssssss>but it be not as good as people say .<ssssss>i pay Â£150 for a king size -lrb- negotiate from Â£187 -rrb- - one of they very recently redecorate ` large ' room .<ssssss>well , i honestly could not swing a cat in it - the window be tiny and be next to the noisy air con vent .<ssssss>the wall be drape in burberry cloth , which may have cost a lot , but we name it the chav suite immediately !<ssssss>anyway , the worst thing - the king size bed be 2 singles push together .<ssssss>so , i have we move to a room with the biggest bed on offer - a queen size !<ssssss>the room be bigger and quieter , but i couldnt stand up under the shower - the ceiling be very low and then they cleverly put in a victorian style vertical drop shower , which be lower than my shoulder !<ssssss>staff be friendly and polite and the location be good .<ssssss>apart from that - do not bother .<ssssss>i wont be go back .<ssssss>for the money you can get much better than the chesterfield .<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		comfortable we just return from a business trip to the hyatt this past weekend.our room be very comfortable and very spacious.the food in the italian restaurant be very good as we go with the nightly special .<ssssss>the food at the revolving restaurant be excellent as be the service , although it be a little on the expensive side.the view be spectacular.the only thing that the hotel could improve on be seat in the main lobby -- there be a couple of chair and a couch and alot of empty space .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 3 3 3 1		$ 10 extra to use the pool ?<ssssss>the room we be in be 100sq foot really small with a huge 36 flat screen tv that would blind we .<ssssss>love the big tv but it be not even high def .<ssssss>the matress have a rubberized plastic cover over it that would make the sleep on a wet life raft sound anytime we move .<ssssss>it also make we sweat all night .<ssssss>the bathroom still have salmon color tile just like grandam 's house on floor and wall from the 1970 's .<ssssss>but worst of all they want a extra $ 10 to use the pool/workout room .<ssssss>we would not recommend stay there .<ssssss>there be nicer place right across the street that do not charge for pool use .<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 2 3 3 -1		need to be much more !<ssssss>we travel to bali quite often and normally stay in the hyatt in nusa dua or the intercontinental but decide that we would give the ritz carlton a try as we have read a lot of good review here!well i have to say we will not be go back !!!<ssssss>for what it cost it be certainly not value for money!we book a club room but be advise on check in that we 10 year old daughter would not be allow into the club lounge !<ssssss>so there be a total waste of money !<ssssss>we be inform that we could take breakfast in padi -lrb- where everyone else have breakfast ! -rrb-<ssssss>the only difference i can see between the club room and the standard be that with the club you get a designate floor to check in and the lounge , which we could not use!the room be no larger than any other room in bali !<ssssss>though the standard room in hyatt be much bigger and much better value for money!the food and drink poolside be astronomical but i have to say that the poolside staff be very good and attentive most of the time , though ritz carlton need more poolside lounger !!!<ssssss>on 2 occasion we could not get a bed ... now if i be pay $ 580 a night i expect to be able to sit by the pool!the hairdryer in we club room overheate every 15 seconds of constant use and then i have to wait 10 minute for it to cool down , i request a new one from housekeeping and they send I a 350 watt hairdryer -lrb- the normal wattage of a hairdryer be 1200 -rrb- so it be like someone breathing on my hair , no power no heat , i request another yet this never materialise ... these be essential item in hotel room !!<ssssss>the amenity be good though the shampoo and conditioner be awful and leave hair feeling dry .<ssssss>the whole resort white towel and facecloth need to be throw away as my whole 4 night stay i only get 1 white fluffy towel , the rest be that lovely wash out grey and hard type that you expect when pay $ 50 dollar a nightthe martini lounge be amazing and the staff be what you expect in a 5 * hotel ... .<ssssss>padi restaurant be good but again i have eat better thai food!we go to sami samus the italian on we 1st night and that be ok !<ssssss>though the bottle of wine we order cost a amazing Â£110 for a Â£20 maximum bottle elsewhere!if you look for a real balus feel then this be not the place , you could be anywhere ... .<ssssss>we also book a hotel car to take we to ku de ta one evening to see the sunset and have dinner , we have to wait over 15 minute b4 we car arrive and subsequently only get to see the very end of the sunset .<ssssss>.<ssssss>if i book a car for a time then i expect it to be ready .<ssssss>.<ssssss>this to say the least be not my idea of a great resort , i have stay in the ritz in hong kong , dubai -lrb- which be amazing and should be try -rrb- and kuala lumpur but to be honest i will not be rush back to stay in the ritz bali anytime soon!i think they need to take a very long hard look at what they offer and make some severe change !<ssssss>
4 5 4 2 3 3 4 3		good deal 1 -rrb- the room be clean , good size , and very reasonably priced2 -rrb- the complimentary breakfast be very satisfactory - and its include in you stay !<ssssss>even better !<ssssss>they have make you own waffle , really good !<ssssss>, hot egg , potato , bacon , sausage , bagel and toast , pastry , fruit , cereal , etc. awesome buffet for free ... oh , and i need to mention that 24 hr a day they have hot water and assorted tea , seattle best coffee and decaf for free in the lobby.the one downfall that no one warn I about : the location be only so so .<ssssss>you be right next to a freeway entrance basically - we have a lovely view of the 5 ... or the 405 ... whatever it be .<ssssss>one thing the hotel do provide be a shuttle -lrb- that run until 9pm -rrb- that go downtown , to the space needle and the seattle convention center on the hour and will pick you up as well about a quarter past the hour .<ssssss>-lrb- downtown be about a 3 minute drive , or about 6 block from the hotel - not bad ... a cab ride be about $ 5 -rrb- .<ssssss>last but not least , there be complimentary internet which be always convenient - and its not hard to connect to , which be a plus as sometimes hotel make it really difficult to access they internet system ... definitely recommend this hotel b/c the price be so reasonable for all the amenity - i would just recommend possibly look into other option more centrally located so you can walk out you door and into the heart of downtown - rather than look out you window at rush hour traffic .<ssssss>
2 -1 4 5 3 -1 2 3		continue it be slow slide downhill .<ssssss>my partner and i stay for the 5th time at the kahala in late september.it be we anniversary , so obviously a special trip .<ssssss>we double-check as do we travel agent , that the hotel know it be we anniversary , request a upgrade which be one of the perk through booking at my agent 's company , and that we be past guests.when we arrive the receptionist have simply no idea what be go on , she be as they typically be at the desk , pretty lame .<ssssss>she do not even know there be two of we in the room although we show she we confirmation .<ssssss>she look at we like we be speak a foreign language when we ask about the upgrade and mumble something like i have no information on that and basically just try to get we to move away from the desk.however , when we arrive in the room , there be a bottle of champagne wait for we .<ssssss>there be , however , no note to explain who send it .<ssssss>i be not sure if it be from a friend wish we a happy anniversary , or if it be from my travel agent or if it be from the hotel thank we for we repeat business or even acknowledge we anniversary .<ssssss>nada .<ssssss>zip .<ssssss>and no welcome back note , even though we have one the last time .<ssssss>what give , do not they have procedure in place to acknowledge they past guest who continue to spend $ $ $ there?the thing i notice about the hotel be that most of the staff be friendly but they do not do much .<ssssss>you can never get the lady at the reception desk to do anything out of the norm , i.e. have a late check-out .<ssssss>twice during the stay we room be not clean even though we leave at about 8am and return well after 3pm .<ssssss>we generally phone housekeeping to let they know we be go since this have happen before but this time it be pretty bad .<ssssss>they also have this really nice area overlook the dolphin lagoon and pool call the verandah where you can have high tea and snack or just appetizer and drink .<ssssss>there be usually a nice breeze and it be very relaxing and romantic .<ssssss>the last time we be there in the spring they have some great edemame but when we ask about it this time the girl just flatly tell we they stop offer it but no other alternative .<ssssss>the staff at the verandah usually consist of 1 -lrb- one -rrb- college girl who have to serve about 20 table both in and outside so she be usually pull pretty thin and subesequently the service be not always the best or the fastest .<ssssss>that be the thing - the kahala seem to not have too many staff member around other than the valet guy , who rock by the way !<ssssss>it be like they be try to cut cost by have as little staff available as possible.true , it be a beautiful property but still you go there for the almost private beach , the larger room but ultimately service .<ssssss>there be not much service lately and it be get worse .<ssssss>the staff , have take , to always say hello to you as you walk by they but that be the extent , they do not go the extra step and for a property that charge as much as they do , they really need to do so.we love the beach and the privacy but we be go back to the halekulanus .<ssssss>it be not as large but they ooze service and they do the little thing .<ssssss>lot of amenity in the bathroom like mouthwash and constant replenishment , free internet , they learn you name .<ssssss>basically they be a 5 star hotel and they act like it.i do write the general manager of the hotel .<ssssss>he reply back with a single paragrah say it be unfortunate that my check-in experience at reception be not good .<ssssss>duh ?<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 4 2 3 5		just okay ... we visit the vibe in north sydney from november 15th - 21st .<ssssss>this motel be nice and very centrally located - right across from the train station and also very close to the ferry at luna park .<ssssss>we get there at 10:00 a.m. the reception area seem very nice .<ssssss>we tell they we know we be early , but wonder what time we could check in .<ssssss>the lady at the front desk tell we about noon a room would be ready .<ssssss>so , after a 17 hour plane ride , we decide to go get something to eat just down the road .<ssssss>we walk back at noon and they tell we that the housekeeping still do not have it ready and it would be another hour .<ssssss>so , we walk to a friend place that be nearby .<ssssss>we wait to come back until 2:30 and still be tell that the room be not ready !<ssssss>i get a little testy with they and they take we up to the bar to have drink on they until it be ready .<ssssss>well , needless to say i go back down at 3:00 and still not ready .<ssssss>they be then go to show we upgrade for the hotel - so we take they tour and would not you know we initial room be ready !<ssssss>so , finally at 3:45 we be in we room !<ssssss>what service ... the room - basic - we have a nice view of the harbour .<ssssss>the bed be nice -lrb- r -rrb- than some hotel .<ssssss>the lighting be not the greatest by the bathroom/mirror .<ssssss>the shower door be only a half door , which i do not understand and so of course we floor be soak each time we get out of the shower!we never eat at the restaurant there and so i can not really say much about that.otherwise just a okay hotel .<ssssss>nothing too great except for the location ... would recommend it only for location .<ssssss>
2 2 4 5 3 4 2 3		sadly not quite good enough for a hotel of this calibre , not to mention price , we be disappoint with several aspect of we stay .<ssssss>the location and view may be inspiring from the guest room , but try get a cab at any time of the day or night and the doorman will advise you to ` walk up the road and try at the four season ; taxi do not like come here ! '<ssssss>not a great recommendation for a five-star hotel , especially if you be wear high heel .<ssssss>we pre-booked morning newspaper fail to materialise and take 45 minute to resolve ; a pre-booked and much-needed massage appointment at the spa be mess up and we be simply advise to ` come back later ' .<ssssss>and the parting gift be a additional $ 75 bill , send by mail , because the housekeeping staff have incorrectly tally we minibar account.all in all it be a thoroughly ordinary experience , despite the view of the opera house .<ssssss>if you be contemplate a stay at this hotel , consider the four season instead -lrb- where i have also stay and have much better service -rrb- !<ssssss>
4 2 5 5 4 5 5 -1		fun family vacation in the sun !<ssssss>we spend a week at the majestic colonial with extend family from february 16 to 23rd .<ssssss>we be a group of seven , include two child , aged 3 and 6 .<ssssss>among we , we have travel in the past few year to cuba , mayan riviera , barbado , and jamaica .<ssssss>when we book the holiday , we be thrill with the review on this site and be get more concerned in the month before we left.check-in go well - we be greet with cool towel and a majestic drink and two of the three room be ready - the third within a hour or so.i e-mailed richard before we leave and we accomodate we with three room next to each other and away from the construction .<ssssss>he be on lunch break when we arrive and when i go later to thank he , he be disappoint to not have bring we to the room .<ssssss>he be very helpful with a number of special request and take care of we right away .<ssssss>very friendly and professional - thanks richard.roomswe all have champagne in the room on arrival -lrb- nice touch -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be large and clean .<ssssss>we have a king size bed and a couch and cot for the kid and there be still plenty of room .<ssssss>none be musty - the tropics be humid .<ssssss>as discuss , the bathroom be open concept , which be fine for we , but would not suit everyone -lrb- and would not be great if you be sick -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be clean well -lrb- although the time do vary -rrb- and we leave a tip for the maid with a little gift daily .<ssssss>we never have bug and maybe one mosquito .<ssssss>the air conditioning work really well -lrb- we have to turn it down daily -rrb- - just remember it turn off automatically if you patio door be ajar .<ssssss>the fridge be stock daily.we do have a pipe come apart under the sink when we first arrive , spilling water over the floor .<ssssss>it take three call to have it repair .<ssssss>on the other hand , when we safe would not open and we call , someone be there to fix it in under 10 minute .<ssssss>this be a big resort.i will try to describe the lay out - there be four row of room run from the lobby to the beach .<ssssss>each of these building be 3 - 4 story high and the room be number with the lower number close to the lobby and buffet and the highest number -lrb- 50 , 51 , etc be oceanfront -rrb- .<ssssss>build one look towards the neighbor resort .<ssssss>the room closest to the lobby would likely have be have to listen to the loud theatre from that resort which face those room .<ssssss>building 2 run along the pool -lrb- and the first floor be the swim-out room .<ssssss>we be in 2227 -lrb- second floor , half-way down -rrb- which be great .<ssssss>this be quite close to the pool bar and cocktail hour activity , so be a bit noisy in the afternoon .<ssssss>this do not bother we as we be not in the room much during the day and the noise end promptly at 6pm .<ssssss>build 3 border the walkway and be probably the quietest -lrb- although the room closest to the lobby would be border the majestic theatre -rrb- .<ssssss>build 4 face the construction of the new majestic next door.there be a fair bit of walk , from beach to room to lobby area .<ssssss>the access from room to the lobby and buffet be cover , which be nice when it rain -lrb- do not worry if this happen - even when it look awful , it be sunny and clear within a hour -rrb- .<ssssss>there be elevator everywhere .<ssssss>it be one of the more accessible resort that i have be to .<ssssss>grounds and lobbythe lobby and grounds be beautiful .<ssssss>there be always people work on the property .<ssssss>they do appear to use a lot of pesticide and we be a little concerned to not see any wildlife -lrb- only one gecko the whole week -rrb- and bird in cage .<ssssss>this be we preference though , and i know that if they do not do this , people would complain about bug - can not please everyone.poolwe be more beach people , but this be a unbelievable pool .<ssssss>it be huge and never seem crowd .<ssssss>there be plenty of spot to have a quiet swim or to hang out by the swim-up bar .<ssssss>the temperature be good for we and the depth be perfect for the kid .<ssssss>the pool be spotless -lrb- they must have be clean it while i sleep -rrb- .<ssssss>we do notice some of the tile start to detach and as other have mention , the concrete around the pool be break in a few area - they will be have to do some maintenance.beachthe beach be beautiful .<ssssss>the water be clear and blue and warm .<ssssss>fun wave to play on and the best sand-castle sand i have ever see .<ssssss>be careful outside of the roped swimming area - my husband snorkele around the area and see lot of spiny sea urchin - just watch you foot .<ssssss>he snorkele quite a bit from the beach and see lot of fish -lrb- and when he go quite a way out , even a ray ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>boogie board be fun and if you walk to the leave down the beach to the undeveloped area , there be some great body surfing -lrb- a bit rough for the kid -rrb- .<ssssss>take a walk and enjoy the undeveloped beach - it will not be there long !<ssssss>although we never have a problem get each chair or palapa we do find the beach a bit crowded and as people follow the sun and the tide move in , people be more in each other space .<ssssss>the constant helicopter tour be a bit annoying , but not the hotel 's fault .<ssssss>they could use another bathroom close to the beach - it be a long walk to the restaurant bathroom -lrb- especially with two kid who can never coordinate they trip -rrb- .<ssssss>i would agree with other that they need more soap dispenser and towel holder in the public bathroom .<ssssss>they be always empty.foodoverall , the food be fine .<ssssss>you would have to be pretty picky to not find anything to eat .<ssssss>lunch be the least selection -lrb- although we only ever go to the beach restaurant - great view -rrb- .<ssssss>we be happy to not see fries and hot dog and burger at every meal , but other might complain ... .<ssssss>chicken be great , check doneness if they be busy though .<ssssss>breakfast be awesome .<ssssss>some dinner at the buffet be better than other - beef be generally overcooked , but there be always good pasta and meat or seafood cook to order -lrb- lamb , salmon , squid and shrimp -rrb- .<ssssss>we also eat dinner at the steak -lrb- great steak - which be not expect in the carribean , and pork chop -rrb- and we all have good meal at the seafood .<ssssss>dominican/mexican be pretty good , but salty .<ssssss>my brother go to the gourmet , which he say be great and three people go to the japanese , which they say be just okay .<ssssss>-lrb- two of that party get very sick the follow day , but can not say for sure it be the food -rrb- .<ssssss>it be nice to not hav eto make reservation -lrb- especially with the kid -rrb- , but they be eager to get you move out at the steak ... .<ssssss>one note - we be travel with a child with a severe peanut allergy and be very pleased with the response and care at the resort and restaurant .<ssssss>i have e-mail in advance and richard prepared small card for I to show the restaurant staff , explain the situation simply .<ssssss>he explain the situation to a guest service person who e-mail the restaurant to advise that there would be a person with a food allergy .<ssssss>the card be well receive -lrb- do not ask the wait staff , find the manager or chef in the restaurant -rrb- .<ssssss>we be very impressed that they consult the kitchen and carefully bring we around the buffet or walk we through the menu for safe food .<ssssss>two manager even introduce themselves to my daughter -lrb- age 6 -rrb- and assure she that they do not want she to get sick - this be exceptional service in we experience , even here in canada .<ssssss>there be lot of option -lrb- we stay away from dessert as a precaution and bring we own treat -rrb- .<ssssss>there be lot of water available - they will give you bottle at any bar on request and several in the room .<ssssss>heed the warning and do not drink the water and do not brush you tooth with it -lrb- can not say this be the cause , but we two sick group member do brush they tooth with tap water -rrb- .<ssssss>we eat salad and fresh fruit all week and drink drink with ice and be fine .<ssssss>do bring some pepto along , in case you get some traveler stomach - i be a bit queasy a couple of day , but nothing unmanageable.entertainmentdidn ' t go to any show or casino , so can not comment .<ssssss>there be live music on the outdoor patio near the buffet every night which be nice and fun for a after dinner night cap .<ssssss>we go out one night and the lobby bar be busy and social , although i do not think that this would be much of a party resort and would not suit young singles or couple look for a bar or dancing scene .<ssssss>there be lot of child -lrb- include ours -rrb- , so if this be not something you be comfortable with this might not be the right place for you - there be no adult only section of the resort .<ssssss>that say , despite the number of kid , the kid club look awful and i would not have leave my kid there .<ssssss>the castle and water slide look to be in disrepair -lrb- and maybe a bit unsafe -rrb- .<ssssss>we peek in when no one be there and the indoor set-up look better - clean play area for craft , game and some videogame -lrb- if that be you interest -rrb- .<ssssss>we see a few kid at lunch with staff and they seem to be have fun , but i would not have be comfortable with it .<ssssss>it be at the very front of the resort , away from everything , in the sun and too far from where i would be - but that be I .<ssssss>lot of stuff to do with the kid anyway on the beach so we have fun .<ssssss>bring you own beach toy if you can - they will charge you a lot there and its worth it to have the sand toy and a float chair.servicewe find the staff throughout the resort friendly and helpful and especially great to the child .<ssssss>these people work very hard and be away from they family for close to two week at a time at the hotel camp area .<ssssss>acknowledge they work with a thank you or a hello go a long way .<ssssss>i notice complaint about language barrier on this site - you be go to a spanish-speaking country , so people there speak spanish .<ssssss>-lrb- just a note to one lady i witness at a bar - speak loudly and painfully slowly in english do not equate spanish or make you more understand ! -rrb-<ssssss>invest in a traveler dictionary and/or learn a few key phrase and it will be appreciate and very useful.sorry to be a bit long-winded , but hope its helpful .<ssssss>overall a great trip !<ssssss>the resort will have to do some maintenance to keep they rating .<ssssss>

4 4 3 5 3 4 5 2		have stay almost 170 night in this hotel as a frequent business traveler to this hotel , i feel i must dispel some of the myth of the previous review and provide a bit more insight into the hotel , when to stay there , and who to ask for when you have a problem.the hotel be in a perfect location for visit boston .<ssssss>to begin , fenway be roughly a 15-20 minute walk through a nice area to catch a red sox game .<ssssss>if you need ticket , just go across the street -lrb- literally -rrb- to the hilton where youâll find a small window that sell game day ticket at face value , best keep secret in boston .<ssssss>the hotel be also attached/part of the biggest mall in boston , so if itâs a rainy day , no worry , spend you day explore the exceptional shopping -lrb- i.e. tiffany , loui vitton , guccus , neimanâs , sakâs , etc. . -rrb-<ssssss>and various mid-priced restaurant .<ssssss>additionally , there be two t stop located in the mall , so transportation to anywhere in boston -lrb- and the outskirts -rrb- be a breeze , and again , you donât even need to go outside if itâs nasty .<ssssss>also , thereâs a starbuck in the lobby and dunkin donut in the mall about 100 foot away.for those day where the weather be sunny and the temperature be right , boston common be short walk east down boylston .<ssssss>on the way youâll pass abe loui steak house which i feel be overprice for what you get -lrb- why in the world youâd eat steak in boston be beyond I â?keep in mind i live in chicago -rrb- and they sister restaurant the atlantic fish co. which be tasty , but expensive.newbury street and they excellent shopping and restaurant be the next street north of boylston so again , youâre roughly a block from one of the biggest shopping destination in the we .<ssssss>again , this place be about location , location , location.onto the hotel , when you come in for check in , if the line be long , or even a few people deep , use the check in kioskâs .<ssssss>theyâre quick , easy , and if youâre a spg member you get a bonus 500 points.the top four floor of the north tower be the club floor , with the large club room on the 29th floor .<ssssss>have stay , or have co-worker that have stay , in a vast majority of the sheraton property in the we , this club room be at the top .<ssssss>itâs large and provide and extensive continental breakfast , include three cereal , fresh blueberry or raspberry , strawberry , melon -lrb- s -rrb- , yogurt , cranberry , apple , and orange juice , milk and coffee , pastry , bagel , etcâ he staff be excellent and very helpful and if you need a extra bottle -lrb- or four -rrb- of water or diet coke for you room there very happy to oblige .<ssssss>please note , they always have glass and mugâs , etcâ âve stay in the hotel -lrb- four day a week -rrb- for over a year and one week where they change out style do they provide paper cup .<ssssss>finally , there be two computer with internet access in the club lounge so if youâre on a club floor and only want to do a few quick search , donât pay for internet and just use the club lounge.now , be a platinum spg member iâm always upgraded/given access to the club level so i wouldnât know what the upgrade cost be , but i imagine if itâs less than $ 20 - $ 25 per person -lrb- if you work out -rrb- , itâs worth it for the savings on breakfast and workout facility .<ssssss>the evening hors d oeuvre be ok , they always have a desert cake or pie , two app , fresh veggy and dip , assorted cheese , and mixed nut .<ssssss>plus , the drink arenât necessarily cheaper , but pour a lot harder in the club room.as far as the hotel room on the club floor go , theyâre ok , nothing really exceptional that separate they from the rest of the hotel .<ssssss>mostly youâll feel like you walk into a polo ad , the only real difference be that you get bottled water for free , access to the lounge , a more upscale -lrb- note i do not say larger -rrb- bathroom , and most importantly free access to the workout/pool facility -lrb- a $ 10 per person per day value -rrb- .<ssssss>the rest of the hotel be nice , if youâre expect the ritz , donât , youâre not pay ritz price .<ssssss>if you want the ritz , stay at the ritz .<ssssss>this be a very nice sheraton by nationwide sheraton standard and if you get a good rate here youâll be happy.with regard to problem , come from someone who spend roughly 150-160 night a year in hotel , this place do a incredible job at take care of the guest .<ssssss>donât be fool by any other poster , iâve stay almost 170 night in this hotel alone , any issue or problem i have be resolve immediately , and if it wasnât i be credit bonus point , rate reduction , free room , etcâ ften time the problem be resolve immediately and i be still credit bonus point .<ssssss>plain and simple , if you have a problem , donât be a jerk , but go down to the front desk and politely ask for the manager , explain the problem , and it will be resolve asap.as with anything in life , there be problem or con , here be a few of mine .<ssssss>first , the cable selection and tvâs be pretty basic .<ssssss>there be 15-20 channel -lrb- one movie channel -rrb- on a 27 inch tv , not horrible , just not good or great .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny ; if you need a large bathroom , request a handicapped room .<ssssss>otherwise , they be very small , unless you happen to get one of the two-three room suite at the end of the club room floor .<ssssss>finally , thereâs no wireless connection and the connection be fairly slow by my standards.hope this help .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 4 3 3 -1		great location , price , security , amenity .<ssssss>perfect location , the place look to have be recently remodel .<ssssss>the staff be friendly , security quite ample -lrb- cctv and keycard elevator -rrb- .<ssssss>all room include fridge -lrb- with bottled water -rrb- , microwave -lrb- with popcorn -rrb- , coffeemaker -lrb- with coffee -rrb- , and tv .<ssssss>bed be okay , pillow could have be better .<ssssss>dick 's burger and safeway grocery directly across the street .<ssssss>several other restaurant and bar within 2-3 block .<ssssss>we pay $ 95 + tax for this room and it be so much better than the homewood suite on western ave.also 2 block from seattle center , spaceneedle , monorail , etc. .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 1 4 5 2		not worth the price .<ssssss>this hotel may have a great location but the room be extremely old and dirty .<ssssss>the staff be helpful , but this really do not help the situation .<ssssss>the moment you walk into the room you feel and smell the dust and dirt .<ssssss>you will not feel secure on the first floor .<ssssss>group be constantly gather directly outside of you window .<ssssss>if you must go to this hotel request a room on the second floor or higher .<ssssss>we shower be not drain and maintenance be extremely quick in come to fix the issue.i be assume that amenity alone make this hotel a 3?1/2 star because if cleanliness be take into account it would probably be around a 2 star.i would not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 2 5 5 5		nice location , need renovation the hotel be in a decent location close to the pier and north beach , and marina .<ssssss>the room be very average in my opinion .<ssssss>i be upgrade to a deluxe king room which be very large but not luxurious at all .<ssssss>the shower have mold on the tile and the carpet look about 20 year old .<ssssss>i have stay in hampton inn that look more update .<ssssss>the room do not even have flat screen tv in they which i thought be standard in hilton now .<ssssss>the pool area be pretty nice and the gym be good .<ssssss>the breakfast be also really good .<ssssss>the parking be under the hotel which be convient if you do not want valet .<ssssss>overall a decent hotel which could be turn into a very nice place with some more modern update to the room .<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 4 2 3 4		good location for sightseeing just get back from six night at this hotel .<ssssss>this be a sightseeing trip with my family ; i choose this hotel because i want something that be in a good location for tour around , and where we could sleep comfortably .<ssssss>i book the hotel a couple of month ago , on the hotel website .<ssssss>at that time i request the club level .<ssssss>i be willing to pay a bit extra for the convenience of the continental breakfast ; i could not find a rate that include breakfast otherwise .<ssssss>when i get to the hotel , i learn that the lounge would not be open for 3 of the 6 day we would be there .<ssssss>at my request , we be move to a non-club level room , at a lower rate .<ssssss>they do not reduce the rate for we last night , however .<ssssss>-lrb- the rate be go to go up because of the new year -rrb- .<ssssss>thankfully , however , the hotel be connect to the hollywood and highland mall , and we do not need to have breakfast in the hotel .<ssssss>my husband bring up coffee from the starbuck each morning , and we do not pay the outrageous price for the hotel breakfast buffet.there be no minibar , but we do not miss that .<ssssss>i do notice that there be no in-room safe .<ssssss>we do not use room service , and housekeeping be adequate .<ssssss>the hotel be in a great location for sightseeing - we go all over l.a. and have a great time .<ssssss>there be a on-site car rental -lrb- hertz -rrb- which be convenient .<ssssss>we park in the mall for $ 10 a night rather than pay the $ 29 for the hotel 's valet parking.the hotel be functional and serve its purpose as a base for sightseeing , and a place to sleep and shower .<ssssss>it be in no way luxurious , but it meet we need .<ssssss>i would recommend it to a friend who be go on a similar kind of trip .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 2 4 2 1		not so impressed with the sheraton !!<ssssss>i stay at the sheraton waikiki and i find the hotel to be fair but not special .<ssssss>i like the nightly singers/performers that would appear pool side .<ssssss>my main disappointment be that my room be smelly and the cleaning be below par .<ssssss>the hotel room turnover be obviously high so cleanliness should be a priority .<ssssss>the hotel be not cheap so i would have expect higher standard normally i would order room service for breakfast but i be put off on this occasion !<ssssss>i love oahu so i will go back but i will try to find something that be maybe not so tourist central !<ssssss>
4 -1 4 4 5 2 5 -1		beautiful resort but a few minor problem just return from a two week stay at the bahia principe and think i would write a review give a honest british point of view -lrb- as not many review from we brit ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i have be read all the review for month before the holiday and be pretty confident that it would be okay - and it was.arrived at punta cana airport and think it be a very nice look airport with the thatched roof .<ssssss>get through very quickly and if you really want to carry you own bag through then believe I you have to be very firm with the man wait there .<ssssss>they block the way through and we do find it a bit intimidating .<ssssss>it probably would be easier to just part with you dollar and let they carry they for you but it depend on you principles!hotel check in be do on the bus on the way to the resort and this be a excellent idea and save you from que at the reception on arrival .<ssssss>just be sure to wait at the entrance of the hotel for a bellboy to transport you and you luggage to you room !<ssssss>-lrb- otherwise you will be wander around like we until we decide to go back to the front of the hotel . -rrb-<ssssss>basically all previous review be very accurate when they decribe the resort as large and very beaufiful , that be spot on .<ssssss>we go to south of the island a few year ago to a 3 * hotel and the principe win hand down for beauty .<ssssss>the size of the hotel be never a problem with the use of the shuttle bus if you really do not want to walk.with regard to the food i must admit we be a bit dissapointed with the buffet , we go to a riu palace in mexico a couple of year ago and that buffet be much better .<ssssss>have say that you certainly will not go hungry and i must say it do sort of grow on you as the time pass and you begin to find different thing to try .<ssssss>i think it depend on what you have experience in the past .<ssssss>most of the a la cartes be very good , the garden grill and the japenese be we favourites.service at the hotel be excellent and neally all the staff be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>language barrier be occasionally a problem but you will get by !<ssssss>-lrb- vino blanco , vino tinto -lrb- white and red wine -rrb- and do cerveza -lrb- 2 beer -rrb- be we most important request in spanish during the holiday !!!!! -rrb-<ssssss>we main gripe be the fact that you have to get up at the crack of dawn to get sunbed with a shade -lrb- which obviously you do not really want to do on you holiday -rrb- and the fact that the ppol and beach be quite noisy sometimes .<ssssss>-lrb- a lot of the noise be be make by the hundered of canadian that holiday there , they seem to be unable to speak in normal voice level ! -rrb-<ssssss>so there you have it , we thoroughly enjoy we holiday despite the few complaint and would return there maybe someday .<ssssss>
3 3 3 3 3 1 1 -1		not bad the food be good not great but good .<ssssss>the room be clean everyday very late .<ssssss>i be talk about 5:00 and later<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 2 -1 3 -1		what a bad experience dirty room , very noisy we be unable to sleep due to traffic and noise from the other room also door bang allnight .<ssssss>breakfast be not worth the money , just a bit of cereal nothing else .<ssssss>bathroom be very small .<ssssss>you could not sit out on the balcony due to the traffic noise and polution .<ssssss>if i be you i would not stay at this hotel .<ssssss>it be also along way from the centre of sydney .<ssssss>
4 4 2 4 3 5 5 3		5 star service , room need to be update incredible service , better than in some of the 5 star hotel we stay in during we honeymoon in indonesia .<ssssss>we stay in the wooden room and find it quite dark and the bathroom definetely need a update .<ssssss>the basin be crack and we could not use the big bath ; we try to use it twice and the hot water run out .<ssssss>maybe we be unlucky with the room ?<ssssss>i do not know .<ssssss>the view from the terrace be amazing though .<ssssss>i would go back , but i would book one of the newer room .<ssssss>overall , a nice experience , top notch service .<ssssss>

2 2 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		expensive for what it be but great location graet loaction right round the corner from circular quay where you catch ferry to all the main attraction , wlake distance from the shop , opera house , botanical garden , observatory and the rocks.staff completely unhelpful - try to establish what be open over easter weekend be a nightmare and they give incorrect information .<ssssss>view be good from some room but do not be fool that you will necessarily see the op house or bridge unless they explicitly say so in you booking form - make sure you have it in writing.breakfast buffet be expensive a $ 25 , but have everything you could want - fruit , hot food , pancake , cereal , baked goods .<ssssss>very comfortable bed and large bathroom .<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 4 3 4 4		mixed feeling about hotel i stay in the hotel on 21 june 2008 .<ssssss>i be a bit disappointed because i originally book -lrb- through the marriott website -rrb- a non-smoking king bed room .<ssssss>we check in very early on 21 june and we room be not ready , so we come back late in the peace.when we come back to the hotel , we be give a double bed smoking room .<ssssss>i be extremely disappoint with this , as i specifically ask that my preference would be a non-smoking room double bed , but i get smoking.i have previously stay at the marriott in victoria , canada in 2007 and be very impressed with the facility and location .<ssssss>unfortunately , with these expectation in mind , i be expect that the sydney harbourside marriott would be the same - unfortunately , it be not as good .<ssssss>i do have to say that the marriott in victoria be recently renovate in the last year , but the harbourside marriott have not be and i see this in the room.for those who be think of stay in a opera house room -lrb- i stay in one of these room on the 19th floor -rrb- , it be not quite what you think .<ssssss>you can see the opera house , but the view be see through in between 2 building to the left and right of the window - you do not have a 180 degree view which look directly onto the opera house -lrb- if that make any sense -rrb- .<ssssss>also , you room face east , so when you go and open the blind in the morning , the sun come directly into you room/face and blind you .<ssssss>i do not recall see in the room a usb port -lrb- which i see at the victoria marriott -rrb- which would have be handy to charge a ipod -lrb- for example -rrb- .<ssssss>the reason why i be post this post be because of something that happen on the evening of 21 june , which i be a bit concerned about .<ssssss>i go down to the health club on saturday evening around 7pm .<ssssss>firstly , the spa be empty and do not have any water in it -lrb- be cover up -rrb- .<ssssss>so if you have expectation of have a spa in the winter at this marriott , forget it!secondly , for those who have child and be think about use the pool , the pool do not have a shallow depth for you to stand on -lrb- i be plan to do some aqua exercise and could not , because i be short and could not touch the bottom of the swimming pool without my head be submerge ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the pool be 1.4 metre deep all the way around .<ssssss>nice pool , despite this.finally , the biggest concern for I be that i be there for 40 minute and the health club in that time be not man .<ssssss>i be appal because of the swimming pool and the danger of child drown - too bad , no one be there to save you if you drown .<ssssss>also , there be locker , but at the time i be there , there be no key for the locker , so you could use they .<ssssss>i go to the desk and because it be not man , i could not get help , the sauna be very nice , i must admit -lrb- though it be not steam when i be there - it be nice and hot ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>with the bvlgari pack you get , you only get one soap bar , bath salt and something else for one person -lrb- not for 2 people -rrb- .<ssssss>we also do not have bathrobe in we room , so that be a bit sad.finally , the buffet breakfast be good -lrb- on the whole -rrb- .<ssssss>the fruit be very sweet and nice -lrb- give the fact that it be winter in sydney -rrb- .<ssssss>do not go at 10am - we have to queue for 10 minute before get a table!i forget to mention - the location be excellent - 2 minute walk from the airport train and circular quay .<ssssss>love the location of the hotel .<ssssss>you pay for the location though .<ssssss>walk distance to many thing .<ssssss>
2 1 1 4 2 3 1 1		faulty tower seattle look , you really could do better than this hotel .<ssssss>after the fire alarm -lrb- one at 07:30 on christmas day -rrb- , the hot water failure -lrb- almost all day -rrb- , the internet failure -lrb- again , most of the day -rrb- , the broken clothes drier , the kitchen that fall apart when we touch it , the front desk say yes but mean no we give up and move to another hotel .<ssssss>and save $ 30/night for a bigger better room !<ssssss>in a better part of town !<ssssss>long story short , they be undergo a renovation that be be do poorly -lrb- we stay in a renovate room -rrb- .<ssssss>the design of the hotel be poor : window that can not open and windowless , dark living room for the one bedroom suite .<ssssss>we kitchen be never equip with pot and pan although we make repeat request .<ssssss>we hide a bed comforter never come although we ask for one several time .<ssssss>unless you have a lot of time to deal with a endless list of challenge and you do not mind pay absolute top dollar for this kind of hotel , do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.on the plus side , the breakfast could not have be nicer and the evening reception -lrb- with meal , basically -rrb- look nice as well .<ssssss>the front desk do they best to help we most of the time and they do take money off of we bill when we ask they to do so after all of the equipment failure , etc. it be not as if the staff be not try , it be just too little too late .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 2 3 3 -1		not such a great stay .<ssssss>the herbert as everyone say be hard to find .<ssssss>once you do , you realize you be in a great location , close to great shopping and action right outside you door .<ssssss>for that reason you also need to bring earplug to sleep as it be very noisy all night long .<ssssss>my wife and i do not sleep well at all during we stay there .<ssssss>the price be great for a downtown location , but the place be not very clean .<ssssss>the rug in the room we have need to be wash as we sock be black in no time .<ssssss>no ice machine or air conditioning can be a bit of a downfall if you need either .<ssssss>cute room and decor and a great location could not cover up the other shortfall the hotel have .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 4 2 2 4		nothing great , nothing bad i stay at this hotel for 3 day at the end of sep ' 06 .<ssssss>i do not want to write a review as this be the beginning of my vacation and i want to see what the other hotel be like in italy -lrb- 1st time in italy -rrb- before i give it a review .<ssssss>we will i be at the end of my trip and i think the hotel be just average .<ssssss>this hotel be book for I by gate1 so i do not really have a choice but the room i get be pretty average .<ssssss>i be not sure what i end up pay since it be book through the travel agency but it be really just average .<ssssss>there be absolutely nothing special about this place .<ssssss>the guy at the front desk be kinda rude and not very friendly , the room be small -lrb- even compare to other italy hotel -rrb- but on a positive note , it be close to everything , and it be fairly clean .<ssssss>breakfast be a little better than the average breakfast i have have in italy .<ssssss>if you can not find a great hotel in florence , this one be not bad .<ssssss>

2 college-aged kid , my in-law , my brother and sister-in-law , and they 7 year old .<ssssss>we fly continental out of newark and both the depart flight and we return flight be smooth and problem free.following the instruction we be give on this site , we ignore the man in the punta cana airport who be shout âApple vacation , we will take you luggageâ ?<ssssss>although we be book with apple , we take we own luggage the 50 foot further where we be greet by the true apple representative who take we to the bus .<ssssss>the bus take about 45 minute to get to the palladium , stop at 2 other hotels.check in be fast and gracious .<ssssss>jesus be friendly and helpful and give we gift because one of we room be not ready .<ssssss>the room be locate in the 2000 block , honor we travel agentâs request .<ssssss>some face the pool and some be on the side where we even have a little glimpse of the ocean .<ssssss>i think the room be lovely .<ssssss>decent size and clean .<ssssss>the bed be very comfortable .<ssssss>the jacuzzi be in the bathroom and nice to have .<ssssss>the shower be a bit unusual and the taller people in we group have some difficulty get the water to stay inside the tub area.the beach be beautiful , as be the garden .<ssssss>the garden in the bavaro side be more in bloom , but all be meticulously care for .<ssssss>the pool be nice and clean â?a little cold but most of we group enjoy the water .<ssssss>the ocean be warmer than the pool .<ssssss>the bar be great , as be the bartender who be very efficient and friendly .<ssssss>unfortunately , the staff in the restaurant be not as pleasant as the bar staff .<ssssss>the service in the restaurant be very poor .<ssssss>in a recently post ta review , it say that the vast majority of the staff we encounter seem less than enthused to be work at the resort .<ssssss>we find the same experience .<ssssss>there be no smile .<ssssss>they seem put out if we request coffee or water .<ssssss>service be slow -lrb- or sometimes nonexistent as iâll explain later -rrb- .<ssssss>we eat breakfast at the buffet at the palace -lrb- las torre -rrb- , punta cana -lrb- el behique -rrb- , and bavaro -lrb- le catedral -rrb- .<ssssss>we eat dinner at the buffet twice and at two a la carte .<ssssss>several complaint about the buffet .<ssssss>they be not lay out well .<ssssss>many of the breakfast food be make to order create line that take about 15 minute each .<ssssss>thatâs 15 minute for egg , then 15 minute for waffle , etc. le catedral be the best where there be some item make to order , but also a tray of pre-prepared egg and pancake , and french toast .<ssssss>too bad we didnât discover this buffet until we last breakfast .<ssssss>the quality of the food itself be good , not great .<ssssss>the selection be very good.another complaint : i wonder how the no-reservation system would work for a la carte .<ssssss>not well !<ssssss>we arrive the second night at bamboo -lrb- the asian restaurant -rrb- at 7:30 .<ssssss>no room and a hour wait .<ssssss>a couple have be wait 45 minute when we arrive and be get impatient .<ssssss>if the group of 2 be have trouble , it do not look good for we group of 9 !<ssssss>we then try the mexican restaurant and the spanish restaurant .<ssssss>no luck .<ssssss>so we go to the buffet .<ssssss>the follow night we arrive at bamboo at 6:00 -lrb- it open at 6:30 -rrb- and we do get in .<ssssss>food and service at that restaurant be very good.our biggest problem : we last night we go to el arricife -lrb- seafood steak -rrb- .<ssssss>know to get there early , we arrive at 6:00 and enjoy talk to the other already line up .<ssssss>we be seat at 6:30 .<ssssss>one thing i do not like about the palladium be that they do not cater to group .<ssssss>even in the buffet there be only table for 4 -lrb- 6 at the most -rrb- .<ssssss>they get very upset if you request that two or three table be push together .<ssssss>el arricife be we last dinner and we want to eat together .<ssssss>they actually grant this even though they seem annoy by it .<ssssss>the beverage server come promptly -lrb- and be very good all night -rrb- .<ssssss>the waiter take we order and we wait for we food .<ssssss>we wait 2 hour !<ssssss>i donât know what happen .<ssssss>itâs not that they forget about we â?they bring the 7 year old she food know she would be hungry .<ssssss>when we finally ask the maitre dâ?for assistance , the waiter have to retake we order and then we wait for more time .<ssssss>we eat the appetizer but be too upset to enjoy the main meal .<ssssss>it be now about 9:00 pm .<ssssss>we eat in 10 minute and skip dessert .<ssssss>the most aggrevating part be that the staff do not seem to care .<ssssss>-lrb- for what itâs worth , the food that we do get be good -rrb- .<ssssss>just so you know â?we start off we stay at the hotel by tip , but find the service so lack that we only tip occasionally when it be appropriate.one other complaint -lrb- then iâll get back to the good -rrb- : the resort be very large , as i know it would be .<ssssss>after the first day i have no problem find my way around and enjoy walk between the different section of the hotel .<ssssss>however , we second day have very , very hard rain .<ssssss>between the rain and my father-in-lawâs bad leg , we need to take the train .<ssssss>we wait for over a hour for a train with space .<ssssss>there be a line to get on the train but when it arrive , everyone just shove each other and run to it .<ssssss>it should be more organized.there be a silver line to the train episode .<ssssss>while wait in line for the train , i say something to the family behind I .<ssssss>then the woman ask I where i be from and i ask they the same .<ssssss>when she respond , i realize that she be razel from trip advisor !<ssssss>the hotel be huge .<ssssss>it be such a coincidence to meet .<ssssss>i enjoy meet she and she family who seem like lovely people!more good : the activity â?we have fun with jonathon and all the activity staff do beach aerobic , swim competition , balloon game , etc. they do a good job.they also have nice recreation activity which we do on we own -lrb- in the rain -rrb- .<ssssss>mini-golf , badminton , life-size chess , soccer field , and more .<ssssss>we go to 2 show at night .<ssssss>a âMr .<ssssss>palladiumâ?competition and the karaoke night .<ssssss>not really my kind of show .<ssssss>i hear the michael jackson show and the star -lrb- impersonator -rrb- show be good but we couldnât fit they in.i want to give my honest opinion of the resort because i choose it base on what i read here .<ssssss>however , we have be to other all-inclusive -lrb- sandal , breeze , iberostar bavaro , and palladium mayan riviera -rrb- and find that better service and attitude can be find at all the other .<ssssss>i feel bad complain about certain thing at the hotel when it be obviously a very nice hotel and i feel fortunate to be able to take this kind of vacation .<ssssss>overall we have a nice vacation in a tropical location with we extend family .<ssssss>i hope i be lucky enough to be able to take a trip like this again but i will choose a different hotel .<ssssss>
4 2 5 4 5 5 5 5		pan pacific - great for business ... my experince of this hotel be that while it be very nice , it be very much business orientate with price to reflect someone else foot the bill .<ssssss>we be on we honeymoon and receive a room upgrade to a panoramic view overlook part of the city .<ssssss>the room have all the ammenity you would expect from a 5 star hotel , and some i would never see before - such as a slide panel allow you to connect a laptop/usb etc to the large lcd tv - along with a comprehensive set of video/audio lead to hook up you mp3 player to the in room speaker/tv system - a nice touch , but again show the empasis towards business user .<ssssss>another nice gadget be the remote controlled blinds/curtains .<ssssss>the 28th floor where we room be be reach by external capsule lift .<ssssss>i do not suffer from vertigo but feel myself hang on a few time !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>the hotel be part of a shopping/hotel complex .<ssssss>i feel the shop be all more expensive than home -lrb- uk -rrb- and be very much gear to the japanese shopper .<ssssss>this whole complex be expensive proably due to its trendy shop , boutique and eat place - there be much cheaper place to eat and drink ... i feel the food and drink at the hotel be outrageously price - especially for holiday maker - again , if a business be pay its not such a problem - a point i make on my customer satisfaction form .<ssssss>i be inform they be competitive with other hotel in the area - but as i later find not competitive with hotel in less trendy area .<ssssss>as a result , the bar and restaurant be never full and only sparsley fill with busniess people on phone laptop and as such do not have a very socialble or relaxing atmosphere .<ssssss>by go to boat or clarke quay - about 10 min cheap taxi - there be plenty or bar restaurant offer large discount and freebie to get you into they establishment - all have a great atmosphere and be very reasonable consider the expensive drink in singapore .<ssssss>when i ask the concierge if there be any good place to eat - he do not know or do not want to tell - as he be not very helpful .<ssssss>overall , nice hotel , but would not rush back but ideal for business user .<ssssss>facility too expensive for holiday if you be on a budget .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 3 3 3 2		good quality but too big the room and facility be fine and actually quite spacious , but the problem be the size of the hotel -lrb- c. 18 -20 floor and 20-30 room per floor at least -rrb- which just make you feel like a cog that pass through without touch the side .<ssssss>bit of a mixed metaphor i know , but if you like 40-60 room boutique hotel you will know what i mean .<ssssss>all the staff be friendly and helpful , just never see the same one twice .<ssssss>good size gym and location also a plus .<ssssss>few issues1 .<ssssss>the water they leave at the side of you bed be not complimentary -lrb- there should be a label tell you this -rrb- , it be a eye watering c. $ 12 after tax be added2 .<ssssss>in room internet be like $ 15 plus and be not even free in the business centre - this in the homeland of microsoft3 .<ssssss>food tray seem to get leave outside of room for a long time.as i say nothing major wrong - just too big for my taste .<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		excellent stay the fairmont copley plaza definitely do not disappoint .<ssssss>the service at this hotel be phenomenal .<ssssss>the room , while a touch on the small side , be very comfortable .<ssssss>the food in the oak room for dinner be excellent and the breakfast be very good , yet quite expensive .<ssssss>on day 2 we go to the burger king across the square for breakfast .<ssssss>this hotel have a prime location , as you be a block from 2 different t stop for public transportation and within walk distance to boston common and fenway park .<ssssss>

2 2 2 3 2 5 4 3		not the best choice in downtown l.a. i really want to like this hotel , but can not say i could recommend it to anyone.first of all , i want to say the people that work there be great .<ssssss>the front desk person check I in really early and be about as nice as a person could get .<ssssss>the cleaning crew be always smile and say hi so i can not say anything but good thing about them.the problem with this hotel be three thing :1 .<ssssss>the hotel building be old .<ssssss>sure , it be beautiful at the lobby level -lrb- actually stunning -rrb- , but that age also make the room small .<ssssss>i be sure it may have be sufficient in the 1930 's , but it be not even remotely up to par for the 21st century .<ssssss>the bathroom fixture be old and they make a lot of noise .2 .<ssssss>the room decoration be really cheap .<ssssss>the desk look like something out of the sear outdoor furniture collection and the tv ... a 13 incher .<ssssss>c'mon , i can accept the limitation of a old hotel , but a 13 inch tv obviously build in the late 70 's or early 80s .<ssssss>i just could not believe my eye .<ssssss>motel 6 's have better tv 's than that .3 .<ssssss>the street noise , just awful .<ssssss>i have read the management note on other review regard this and i understand they point , but half of the room face the outside street .<ssssss>you could do better on the lower floor with better insulate windows.i have stay at older hotel all over the country on business .<ssssss>i have see how it could be do well .<ssssss>the roosevelt in hollywood , the adolphus in dallas , the michelangelo in nyc and the palace in san francisco do it right .<ssssss>the millenium need to upgrade to be up to the standard of other classic hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 1 4 1 3 3 -1		terrible hotel for the money the good : i love downtown la and there be much to do with staple center , good public transit -lrb- subway -rrb- to long beach , great restaurant , and dodger stadium be just a short drive away .<ssssss>i stay in la about every other month for work and always have a great time .<ssssss>do i mention i love staying in lo angele .<ssssss>the hotel lobby and bar be absolutely beautiful i could not wait to get to my roomthe bad : the room be not acceptable , i actually think seriously about go to a different hotel !<ssssss>luckily my wife be not with I because i doubt that she would have stay .<ssssss>the room have bed and linen that must be 20 year old .<ssssss>everything look tired and dirty .<ssssss>the tv be the same 13 inch tv i have in my kitchen 25 year ago .<ssssss>i ask a employee if he have ever eat at the sushi restaurant or if he have ever hear anything .<ssssss>he say he would not eat there as he note that if smell really fish at time and he have hear bad thing .<ssssss>i have stay at the competition ; bonaventure , marriott , wilshire grand and would gladly have stay at any of they , although i do not ecommend the wilshire .<ssssss>the bonventure be a good deal and kind of neat to hang out in and around , just remember none be modern mavel .<ssssss>

1 1 1 5 2 1 2 1		not a good holiday the hotel be horrible very few elevator and you have to change elevator to reach the 19,20 floor .<ssssss>the water in the hotel go out when we be there .<ssssss>the parking be expensive , good location but bad staff and the room be not in good shape .<ssssss>we have a phone but no cord and the jack be out of the wall .<ssssss>when we go to plug in the iron there be something shove in the socket .<ssssss>also one light bulb work out of the 2 lamp we have .<ssssss>my advice pay 30 more dollar and stay at the omnus royal .<ssssss>
2 1 1 4 3 3 2 1		not as good as we think dub as one of the finer hotel in san juan we be sadly disappointed .<ssssss>the room look like something out of a ikea catalog , with perspex chair and bold pastel color .<ssssss>the wall be so thin i could here the phone of the room two door down not to mention the brat in the room next door who scream for a week !<ssssss>the lobby be amazing and turn into one of san juan 's premier night spot over the weekend .<ssssss>restaurant be very good with a choice of three but beware they be pricey .<ssssss>also love the casino , although small they have plenty of machine and quite a few table but sometimes only half the table be open and the dealer have no personality at all.outside the pool area be nice but the beach be a disappointment .<ssssss>number one , you need to hunt down a lounger as they do not put they all out and they do not clean the beach .<ssssss>its cover with cigarette butt , empty cup etc and little or no beach service.overall the el san juan be not as good as its market to be , try the ritz carlton instead .<ssssss>
4 2 2 5 5 3 -1 -1		boutique hotel , not great experience this review be long overdue and almost have forget to write it .<ssssss>the hotel be greatly located , with trendy reception and modern room .<ssssss>we be give a room on the top floor overlook the courtyard , so at least have some sun as the lower floor do not have any .<ssssss>although the price be quite high the room be small -lrb- less than 1 meter from the bed to the wall -rrb- and be wonder why we be give this room as the hotel seem to be emply .<ssssss>overflow shower , small bathroom , you get the picture .<ssssss>if the hotel be not so modern , would have get a worse review .<ssssss>staff be nice and polite and there be lot of amenity nearby .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 1 2 1 2		stay somewhere else unless you have to travel frequently by train the only good thing for this hotel be its location right on top of the train station .<ssssss>other than that , ` nothing special ' be already a very good comment to the hotel.this be the worst hotel in my two week trip in spain .<ssssss>bad smell inside we room and we bathtub be block by a use soap -lrb- it be a nightmare when i pick up the soap , leave by the previous guest , as i think it be the plug -rrb- !!!!<ssssss>the room be very date , and to be precise , the whole hotel be very dated.it be the barcelona biannual festival when we stay at the hotel .<ssssss>we ask the front desk for information on the festival and they answer be that they do not know anything about the festival .<ssssss>the internet corner be not free .<ssssss>people be allow to smoke in the lobby.although the room rate be not expensive , not cheap either .<ssssss>money could be better spend in other hotel .<ssssss>

either a comedy show which involve the audience or dance theme show .<ssssss>the main show start at 10 pm but at 9:30 thereâs always a comedic audience participation show involve audience member , we include , make fool of themselves -lrb- but which they donât advertise anywhere -rrb- .<ssssss>they be always funny .<ssssss>every thursday they have karaoke in the disco .<ssssss>again , this be not advertise anywhere .<ssssss>we only find out because one of the animation team be at the ocean bar with a sign up card .<ssssss>we meet several people who miss it and who be very disappointed because they be unaware of its existence ?<ssssss>also all the spa service be Â½ price during we stay which again werenât advertise anywhere ?<ssssss>finally , most of the animation staff have a very poor command of english , even though approximately at least half of the guest during we stay be either canadian or british , as evidence during poll conduct by the host while at the show .<ssssss>however , the front desk staff could communicate adequately in english .<ssssss>shoppingthe price at the onsite store be generally outrageous except for rum and cigar -lrb- you can negotiate the cigar price â?but they be still very high -rrb- .<ssssss>for example a tin of pringle convert to $ 8 u.s. by the way all price in the store be in euro .<ssssss>there be a convenience store in the vendor village about a 10 minute walk from the resort which be more reasonable for basic item such as snack , hair care product , suntan lotion , coffee , etc. the vendor in the vendor village be , of course , extremely aggressive and annoying .<ssssss>moreover , although they assert they will negotiate price they be pretty hard nose .<ssssss>we meet a american couple who have be to punta cana last year and they assert price have at least double .<ssssss>for example , last year they purchase a carton of u.s. cigarette for $ 7 .<ssssss>this year the best price they find be $ 16 â?which be also the experience of someone we chum with from we resort .<ssssss>foodgood selection and tasty in the main buffet but certainly not standard north american fare â?not a criticism just a observation .<ssssss>again lot of inconsistency â?for example we have to forage for a basic coffee cup many day .<ssssss>in the snack bar we be force to use plastic cold beverage cup for we coffee as not even styrofoam cup never mind ceramic coffee cup be available ?<ssssss>bizarre .<ssssss>the a la carte restaurant be unspectacular .<ssssss>again more inconsistency â?one night in the italian restaurant i be offer a sambuca after supper which they want to charge I $ 2 u.s. for .<ssssss>however at the pool bar i get the exact same sambuca for no charge ?<ssssss>in the brazilian restaurant thereâs a buffet which doesnât feature any meat .<ssssss>after a considerable period of time waiter come by with skewer of meat .<ssssss>i observe many people who load up they plate from this salad bar without any apparent cognition that meat be to follow .<ssssss>why wouldnât they explain what you should expect ?<ssssss>also we rep tell we the buffet by the pool -lrb- which double as the brazilian restaurant in the evening -rrb- be only for caribbean spa customer yet everyone use it ?<ssssss>at the snack bar they put some pretty unusual item on some of the pizza such as corn and chick pea ?<ssssss>the house wine be almost undrinkable.excursionswe go on the atv tour which be a lot of fun give weâve never drive a atv .<ssssss>great scenery and insight into what life be like at a typical dominican village .<ssssss>also go on the 3 hour âsunset tripâ?snorkeling tour which be ok except the sale person tell we there would be 2-2 .5 hour of snorkeling and it be actually only 40 minute .<ssssss>we book this through the pelicanos water sport hut on the beach at the hotel .<ssssss>conclusionthis resort have so much potential but it appear it be poorly manage and lack any effort to market all its offering to its guest .<ssssss>give that the price be comparable to similar resort and it be own by a establish , professional spanish firm that own several other resort , we donât buy the claim of several reviewer that âitâs the dominican and this be what you should expect.â?all we expect be a basic level of service that didnât exist .<ssssss>conversely , this basic level of service do exist at riu mambo in puerto plata which we visit last year -lrb- another 4 star resort -rrb- .<ssssss>
3 4 3 -1 2 -1 4 -1		love it or hate it i agree with one reviewer that it be hard to rate this hotel .<ssssss>you will either love it or hate it -- there be good and bad point to this hotel .<ssssss>my husband and i stay overnight on we way to the big island .<ssssss>we arrive in town early and ask if we could get a early check-in .<ssssss>they be very accommodate .<ssssss>and they give we a automatic room upgrade -lrb- we get a partial ocean-view room with a kitchenette for $ 123/night -rrb- .<ssssss>the staff be friendly .<ssssss>upon arrival at the hotel , we make note that all the hotel in the area be show they age .<ssssss>still , the aqua still seem to try to make a unique impression .<ssssss>the location be great -- a couple of block from the beach , a few block from the tourist center where the shop and restaurant be , near a abc store -lrb- it sell everything from food to clothes and sundry -rrb- and next to a major bus stop .<ssssss>since the aqua be small , it seem to be more quiet than other hotel we have stay at , which we appreciate .<ssssss>the aqua do a decent job on they recent remodel -- a lot of the area hotel have not bother -- and it look like they be still do some work .<ssssss>but we do notice that the hotel still smell like fresh paint .<ssssss>we room be fine .<ssssss>it be roomy , have two queen bed that look small , a nice sit area with a sofa , and a tiny kitchenette .<ssssss>the asian-inspired decor be nice .<ssssss>the bathroom be a decent size but date .<ssssss>there be a small shower stall and a separate tub .<ssssss>too bad they do not focus on remove the bathroom tile during the remodel .<ssssss>the shower tile and floor tile be clean , but look grimy from long use .<ssssss>the kitchenette look like it have be neglect in the renovate -- the table and chair look like it be from the salvation army , the counter look unfinished .<ssssss>we have lot of window and a lanai that offer a partial ocean-view , which be actually nice .<ssssss>the hotel do have a small but nice pool and a spa building , but we do not use them.this hotel be a step above a budget hotel , but it be not what i call a treat , because of some of the age and grunge factor .<ssssss>and from the other review , it sound like the quality vary from room to room .<ssssss>for the area and the price , we like this hotel for a fairly comfortable place to stay a few night while you be explore the island .<ssssss>but if you want to treat yourself , pay the extra money for a nicer hotel along the beach .<ssssss>
5 4 5 4 4 5 5 1		a perfect stay my boyfried and i stay here this past weekend for a long weekend away from the cold of nyc .<ssssss>we have a fabulous stay .<ssssss>the room be quite spacious give the price of the room and the service be excellent .<ssssss>the morning concierge -lrb- andrea -rrb- be wonderful and plan a trip that be amazing for we .<ssssss>i would stay away from the evening concierge -lrb- kyle ?<ssssss>i think -rrb- b/c he really do not listen to what we be look for but andrea rock !<ssssss>the only thing i find unnerve be the fact that there be mirror everywhere in the bathroom - you could watch yourself shower , take a bath , brushing one 's tooth and other unmentionable act .<ssssss>lose a few mirror would be helpful .<ssssss>but that be a minor issue .<ssssss>i be extremely picky and be pleasantly surprise at this place - especially after read a comment below that say it look date to wear .<ssssss>if you want something modern and new then go spend the money at the st. regi or hotel palomar .<ssssss>you definitely get what you pay for here : a comfortable bed , great service , and a positive stay .<ssssss>

4 5 3 5 3 5 4 -1		excellent value we have a wonderful vacation ; this be not a five star hotel but for the price it be definately worth it .<ssssss>i have stay at much nicer resort for more money and for traveler on a budget the caribe club be well worth the money .<ssssss>do not listen to all of the complaint , we have a great time .<ssssss>check-in - perfect and fast .<ssssss>we have three room next to each other .<ssssss>the hotel staff immediately bring we beer while we fill out paperwork and such .<ssssss>we change into we bathing suit and enjoy the gorgeouo beach until we room be ready .<ssssss>room - clean and comfortable ; yes the pillow be lumpy but whatever we be so tired every night it do not matter !<ssssss>fridge stock daily - if you want beer in you fridge just ask the maid they be very helpful -lrb- you need to speak spanish to they though -rrb- .<ssssss>beach and pool - beach be awesome and the staff very fun ; many game all day long very entertaining .<ssssss>pool bar get crowd , a few dollar help :-rrb- the partially shaded pool on the tropical princess side nice and quiet if you need a break , although the bar that be there have the only actual frozen pina colada -lrb- the beach bar and pool bar can not seem to keep up with they frozen drink , they be always watery -rrb- .<ssssss>the shaded spot on the beach be usually all go by about 8:30 or 9:00 - so if you want one go out earlier.food - we get tire of it , but that be normal for any all-inclusive .<ssssss>it be average , definately make reservation at a restaurant each night .<ssssss>the buffett be nice for lunch since they have fresh salad .<ssssss>my favorite lunch be the creperie - it open at 1:30 but be well worth it .<ssssss>mushroom and cheese crepe - they use fresh shitakke yummm .<ssssss>we pay for the seafood restaurant not worth it .<ssssss>lobster way overcooked and drown in butter .<ssssss>domincan restaurant be very good ; italian okay -lrb- do not get lasagna so salty -rrb- although the antipasta bar at the begin awesome .<ssssss>overall it be fine ; fresh fruit always available and absolutely wonderful .<ssssss>we do not go on vacation to eat so we really do not care .<ssssss>staff and other guest - staff very helpful and friendly .<ssssss>guest from all over the world , we meet so many nice people that we party with all week and will keep in contact with in the future .<ssssss>i would not recommend this resort for singles ; it be a great place to meet people and relax.check-out - well this be the only bad part of the whole trip ; but hurricane dean delay we flight and there be some miscommunication with we apple rep but we get out just in time !<ssssss>the direct flight on usa3000 be awesome .<ssssss>would definately go back to dr - although i would try a different resort just because i like change .<ssssss>
1 1 4 3 4 2 2 3		look be not everything and that be all this place have my husband and i , along with another couple , stay at the paradisus for 4 night from 2/28 -3 / 4 .<ssssss>everything other reviewer have say about this hotel 's appearance be accurate .<ssssss>the grounds be immaculate , the decor be beautiful , the restaurant be decorate well , the pool be amazing , the beach be great ... clearly they have put a lot of money and effort into get this part of the property right .<ssssss>however there be some major , major issue with this place that i think other have touch but i feel really need to be elaborate on .<ssssss>particularly at this price level , these thing be just unacceptable i think .<ssssss># 1 : the system they have in place for dinner reservation be absolutely absurd .<ssssss>there be 4 beautiful restaurant at the resort , all of which require reservation to eat at .<ssssss>that would not be so bad except you can only make reservation for that day from 9 be - 2 pm and for the next day from 6 pm - 9 pm .<ssssss>if you be arrive at the resort after 2 pm on the day you check-in -lrb- as we and many other be -rrb- you be out of luck for a dinner reservation on you first night .<ssssss>they will direct you to they dinner buffet which be little more then a taco bar but you can not eat the restaurant , end of story .<ssssss>we walk to the buffet take we by all the restaurant where we see at least 4 table open at each but they will not make any exception , even when we explain we do not have the opportunity to make the reservation for that night because we would only arrive at 5 pm and that they clearly have room for a party of 4 at one of they open table .<ssssss>this would be annoying anywhere but it be particularly infuriating when you be at a all inclusive resort and have already pay for dinner but they silly system will not allow you to eat where you want !<ssssss>at 6 pm -lrb- the first available time to make reservation for the next night -rrb- , we think we would figure out the system and get on the phone to make we reservation for we second night .<ssssss>somehow , even at 6 pm , the only time they have available for we be 9:45 !!!!<ssssss>when we challenge they on how and why this be possible , they just say that be all that be available ... no effort to help at all .<ssssss>you be explicity tell in you check-in material that you can only make reservation 1 day in advance but even then we could not eat until almost 10 pm ?!?!<ssssss>we eventually figure out that they be allow people to make reservation 2 and 3 day in advance -lrb- not what the information they provide when you check in say -rrb- so the first night we could get a reservation that be not 9:45 be we 3rd night at the resort .<ssssss>who want to deal with such hassle when they be suppose to be relax on vacation ?<ssssss># 2 : as you can see , they staff be not very helpful .<ssssss>they seem more hasseled then anything when you address they with a question .<ssssss>we even have a spanish speaker in we group and that do not help .<ssssss>with a few exception most really could not be bother with explain why or what something be or even just smile and say hello when you pass they in the hall .<ssssss>again , totally not on par with what i would expect for a hotel billing themselves as a lead hotel of the world .<ssssss># 3 : the food !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<ssssss>i simply do not understand how anyone can say this food be good , let alone great .<ssssss>we be absolutely perplexed by how horrendous the food be day after day at this resort , regardless of which restaurant or buffet we be eat at .<ssssss>what we originally write off as a fluke turn out to absolutelybe the norm there .<ssssss>food you would expect to be serve hot be warm at best , usually just plain cold .<ssssss>while there would be grill hot and ready to go , you could not get a burger cook to order .<ssssss>instead you have to take a pre-cooked burger , hot dog , etc from they chaeffer and use one of they stale bun .<ssssss>he cheese display sit in a refridgerate container with only 1 door -lrb- the other slide side be no where to be find -rrb- so it be warm and swarm with fly .<ssssss>chip on the nacho bar be stale , fries be cold and soggy , pizza be some disgusting frozen pizza ... i could literally go on and on and on .<ssssss>the food at they restaurant be not any better .<ssssss>we all comment that they appear to just take the gross food from they buffet and present it nicely on a plate .<ssssss>the french onion soup come out with a 2 square of yellow american cheese on top that be hard as a rock ... look like it have be microwave or something .<ssssss>in addition to just poor food quality , many of the dish be just tasteless and bland .<ssssss>we be all so disappointed in the food .<ssssss>none of we be picky eater and do not even have high expectation for the food ... this be not even school cafeteria quality .<ssssss>we all comment that a chili 's or tgi friday 's be 5 star compare to what they be serve .<ssssss>so in addition to make you wait until 10 pm , the food they give you be absolutely disgusting !<ssssss>you can understand why we be all look forward to go home and eat something decent -lrb- and by decent i mean chef boyardee would have be better then the pasta they be serve at this place -rrb- food .<ssssss>after pay this much for a place i would not expect any of these thing and would never recommend this resort to anyone .<ssssss>while it be beatiful and the drink be great , the overall experience be completely shatter by how hard it be to do something basic like eat dinner and then how disgust the food be .<ssssss>we be look forward to a relaxing vacation with friend , enjoy some great meal together .<ssssss>instead we spend much of we time discuss how gross everything be and how a place that be this beautiful could be overlook such a crictical piece of they guest ' experience .<ssssss>in short , if you be think about book at this place , do not .<ssssss>and if you already have , i suggest you pack lot of power bar or you will be subsist on box cereal from the breakfast buffet for you stay .<ssssss>

4 2 3 4 4 1 1 -1		ton of fun but terrible service first , the obvious : the el san juan be the place to be in puerto rico if you be look to have fun and be social .<ssssss>if you stay at the hotel , you get into the club -lrb- brava -rrb- for free -lrb- usually $ 30 -rrb- and it be like a bacardi commercial .<ssssss>i know that sound cheesy , but it be true .<ssssss>even if you do not want to be in the club , there be live music in the lobby , which be beautiful , and you can simply enjoy that for most of the night .<ssssss>great crowd , too .<ssssss>clearly , both local and tourist from other hotel know that this be the place to come.the pool be great .<ssssss>along with the rest of the hotel , it create a las vegas-esque atmosphere .<ssssss>if you like the palm , hard rock hotel , or to a lesser extend mandalay bay , you will love the el san juan .<ssssss>it have swim up bar , cabanas , and all of those type of thing .<ssssss>it be really fun to spend the day out there because you can bounce back and forth from the pool to the beach.what 's miss from this hotel be service .<ssssss>there be a few pleasant staff member , but for the most part the hotel treat I and those with I like they be do we a favor .<ssssss>in particular , the front desk , casino staff , and pool bar staff be not only rude , but move at a snail 's pace .<ssssss>i try not to take it personally because most of the service industry in san juan be not particularly friendly.fortunately , most other puerto rican be incredibly nice.in sum , this be really the best major hotel in the area .<ssssss>i have be to the ritz , marriott , e.a. , and they be hotel that could be anywhere .<ssssss>at least here you feel like you be in puerto rico and it make the poor service tolerable .<ssssss>

3 3 3 3 5 5 -1 4		mixed feeling about the casablanca i come to new york a few time a year for business and have stay at many hotel in midtown in the $ 200 - $ 250 price range .<ssssss>i decide to try the casablanca hotel because they be rate so highly on tripadvisor and they be have a special deal on rate during president 's week .<ssssss>there be certainly many thing to like about the casablanca : nice size room , very clean , large remodel bathroom , nice cafe/sitting area , and friendly service .<ssssss>yet i find several thing to be lack .<ssssss>for one , the bed be only marginally comfortable - you could feel the top of the spring .<ssssss>this be in contrast to the extraordinarily soft pillow .<ssssss>two , the cable reception on the television be so bad that most channel be unwatchable .<ssssss>three , i could hear some noise in my room and it prevent I from get to sleep until fairly late .<ssssss>while the outdoor noise from time square be quite muted , i could hear a lot from other guest on my floor - notably people slam they door which be quite jarring .<ssssss>lastly , the continental breakfast be only so-so .<ssssss>the coffee be no better than what you would get at a best western , and they serve cereal in the little child 's box - not exactly gourmet .<ssssss>i have basically a pleasant experience there , but i would have be disappoint if if i have pay $ 400 a night , which be supposedly the average rate .<ssssss>to my mind , this be a nice hotel for $ 250 - $ 300 , but a little lack if one pay more than that .<ssssss>
2 2 4 5 4 3 4 4		very overpiced my only reason to stay in this hotel be to attend a convention that be hold in the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel have good facility .<ssssss>but it be very overpriced and it try to charge fee for a lot of thing : in room internet access $ 14.95 / night , a small fridge in room $ 10/night .<ssssss>fitness club need a fee .<ssssss>swim pool be outdoor but free of charge.there be many many hotel within 0.5 mile distance from this hotel .<ssssss>other be better deal .<ssssss>try to avoid this one .<ssssss>
1 1 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		terrible , rude service this place be a joke .<ssssss>during we stay , my mother fall on the hotel step and break she leg , yet never once do anybody in the hotel inquire if she need help , a doctor , a ambulance , etc. , nor do anybody ask how she be or go out of he or she way to help .<ssssss>instead , we receive very rude treatment and be not give information about the hotel -lrb- the name of the manager , the name of the owner -rrb- when we ask .<ssssss>additionally , the main elevator be in and out of service , and when we ask what to do -lrb- mother on crutch -rrb- , the desk clerk say , you will have to take the step .<ssssss>when my mother remind she that she could not get up the step with crutch , the desk clerk just shrug .<ssssss>we have a miserable experience there .<ssssss>you would think that when a person fall on you step , you would go out of you way to take care of that person .<ssssss>i emphatically do not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>

1 1 4 5 5 1 4 3		total rip off - not as all-inclusive as you would think .<ssssss>service - the service be actually quite good the staff be always very friendly and helpful and i do think that they be overall quite attentive.reception - we arrive at 6:00 pm and there be one woman at the reception who be not terribly nice .<ssssss>there be only one family ahead of we but it take we 45 minute to get check in .<ssssss>food - atrocious .<ssssss>at $ 1240 a night per room , -lrb- and i would say that we room be worth at the very very most $ 300 a night -lrb- actually , i be be very generous -rrb- , which leave about $ 940 for the rest of the amenity per day , $ 470 per person , the food should be beyond amazing .<ssssss>however , most of the restaurant offer buffet-style appetizer dining and in my book , no classy restaurant make you run around and serve yourself .<ssssss>in addition to which the different cuisine that they offer -lrb- french , italian , carribean , etc -rrb- offer largely the same array of dish for the appetizer , which be very disappointing .<ssssss>the presentation and quality of the food also very disappointing .<ssssss>a japanese restaurant with no chopstick , for example , be just weird .<ssssss>the all-day dining room service menu stink too .<ssssss>they offer sandwich , blt 's , hamburger , for the most part .<ssssss>the fanciest offering be a shrimp ceviche and beef carpaccio , but they be mediocre at best .<ssssss>and you be restricted to 2 beer per room per night .<ssssss>what the hell be that?spa - they tell you it be include , and that the massage/facial treatment be not include , but in fact the use of the spa be only include if you have a facial/massage appointment that day .<ssssss>those treament cost between $ 80 - $ 165 and the spa itself -lrb- we have a look -rrb- be pretty meager .<ssssss>the spa in my gym at home be set up better than what they have there .<ssssss>in order to even use the spa by itself , you have to pay $ 28 , which make it in fact not inclusive at all as part of the package .<ssssss>we be so annoyed by this that we cancel we appointment at the spa since we just have a feeling that it would not be a very good experience in the end .<ssssss>beach - the nice part of the beach be that it be never overcrowded since it only serve those stay in this hotel .<ssssss>the problem be that it be completely rocky and you can not really walk on it without shoe on .<ssssss>there really be no sand to speak of , more like gravelly pebble , which smart quite a bit on the foot .<ssssss>not surfable for sure , at least not while i have be here.the hotel building - really beautiful , very photogenic , it really be a sprawling complex that be great and not over crowded and well-decorated .<ssssss>conclusion - i just think that this be the very problem with this hotel which be that it look good but taste like crap .<ssssss>the fact that the food be so mediocre be a really big problem because the least that they can do be offer excellent food and it be just too disappointing in the end and there be no excuse for it give how much money people have to spend here .<ssssss>and honestly , if you just want to relax and have a beautiful time and eat good food and not feel rip off , then do not go here .<ssssss>

1 1 1 4 3 1 1 1		grotty hotel we book the imperial hotel in hong kong online use elong.com which specialise in hotel in asia and be recommend by one of they staff so we be confident it would be a good quality hotel - especially as it cost $ 1200 hkd per night .<ssssss>how wrong we were!we realise something be wrong when we walk through the door in reception mid oct 2008 which be fill with suitcase across the floor and people everywhere .<ssssss>the room we be give in the imperial hotel be 1712 located on the top floor .<ssssss>the small lift do work , but we be surprise when the door open to view a narrow hallway carpet cover in a dust sheet and a laundry trolley in the way .<ssssss>we room be at the very end of a dimly light corridor.on open the door to the room the smell of damp hit home , along with the noise of a air-conditioning unit and a dehumidifier .<ssssss>the window be lock shut so there be no way to vent this foul smell .<ssssss>to add to injury there be a hole in the wall.the room itself be fairly small though the bed be of reasonable size and the bathroom be compact with a bath , shower and wc which be clean but certainly not worth $ 1200 hkd -lrb- $ 154 usd or Â£90 gbp -rrb- per night.we decide to go for a walk to discuss option before return , collect we bag and leave the imperial hotel .<ssssss>total time from check-in to check-out be approx two hour .<ssssss>in view of this we ask for we money back , but the manager refuse point-blank to return any money because we have book the hotel online .<ssssss>the fact the service receive and quality of room be sub-standard seem to have be missed.my recommendation to any visitor to hong kong .<ssssss>the imperial hotel in hong kong be one hotel that should be avoid at all cost - there be plenty other hotel in hong kong at a similar price range offering far better facilities.though i be force to sign ` under duress ' the credit card slip before leave the imperial hotel in hong kong , though i will now be contact my credit card company to demand a full refund.basil fawlty would have be proud of the totally crap service provide by the imperial hotel staff .<ssssss>the word ` imperial ' be somewhat misleading , well apart from they service charge.my recommendation - avoid the imperial hotel in hong kong at all cost !<ssssss>
4 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		relatively quiet b we stay there for 3 night .<ssssss>the place be family-run , with a courteous staff .<ssssss>we room be spacious with a nice king size bed .<ssssss>there be wooden floor , and it feel more like a dormitory than a hotel .<ssssss>the shower be mediocre.you can get breakfast or dinner prepare at the hotel , but a better deal for breakfast can be have only 2 or 3 block away -- there be a breakfast buffet at a nearby hotel that have a lot more option and better food for cheaper too !!!<ssssss>

2 -1 1 4 2 2 2 -1		queen kapiolanus - big disappointment for the last leg of we dream vacation we stay at the queen kapiolanus hotel from may 17-21 after a week on maui and a week on the pride of america inter-island cruise .<ssssss>we book it because of the location and price as the hotel offer a airline discount .<ssssss>the new owner , castle resort property , need to invest some major $ $ $ $ $ in renovate this property .<ssssss>we be in room 914 which have a wonderful view of diamond head ; however , the noise from the traffic keep I awake every night .<ssssss>also the room be near the elevator shaft so i hear the elevator go up and down all night .<ssssss>the pool be very clean and the restaurant have a nice breakfast menu .<ssssss>the location be great as you can walk to the beautiful beach , the zoo , the waikiki shell , international marketplace , etc. but i will never stay there again unless they renovate it , nor would i recommend it to anyone .<ssssss>for the last leg of we dream vacation and 25th wedding anniversary , i be anticipate much better accommodation than what we have .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 2 2 2 2		very sad - managemnt give up a long time ago i will not say that it be the worst hotel in waikiki .<ssssss>after all we do not have problem like cockroach in the room .<ssssss>i will not even complain that it be old .<ssssss>many hotel in waikikus be old - mean the structure themselves - but when properly maintain it do not necessarily matter .<ssssss>here be the deal with this hotel : it be not well-maintained and it be dirty and dreary and very neglect .<ssssss>i have no grudge against the place but nonetheless i have to say do not believe what you see on the web site .<ssssss>here be a good example of what i mean about management have give up .<ssssss>accord to the web site as of today : the cascada bar be currently under construction .<ssssss>please check back to find out when the renovation will be complete and the bar be open .<ssssss>it have say that for year .<ssssss>that be right - since three year ago at least -lrb- and the cascada bar remain untouched -rrb- .<ssssss>i have keep a eye on this hotel for quite some time .<ssssss>that example pretty much sum up the whole package .<ssssss>the royal garden function -lrb- and i suppose that the staff do its best with what be have -rrb- but it be obvious that no energy , time , or money go into improvement or even to live up to what it promise on the web site .<ssssss>honestly you can not help but think word like dreary and sad .<ssssss>it be not even the kind of place at which you feel comfortable to walk around without shoe in you own room .<ssssss>that would be fine if both the rate be lower and it do not make itself sound like a upscale hotel with great amenity on its web site .<ssssss>look at the photo of ` pool/sauna ' .<ssssss>the photograph do not make the pool area look very appealing but it be as if they do not even make a effort .<ssssss>see the van park behind the pool ?<ssssss>obviously they just do not care .<ssssss>the location be great and - like i say - for the right rate it would be okay but all thing consider it be absolutely not good value for money .<ssssss>some of the ohana hotel be far superior -lrb- and they do not pretend to be something that they be not -rrb- for the same money .<ssssss>i mention that only because i have read too many review on this site in which people say there be much better option and they always leave I think okay ... but what be those better option ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>the only way that the place will sit up and take notice of its many many shortcoming be if people stop waste they good money there .<ssssss>i hope that that happen because the hotel be really a disgrace -lrb- and what a shame consider the great location -rrb- .<ssssss>

4 3 4 5 5 4 5 3		great location , but some noise i have stay in a two-bed small room , and i have stay in a one bedroom king suite .<ssssss>both the little suite and the two-bed room have clean marble bath , but both bathroom be rather small .<ssssss>in addition , there be almost no bureau/armoire space to put clothes .<ssssss>one room have only two middle size drawer available and the other have only one , very narrow highboy.the hotel staff be uniformly helpful , although at least one of the woman at the front desk/concierge have a little trouble speak and understand english , and in addition she be not quite up to speed on information about the hotel and its policies.street noise be a problem , because my room be on the street side -lrb- mass ave or commonwealth ave -rrb- ; the solid âblackoutâ?curtains be great , but , particularly in the very early morning -lrb- e.g. , 5:00 be -rrb- , there be a lot of traffic noise and it wake I up every day.the room be service promptly and well by the cleaning staff.i eat only one breakfast in clio , the restaurant in the hotel ; the food be fine , but not particularly imaginative and on the quite expensive side .<ssssss>opt instead for the breakfast at the trident book store which be right up the street on newbury ave.as be typical of very high price hotel , there be a separate charge for everything , include the use of the internet in the room .<ssssss>the location be excellent â?you can walk to fenway park , there be a t stop in the next block , and there be lot of shopping and restaurant option within easy walk distance.bottom line - the staff be great , the location be excellent , bathroom be nice but small , traffic noise can wake you up or keep you awake , and the cost be high .<ssssss>if money be no object , and you can sleep through most thing , this be a perfect place for you .<ssssss>
3 5 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		it be what it be ... .<ssssss>that be -- the hotel metro be a moderately price hotel in midtown manhattan .<ssssss>if you set you expectaion somewhere around the holiday inn level , you will be perfectly satisfy with this hotel .<ssssss>however , if you be expect to find four or five-star luxury at this price range -lrb- at this or any other hotel -rrb- , prepare to be sorely disappoint .<ssssss>there be no question that this hotel have some nice feature and add touch .<ssssss>the lobby be certainly above average at this price point , as report by previous guest .<ssssss>the bagel , muffin and pastry serve each morning be fresh and plentiful , and the quality of the coffee be pleasantly surprising .<ssssss>the fitness facility be also better than expect -- most gym regular should be able to get a decent workout here with only a few compromise to they regular regimen .<ssssss>finally , the view from the rooftop patio may alone be worth the price of admission -- it be indeed breathtaking .<ssssss>the room be miniscule , without question .<ssssss>i have stay in quite a few nyc hotel and i have grow accustomed to the small room size , but this be small .<ssssss>i get the impression -lrb- base upon other review -rrb- that room size vary significantly within the standard size , so this may be something to discuss with the front desk at check-in .<ssssss>in my case , there be barely enough room between the bed and the door for the door to swing open , and the chair and table which nestle against the window on the opposite side of the room come right to the other edge of the bed .<ssssss>door , bed , table , window -- that be it .<ssssss>the aforementioned window , furthermore , take a fair bit of effort to open , and there be no screen .<ssssss>i would be surprise if the entire room be more than 50 or 60 square foot in size .<ssssss>all this notwithstanding , the room be reasonably well decorate , and do not feel at all shabby or poorly maintain .<ssssss>the bathroom , though tiny as well , be nicely appoint with marble throughout , and the standup shower have excellent water pressure .<ssssss>a final word with regard to the bed .<ssssss>this be my greatest source of disappointment with the hotel metro .<ssssss>the bed -lrb- advertise as a queen -rrb- be barely a double , and it be likely the least comfortable i have ever sleep in .<ssssss>the spring jut up throughout the mattress , and i wake up with a ache back each morning .<ssssss>the pillow be tiny as well -- they be more along the line of those minus airline pillow than those normally find on a bed .<ssssss>all in all , i would recommend this hotel to budget-minded traveller .<ssssss>in its price range , i be not certain one could do too much better in midtown manhattan .<ssssss>those in search of a bit more luxury , however , should look elsewhere .<ssssss>
2 3 5 -1 3 -1 5 -1		remarque .<ssssss>
2 2 4 5 4 3 4 -1		great location but noisy have stay at many w , and specifically this one before , we be look forward to we stay .<ssssss>at $ 500 per night , you definitely expect accommodation to be better than average .<ssssss>we drive from the airport and easily find the hotel garage .<ssssss>the hotel be in a stellar spot in the french quarter .<ssssss>we park -lrb- $ 32 per day which include a $ 3 surcharge for the suv avi give we -rrb- and check into we room .<ssssss>retrieve you car be quick .<ssssss>cab be pretty easy to catch too .<ssssss>we be give a room on the 2nd floor with a small balcony .<ssssss>we room overlook a vacant look building and seem like a nice quiet location .<ssssss>we other party get a room over the internal courtyard of the hotel .<ssssss>the courtyard be very comfortable with a small swimming pool and lounge chair .<ssssss>there be also a larger patio with many oversized chair to relax and have a drink if you so choose .<ssssss>after return from dinner i want to watch the alc -lrb- baseball -rrb- .<ssssss>the tv have little or no reception and i could not even access the service channel that be normally available.the bed be very comfortable as they be at all w/westins .<ssssss>the bathroom be very large and have a nice big shower with great water pressure .<ssssss>we soon learn that insulation and tightly seal window be not much of a consideration in the construction .<ssssss>the noise inside and outside the hotel be pretty loud .<ssssss>i recognize that no be a party town , but to hear the people in the street , courtyard , hallway like they be stand next to you be disconcert .<ssssss>we other party be keep awake most of the night .<ssssss>we be keep awake some of it .<ssssss>when we inquire about a quieter room , we be advise that these be two of the quieter room .<ssssss>to try and deal with the problem , we be tell that white noise generator be available .<ssssss>we request one and be tell it would arrive shortly .<ssssss>it take no less than 5 request and multiple visit to the front desk to get the machine .<ssssss>between denial that it exist and a lack of understand about how to get it , it be pretty frustrating .<ssssss>with the saint in town , we be concern that we would have another loud night .<ssssss>fortunately , rain slow down the reveler and it be much quieter .<ssssss>it be also a sunday night .<ssssss>all in all , we probably would not stay at this hotel again .<ssssss>the main reason be the amount of noise .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and accommodate -lrb- except for the misunderstand about the generator -rrb- and even allow we to store some frozen seafood in they freezer for 2 day .<ssssss>if you be there to party until all hour , this may be the place for you .<ssssss>if you be look for some place peaceful , look elsewhere .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 4 2 3 3		go club ... all the way !!<ssssss>have a great few day at the art hotel with some friend .<ssssss>the room be ok , not fabulous as i expect it to be at the price .<ssssss>we have book the club level room , and that be we best decision , if you can afford it then go for it .<ssssss>the champagne be flow , and the food service be small but delicious .<ssssss>very tasty and we do not feel the need to go to a restaurant every meal time as the food in the lounge be sufficient.the rest of the hotel be nice ... but very expensive .<ssssss>you have to pay for everything you use , even the coffee in the room , which be a little bizarre as it be so very expensive anyway.i would go back and i do recommend it though.enjoy !!!<ssssss>

4 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		excellent location , small room stya there in november .<ssssss>excellent location , just minute walk from the chueca area and the metro station .<ssssss>breakfast be great .<ssssss>good selection , fresh food and friendly staff.the only issue i have be that i book a double bed , and the room be so small the double bed be push up against the wall which mean that i have to sleep face the wall.apart from that , i would return !<ssssss>
3 3 3 2 3 3 4 1		decent hotel option altogether , the experience you get at this hotel be what you would expect .<ssssss>the service be fine and the room be clean and by-the-book .<ssssss>the only real downside be the ludicrously high charge to use the internet in the business center - the worst i experience during my two week in china .<ssssss>the location be not amazing , but it be only a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station , and it should be note the beij subway system be top-notch , so you will be able to get anywhere you want to go fairly quickly from there .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 5 3 5		ok experience we have a ok experience at hotel st marie .<ssssss>the hotel be in a good location if you want to see bourbon street every night .<ssssss>if you want to avoid bourbon street stay somewhere else .<ssssss>even if you do not plan on hang out on bourbon street , you will have to cross the street everytime you go back to the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel staff be good and helpful .<ssssss>however , the room have paper thin wall and you can hear everything happen in the room next door ... such as people come back to they room late at night , door slamming , fight , and people get sick in they bathroom .<ssssss>if you be a partier and you dont ' mind all of this , then this be the hotel for you .<ssssss>if you be a family or a romantic couple , stay somewhere else .<ssssss>
3 4 4 2 5 5 4 -1		cool but inconvenient the ku ` damm 101 be a very cool , minimalist hotel in a quiet area , however the hotel itself be not quiet and the neighborhood be inconvenient to most of the sight i want to see .<ssssss>one problem that modern , no-carpet , spare hotel seem to have be the amount of noise that carry from room to room and in the hall .<ssssss>tje first two of five night i be there i could hear door slam all morning and night which irritated I .<ssssss>the breakfast spread be wonderful and the top floor , sunny location of the dining room be a joy to start the day in .<ssssss>have the hotel be in a central location , i would still recommend it , but if you be plan to hit the sight and hang out more often in the mitte section of town , stay somewhere more central .<ssssss>i spend a good 1/2 hour to 45 minute every day one-way get to where i want to go .<ssssss>i do a lot of schlepping and in the rain it be not too pleasant .<ssssss>they really be not much at all of interest in the local area .<ssssss>
3 2 5 5 5 5 4 3		a rip-off , though i do heart the comfy bed .<ssssss>after several night of inn and motel on my road trip , i be so ready to sleep on a nice fluffy bed with equally fluffy pillow and duvet .<ssssss>hotel 480 do not disappoint .<ssssss>check-in be a breeze , and the staff be extremely courteous .<ssssss>the location make it easy to walk almost everywhere we want to go , which be great , because who want to drive in sf ?<ssssss>i have no complaint about my experience here ; in fact , i would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone ... that be , anyone with deep pocket .<ssssss>internet access be $ 10 per day , and parking be approximately $ 50 a day after tax .<ssssss>now , i be from la so i be use to pay premium price for parking and mandatory valet , but $ 50 be a sticker shock , even for I .<ssssss>in the end , everything add up to almost $ 300 a night for a room in a three-star hotel .<ssssss>we have a good experience here , but not that good .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		the perfect location we stay at the wharf inn after several trip to san francisco because of the location .<ssssss>you just can not beat it for the price and the free parking .<ssssss>you could stay at the raddison which be right across the street , but expect to pay about $ 30-40 more then add $ 28 a day for parking , just not worth it .<ssssss>now for some detail , the room be very spacious , compare to the other 3 hotel that we have stay in , and be clean .<ssssss>although they do not advertise it , you can get free wireless internet service with no problem at the hotel .<ssssss>the desk staff be very friendly and knowledgable with any info .<ssssss>you may need for sightseeing and location .<ssssss>the only problem that i could tell anyone about be that there be no air-conditioning in the room , while this may not sound like a problem due to the average temp in sfo be in the 50 's and 60 's , it be .<ssssss>there be only a very small window about 2x2 and it be located at the bottom of window and behind the curtain .<ssssss>my solution be to buy a small powerfull fan for about $ 12 and put it in the window so we could get some outside -lrb- cool -rrb- air .<ssssss>if you want to be right in the heart of everything that sfo have to offer , then you will not find a better bargain .<ssssss>most all hotel in this area be at least + $ 230 a night .<ssssss>so my suggestion be to book this on early , get a little window fan and use the money you save to enjoy all the wonderful fruit that sfo have to offer .<ssssss>if you need any more info on sfo or this hotel , i would be glad to answer , just e-mail I .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 1 3 2 1		nova-hell : that what the local call it ... ... and i agree.where do i start ?<ssssss>oh - the internet ... 3rd world speed at sky high price .<ssssss>if the hotel contract this service , they need to cancel it - it be tragically unusable.we stay in a double room street side -lrb- not harbour side -rrb- and the hotel room be more bland than boil old beans.back in 1992 , this may have be cool but people !<ssssss>its 2008 !<ssssss>this place have be thrash - stain and knock everywhere .<ssssss>i shudder to think how old the mattress be .<ssssss>funny thing though - the 20 inch flat screen tv in the room look so out of place on the stork its on - its small , look pathetic and do not go with the decor .<ssssss>sadly it have a internet keyboard nearby - i be too scared to use it in case i rack up many more $ .<ssssss>the cleanliness of the room be below average , the exterior old and the lobby be in sad need of a wake up call.the staff be average -lrb- the only fun be have with the eurocar rental dude -rrb- and the breakfast be shoddy.if you be not pay for it , stay here .<ssssss>if you be - avoid at all cost - see my travelodge review -lrb- which i think be a 100x better place than this sad property -rrb- .<ssssss>pro : locationcon : everything .<ssssss>
2 1 2 3 2 1 2 5		not impressed my husband and i stay there one night in june.the hotel -lrb- well ... i think they could call it motel -rrb- look very dated.the room be not very clean -lrb- spiderweb all behind the fridge and bed etc -rrb- , the carpet be dirty .<ssssss>however the bathroom be very space with a excellent power-shower -lrb- look new as well -rrb- .<ssssss>the price include breakfast too :--rrb- which be definitely the strangest hotel breakfast experience of my life -lrb- little plastic table and chair etc -rrb- .<ssssss>they have a spacious parking lot which be a bonus in san francisco .<ssssss>
4 -1 5 3 5 5 3 -1		stylish room , non-central location what a lovely hotel - and really rather reasonably price , which i be assume be because of the somewhat out-of-the-way location.location : not central berlin , but right next to a metro line to get into the city .<ssssss>there be not a lot go on around the hotel , to be honest , although the hotel bar seem nice enough -lrb- if not the hotb of chic that the website would have you believe -rrb- .<ssssss>cleanliness : spotless .<ssssss>as you would expect.style : warm yet minimalist - kind of a plush ikea , if that make any sense .<ssssss>everything be rather nice.rooms : we choose a fairly big room , which have both a free standing bath inside the room and a separate shower cubicle in the washroom .<ssssss>it be up in the eaves and therefore you have to be careful with the slope ceiling .<ssssss>the room be great , with a mini-bar fridge and generally well lay out with amenity .<ssssss>huge bed with crisp white linen.quietness / privacy : we could not hear we neighbour .<ssssss>we have a very relax stay in this hotel.faciliites : we only use the bar , which be fine , but in april 07 at least they seem to stop serve food very early on .<ssssss>there be no 24 hour room service .<ssssss>obligatory shoe-shine machine on each floor , and provide iron and iron board on request .<ssssss>do not use the restaurant at all , or any other facility at the hotel.check in : the front desk be really helpful and friendly , although when we get back at about 2am on a sunday morning -lrb- this be party berlin ! -rrb-<ssssss>there be not anyone around for a bit to let we back in to the hotel which be a bit annoying.overall : excellent hotel , be extremely good value for money , but if you want to be in the thick of thing you will find the neighbourhood very quiet .<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 4 4 4 5		a average hotel .<ssssss>we stay here for 3 night en route to new england for a skiing holiday , and overall , it be okay .<ssssss>i be probably a little disappointed in it and maybe have higher expectation base on the review here .<ssssss>the hotel be modern , but the room we have be a little small , a little scuffed round the edge , have a lot of traffic noise , have a queen bed rather than a king and do not have a bath tub , only a shower .<ssssss>the lack of bath probably would not bother some people , but as we be do a lot of walking/sightseeing and fancy a soak to rejuvenate the foot and leg , we ask for a room with a tub after the first night .<ssssss>the staff be very good and immediately change we to a slightly higher floor room , with a tub , and strangely about twice the space although the room type be supposedly the same .<ssssss>this room actually prove to be much better and be quiet as it be at the back of the hotel .<ssssss>unfortunately as someone else point out , as it be low down it be actually dark the whole day , even on the glorious sunny day that we have .<ssssss>the safe in this room be lock when we get in , so we ask for it to be open for we and the staff say it would be do right away .<ssssss>it be not .<ssssss>we ask again the next day and be tell again it would be do .<ssssss>after come back to the room late that night , we find it still have not be do .<ssssss>no big deal , but as we be check out the next day , it be not worth ask again.on the plus side , the staff be genuinely pleasant , the location be really good , the wine reception be a nice touch and the hotel offer free wi-fus .<ssssss>there be nothing that bad about the hotel and nothing that great either .<ssssss>it be a little too focus on style , and while the staff be pleasant , the service be a little hit or miss .<ssssss>base on this visit , i would not stay at nine zero again .<ssssss>
3 3 3 -1 5 -1 2 -1		good location have stay here a couple of time .<ssssss>the hotel be basic for the cost and so much more could be do with it base on its great heritage .<ssssss>the hotel do not offer much by way of facility , expensive breakfast and a small dingy bar but the room be comfy dispite be very basic but have some charm about they .<ssssss>the loctaion be the best thing as it be in a quiet residential area next to a small school yet it be only a short walk to all the main area .<ssssss>that be the main reason i always choose this hotel .<ssssss>
3 4 3 2 3 2 1 -1		beautiful beach , but resort be a disappointment we stay at the grand paradise bavaro in late february 2006 .<ssssss>we have not do a be since we be young , and have decide to give the dominican republic a try .<ssssss>this report will be long.i read all the review after i have book -lrb- book somewhat last minute on travel agent recommendation -rrb- , and i become very nervous .<ssssss>we go with a open mind and want to enjoy we trip .<ssssss>we be not picky and just want to relax .<ssssss>i think maybe some of the other posting be from people who expect a lot or who be very hard to please .<ssssss>i have to agree with a lot of negative things.on arrival , the resort do not look quite as nice as some of the other we have see during the ride on the airport transfer .<ssssss>no problem , because i have find that sometimes the inside be beautiful and you do not spend you vacation outside stare at the entrance to the resort .<ssssss>we be please with the furnishings and the landscaping of the resort .<ssssss>this be one of the smaller resort and we do not expect alot of glitz .<ssssss>we be book in the club section but be take to the main section -lrb- beach side -rrb- for check-in .<ssssss>needless to say , we have to be take back to the club side to check-in .<ssssss>we have to ask many question to find out about thing - the staff be personable but not forthcoming with information .<ssssss>i only know to ask about the tram that go from one section to the other because of this site .<ssssss>reservation have to be make for the ala-carte restaurants.we stay on the club side because the room be all jr. suite with a jacuzzi tub in the room and this side be much quieter -lrb- which be what we want -rrb- .<ssssss>the jacuzzi do not work at all .<ssssss>we room could not be change because they be sell out and we be repeatedly tell that someone be come up to fix it .<ssssss>they even tell we at one point that it be fix .<ssssss>it be not .<ssssss>this go on for 3 day .<ssssss>we finally give up .<ssssss>now , we have no perk for be in the nicer room because we be further from the beach .<ssssss>very disappointing.we leave a nice tip for the maid each day and we get soda water stock in the fridge .<ssssss>we leave a note ask for diet coke water only and she provide they the next day .<ssssss>after that we just leave the tip , and there be no restocking of the fridge .<ssssss>we have to call the front desk to get soda.we call for a iron one night and it take 3 hour .<ssssss>no apology , no excuse .<ssssss>actually , my husband have to wind up go to the front desk for it and then have to sign 3 different form to borrow it for 15 minutes.our best dinner be at the manglar on the club side .<ssssss>patron can dine at restaurant on either side of the resort .<ssssss>the wait staff here be incredible !<ssssss>very attentive and personable !<ssssss>it be difficult , and sometimes impossible to get coffee in the morning at the buffet .<ssssss>we be both bartender for over a dozen year and will be more patient than the next person because we can empathize , but service be ridiculously slow , and it be no better no matter how much you tip .<ssssss>even at some of the nicer restaurant for dinner .<ssssss>we often wait and wait for coffee to be serve to eat with the dessert that have be serve 20-30 minute prior .<ssssss>these restaurant be not pack to the gill and there be plenty of server available .<ssssss>we be frequent traveler to the caribbean and recognize that there be such a thing as island time -

4 4 4 2 5 5 5 1		a good value hotel .<ssssss>my girlfriend and i book this hotel because we have read the review on this site , and it be only go for about $ 60 for the poolside room .<ssssss>my first impression be that this hotel be a little old .<ssssss>check in be smooth , and the bellboy bring we luggage to the elevator .<ssssss>he press the down button on the elevator which i thought be strange , but then take we up to the third floor .<ssssss>i later find out that the up button do not work , but that no big problem .<ssssss>.<ssssss>all you have to do be just press the down button and select you floor .<ssssss>at any rate , the room be decent .<ssssss>the size be a bit bigger than a average hotel room , and it be clean.we be starve when we arrive so we order some room service , and the room service be decent price .<ssssss>we get some spaghetti for less than $ 10 , and it be really good spaghetti i get ta say.although most people be not gon na care , i at least love the submerge pool bar .<ssssss>you can order a cocktail and get a carve out fruit with the drink inside the fruit and sit inside the pool while you drink it .<ssssss>i think that be great , and find that this definitely beat have to get out of the pool to get a drink at a table -lrb- but that just I -rrb- .<ssssss>the pool usually have very few people in it , so even though it be small , its adequate.the breakfast buffet be not the best food .<ssssss>its a bit worse than average for hotel food.the hotel be quite big so to walk from one end to the other can be a few minute , but we find that you can just cut through the middle through the pool area , and get to you room quicker rather than walk all the way around the hotel past every hotel room.all in all , i would recommend this hotel if you do not want to spend so much money , but do not want to be in a tacky hotel .<ssssss>if you be look for a amazing hotel , this place be not for you , but if you be look for the bang for the buck ... i would definitely recommend this place .<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 5 5 5 2		a great overall experience the vibe hotel be awesome !<ssssss>after read some of the review before book this hotel , i be skepical .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but , it be clean , great attendance , the only problem i have be with the remote , do not mess around with it , if it be not work .<ssssss>i be there for two day on my own , feel very safe !<ssssss>i stay in the hotel for a total of 5 day .<ssssss>food , of course be expensive , but ... if you be hungry and not sure where to go .<ssssss>.<ssssss>just step outside the hotel , go left from the hotel and then about 2 or 3 block go left and you will run into china town , lot of different food and good price .<ssssss>you can walk just about anywhere , but lady , watch the high heel , they will get you foot !<ssssss>i take off and just walk and discover so much ... the opera house , botanical garden , the park , a dinner cruise be awesome , you can see the city night light , the shopping ... so much to do .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the weather be great !<ssssss>my overall experience with the hotel ... great !<ssssss>i would definitely stay there again !<ssssss>clean , curtious staff , quiet ... and they be all accommodate !<ssssss>best advise on get there from the airport ... catch a shuttle !<ssssss>i take the taxi ... $ 50 , plus i tip $ 5 .<ssssss>.<ssssss>which i find out later , do not need to do that !<ssssss>i be overcharge to begin with .<ssssss>i take the shuttle back to the airport and it be great !<ssssss>a few stop on the way , but the conceire tell we what time to catch to get to the a/p on time and it be fine !<ssssss>
5 5 2 5 5 4 5 -1		great place what a great place !<ssssss>i stop there with six other mate and although we all go for a lad weekend , we be just interested in the beer and the partying .<ssssss>when i book the hotel i be a bit apprehensive after read the review , however i need n`t have worried.we arrive on the friday morning just after 10am although it say you can n`t check in until 11am they check we in early which be very good.we leave we luggage in a lock room as the room be n`t ready until 2pm which be fair enough.we come back just after 2pm go into we room and be shock as the room have n`t be serviced.i go to the reception and tell they about this , the guy on reception make a quick phone call and apologise to we and say if we all go to the bar we could have a free beer on them.whithin half a hour the room be service and be absolutely spotless .<ssssss>we stay in room 2 , a 8 bed dorm on the gound floor which be hot as there be only a small window -lrb- for security reason ? -rrb-<ssssss>but other than that it be ok .<ssssss>this be the only hiccup we have all weekend and we think the staff be great , very polite and friendly .<ssssss>there be some great offer on at the bar : bottled stella 2 for 1 at 4 euro etc.and the food be great -lrb- recommend the chili con carne ! -rrb-<ssssss>a good breakfast with fresh orange juice , bread , meat , cheese , jam ,3 type of cereal , fruit , tea and coffee .<ssssss>all in all a very relax place to stay -lrb- maybe they have take negative comment from website such as these on board ? -rrb-<ssssss>i would thoroughly recommend this as a place to stay.don ` t expect the ritz , as you get what you pay for , but out of the budget hostel i have stay in , this one be the best by far .<ssssss>relax and enjoy !<ssssss>
5 3 3 5 3 4 5 -1		a great family get away !<ssssss>my family of 4 -lrb- all adult -rrb- recently enjoy 5 wonderful night at the rio mar wyndham resort .<ssssss>we travel quite a bit and have a lot of hotels/resorts to compare it to and although the room themselves could use some update , we all agree that the rio mar be great and would recommend it to anyone .<ssssss>the resort be located in a gated community with nice grounds , which allow for a nice area to roam around outside -lrb- which be especially nice if you like to walk/run like we do -rrb- .<ssssss>from check-in to check-out we experience the wonderful service that the rio mar have to offer .<ssssss>i will say , you do pay for it as there be a 14 % service fee tack on to the bill at the end of you stay , but at least we feel like we get what we pay for .<ssssss>every staff person we walk by greet we , employee -lrb- especially angel -rrb- be always available at the beach to help we get chair or set up a umbrella , the towel hut staff gladly switch we we damp towel for fresh one when need , and the valet provide we with cold water at the front door when we get back from we morning walks/runs .<ssssss>we do eat most of we meal on site at the resort and very much enjoy both of we dinner at palio -lrb- exceptional service too ! -rrb-<ssssss>and shima .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet at marbella be a treat one morning as well .<ssssss>we enjoy the convenience of be able to get a quick bagel or muffin at erl -lrb- near the lobby -rrb- and both seabreeze and the tiki bar provide delicious lunch while overlook the beach or pool as well as good service .<ssssss>as far as price , we do not find the price particularly high , especially since we be at a resort , but as i say , we do travel a lot and perhaps be use to resort prices.the area that the resort be in itself be perfect .<ssssss>a short 35-45 min car ride to old san juan and less than 15 minute to the el yunque rain forest .<ssssss>my recommendation would be to rent a car because you can easily drive and navigate yourself around the rain forst .<ssssss>the staff at the rain forest visitor center be most helpful in point we in the right direction of trail and waterfall .<ssssss>a visit to old san juan be also worth the trip - the street be nice to walk through as well as a visit to the fort .<ssssss>if you be look for a wonderful meal - try dragonfly !<ssssss>the rio mar be a perfect place for family , or couple too !<ssssss>it be not overwhelmingly big but big enough .<ssssss>there be many family with kid there , however there be also a adult pool if you want to relax without a lot of kid run around .<ssssss>i also have never be to a beach with so many chair !<ssssss>overall the rio mar be a wonderful place for a vacation and puerto rico be the perfect spot for a mix of relaxation and activity in nice weather !<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 4 5 3 2		average hotel the plus for this hotel be the location .<ssssss>i get the room with the view of the harbour and it be pretty awesome .<ssssss>another thing be it be pretty close to the mid level escalator , which be very convenient to get to central .<ssssss>also the escalator pass many nice cafe and shop as well as lan kwai fong , one of the happen spot of hong kong .<ssssss>the hotel be really nicely located as it be not stuck smack bang in the middle of the hong kong maddening hustle and bustle but it be close enough .<ssssss>they also provide free shuttle service downtown.the downside be the size of the room - shockingly small !<ssssss>

4 2 4 3 2 4 3 -1		good hotel , but overprice for what it be stay 2 night in hotel jazz , we have upgrade to a jr suite , which be a lovely room , very spacious , all mod con , maybe a little ` wear ' in place , fridge not work , nor aircon , but do not spend enough time in he room to make a issue of these thing .<ssssss>other than a great room , the hotel have nothing to offer , breakfast -lrb- include in we deal -rrb- be only so so , waitress be run away hide in the klitchen instead of see to people 's table , you have to literally go stand by the kitchen door to grab one of they as they come out to ask for you coffee , a omelette etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>and then they still ignore you , also not much choice , but hey it be only a 3-star .<ssssss>the bar be always empty , the barman hide somewhere , we always have to go and find he to serve we a drink .<ssssss>location , in my view , not so great , true it be close to plaza catalunya for access to public transport , but area have nothing to offer , no nice bar or restaurant .<ssssss>i would recommend you can find hotel slightly out of the city centre much much cheaper , offer better facility -lrb- spa , restaurant , etc. -rrb- and use the metro for the time you want to come into the city centre .<ssssss>we pay far too much for a hotel like hotel jazz which have not much to offer .<ssssss>they do allow we a very late check-out till 7 pm , and do not charge extra for it , maybe we be just lucky there ... .<ssssss>would not recommend because of its cost - not good value for money .<ssssss>

1 1 1 3 2 1 1 3		noisy !<ssssss>have just return from stay one night at this hotel i feel the need to give a honest opinion about it .<ssssss>give the fabulous review most people have give i feel quite confident about book this place .<ssssss>it be easy enough to find -lrb- although none of the local have hear of it -rrb- and first impression be good - trendy smart reception area , smooth background music , comfy leather furniture etc. we room be a studio apartment on the 6th floor with a large roof terrace -lrb- the main reason for booking -rrb- .<ssssss>the immediate impression of the room be quite good - modern , light but a somewhat cold feeling.we have ask for a double bed - it look tiny and feel like a large single -lrb- no good if you happen to be 6 foot tall and use to king size !<ssssss>during the day the room seem ok and not too noisy , but at night the traffic drone on and on and on and on !!!<ssssss>also we tiny bed be next to some crucial plumbing and i be wake everytime anyone in the hotel use they bathroom.i find it impossible to sleep because of the noise and spend the night toss and turn in the tiny bed with a cheap mattress.i be consequently too tired to appreciate barcelona the next day and resent parting with 140 euro when for Â£15 i have a great sleep at the stansted airport ` be new travellodge !<ssssss>the staff be also incompetent and frosty -lrb- it take over 30 minute to check out because the receptionist be obviously computer illiterate .<ssssss>in short this place be mutton dress as lamb and i would n`t even rate it as a 1 star hotel.what a rip off !<ssssss>
4 4 5 2 5 3 4 1		great hotel this be a great hotel , if you want modern style as appose to old world charm .<ssssss>the room , mine 538 be a deluxe and enormous , have a dress room 12 foot of window look over the port and city.lcd tv marble bathrooom and great cleaniliness and quality.most of all the breakfast be enormous , every food you can imagine.only downfall be that its not in the city centre , but hey nothing a 20 minute walk wont fix.well worth the money if you get a deluxe room with breakfast include .<ssssss>
4 2 3 5 4 3 -1 -1		good location , clean , but spendy !<ssssss>hotel 's lcoation be convenient and close to a lot of thing to do .<ssssss>hotel be in a old buidle with nicely do room .<ssssss>the lobby area be small and ` feel ' crowd .<ssssss>though the room be small , the room do contain a king size bed , sit chair w/ottoman and business desk .<ssssss>room be clean and bed be comfortable .<ssssss>even with the expect higher rate of a downtown location , i find the price per night to be expensive for the room i have .<ssssss>with the hotel close proximity to restaurant and its ' downtown location , garbage truck be out in force begin around 4:30 be empty the dumpster in the area .<ssssss>it be quite loud .<ssssss>and begin around 6am the food and service delivery truck for the restaurant begin make they delivery .<ssssss>from the hotel it be a short walk to a variety of restaurant and bar .<ssssss>also , it be close to qunicy market , faneuil hall , old state house and shopping .<ssssss>for something a little different .<ssssss>we take a water taxi to logan airport instead of regular taxi .<ssssss>the water taxi can be pick up behind the harbor place hotel -lrb- about two block from the hilton -rrb- , rate be $ 10 , and it drop you off on airport property where you can pick up a bus shuttle to the terminal .<ssssss>it provide great view of boston .<ssssss>
2 2 3 1 4 2 2 3		not great value i would not stay here again for a number of reason .<ssssss>it be location be really bad , quite a way from anything interesting , and it be on a main road so very noisy .<ssssss>the room be not too bad , a little small , but adequate .<ssssss>however the soundproofing between the room be terrible and we have to complain to the room next to we then to hotel security when they would not keep quiet .<ssssss>the room service and restaurant be very expensive particularly consider how much you pay at local restaurant .<ssssss>the staff be not that friendly and we have to get we own taxi .<ssssss>the worst part be the small pool which turn green while we be there .<ssssss>when we ask the staff about it they say it be suppose to be green as they be do something to it ... minute later we see a hotel employee sneak out and dump undiluted chlorine into the pool , right next to where people be swim .<ssssss>we do not swim after that .<ssssss>

3 2 3 4 4 4 2 -1		good location nice look central hotel .<ssssss>grandiose lobby and entrance area and room nicely do and spacious enough .<ssssss>on the down-side , we have to ask 4 time for the cot that we would pre-book to be bring to the room , the only lift can be a very long walk from you room and the service for breakfast in the oak room deteriotae over the 3 morning from ok to very poor .<ssssss>
3 2 2 4 3 5 4 3		so-so experience location be good , border chinatown , walk distance to the embarquadero , but can be noisy when dumpster be empty at 4 be in the alley below , or from the agreeable bar next door , the irish bank .<ssssss>be first assign to the unabomber cabin room , which be kind of funky at first -- until we realize there be no place to put any of we stuff .<ssssss>agreeable staff move we to another room , but all quite small .<ssssss>try to get one with a closet ; otherwise there be no place for you stuff .<ssssss>staff be nice and friendly ; we pass on the minimal breakfast and go around the block to a great bagel place .<ssssss>we pay $ 169 a night , and $ 199 on sit night , which we think be a lot for what we get ; would probably have like it more if we have pay less .<ssssss>

4 4 2 5 4 5 3 -1		good value for money like other fellow traveller we be rather dubious as to what appear to be alot of hotel but for not a lot of money !<ssssss>however the five of we -lrb- 2 adult and we 3 daughter aged 17 17 and 15 -rrb- fly out on aug 15th only to arrive amid a tropical storm ... .<ssssss>handle very badly by we tour operator first choice but that be another story .<ssssss>here go we review : receiption : spacious , clean , nice furnishings , staff very helpfull.rooms : okay , nothing special and perhaps a little dated , good bathroom with large bath -lrb- big enough for 2 adult to lie/sit in comfortably -rrb- reasonable shower .<ssssss>air con be good , mini bar re stock daily -lrb- all contents free -rrb- maid service : we struggle with this ... you never know what time she be come .<ssssss>often it would be around 4pm well we be usually have we daily siesta then !<ssssss>and one time when i be particualrly poorly with s d she just would not go away despite I explain i be not well and for she to come back tomorrow !!!!<ssssss>pool : good size , clean , staff always around to bring you drink .<ssssss>sunbed be in good condition and if you want shade it be necessary to get up around 7 to reserve you bed which be no bother really as my husband be up early each morning .<ssssss>pool bar be good , the often have a selection of drink serve in whole coconut and pineapple along with frsh fruit kebab in the morning .<ssssss>pool music be fine , typically spanish which for I be a nice change .<ssssss>we never use the swim up bar as on the 2 or 3 occasion we try it seem very much like be down you local pub as all the same face be on all the same stool so we give it a miss.beach : lovely , plenty of sunbed and usually shade be available too which we find most surpising .<ssssss>pure white sand and clear blue sea for about 30 metre .<ssssss>yes there be sea weed but certainly not mass of it and it wasn ' y black slimy or smelly !<ssssss>what i do find odd be that they have beach staff clean up sea weed off the beach umpteen time a day ??<ssssss>wholly unnecessary in my opinion .<ssssss>beach bar be fine .<ssssss>entertainement on the beach be okay , by that i mean the animation team do not hassle you all the time to compete in they tournaments.restaurants : we find all the buffet restaurant okay , all have a excellent selection of meat and fish dish .<ssssss>cleanliness be excellent .<ssssss>a la carte be good ... stay clear og the italian though as we food be diabolical , they even charge you for wine and it be by the bottle too !<ssssss>japanese be good , as be the steak house and the mexican.enertainment : poor , the animation team enthusiasm be fantastic , however they skill and ability be not .<ssssss>grounds : lovely , plenty of lush greenery , well maintain garden , flowerbed and bush .<ssssss>the gardner would always ask if you wante a fresh coconut cut down too which i thought be a nice touch .<ssssss>there be duck , goose and kitten too !<ssssss>they be all lovely and appreciate the restaurant fresh bread roll -lrb- often eat gently from you hand -rrb- .<ssssss>i think that about cover everything , in short nothing about we stay at this hotel be fantastic or out of this world we get what we pay for , i think the hotel be more a 3 star than 4 .<ssssss>

1 1 4 4 4 1 1 1		customer service do not exist here ... pay lot of money for a room in a killer location but do not expect any kind of decent customer service at this hotel.i have be here almost a week for work and they just consistently try to make thing hard for me.charging I for stuff i do not touch in the mini-bar , extra charge for internet -lrb- 7 day worth for 5 day -rrb- , can not answer my question when i call front desk ... and all with a bit of attitude as if they do not really want to be bother help at all.is it because of the reputation of this hotel ?<ssssss>it be book out and popular , that be for sure ... so maybe they do not have to try anymore?westin be synonymous with poor quality and bad attitude for I ... and i will make sure i avoid they from now on in any city .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 2 3 4 -1		everything but the room be great this resort be recently take over by barcelo and perhaps some of the problem we encounter be a result of the transition .<ssssss>most of the problem have to do with the maintenance and condition of we room , which need update badly .<ssssss>the first problem we encounter be the lack of hot water in we room .<ssssss>we discover this the morning after we check in and it take 2-3 call to get this repair .<ssssss>the second problem be that they do not have any safe key when we check in , and we have to wait until the follow morning to get a safe key -lrb- which require a $ 20 deposit -rrb- .<ssssss>then , although they stock the mini-fridge with 2 bottle of water , 2 coke and 1 sprite , we do not have a bottle opener !<ssssss>we have to track down a housekeeper on the second day to get one -lrb- she take one out of another room , so i be sure someone else later encounter the same problem -rrb- .<ssssss>the general housekeeping be hit and miss ; we have 2 washclothe when we check in , which be remove when use , but not replace .<ssssss>one day , the bath mat be remove but not replace .<ssssss>another day , the toilet paper be not replenish and we run out !<ssssss>also , there be some sort of stain on the wall above the bed that be not clean -lrb- do not even want to guess what it be -rrb- .<ssssss>the room and bathroom generally need update .<ssssss>the grounds be nice - 3 pool and lot of chaise lounge on the beach .<ssssss>one downside : not a lot of bathroom close to the various pool or the beach .<ssssss>we do not get to try all of the restaurant , but those we try be good .<ssssss>there be usually some concert or show in the plaza for a couple of hour each night , and one night there be a beach party .<ssssss>other than that , not a lot of night life at the resort .<ssssss>there be a disco , but it be only okay .<ssssss>one nice thing be that you could pay at the mini-market -lrb- and in the surround little beach store -rrb- in u.s. dollar and receive you change in u.s. dollar .<ssssss>however , the front desk would not make change for you -lrb- i.e. , give you 2 ten for a twenty or what-have-you -rrb- .<ssssss>everyone there be very friendly and welcome .<ssssss>i would not go back to this particular resort - i speak with lot of people at the airport on the way home , and there be lot of other good option , from the sound of it .<ssssss>

trip wouldnt you rather have a seat , relax and have food ? -rrb-<ssssss>i dont think people realize that when they give you you wrist band this give you the opportunity to go anywhere in the resort , no question ask !<ssssss>if you think you might want to go to the beach wear you bathing suit under you clothes .<ssssss>after eat and relax for a while ... .<ssssss>it be we choice to stay at the buffet until the line clear ... i mean why rush we be go to be there for 10 day and we didnt want to start off we vacation with a bad attitude .<ssssss>we be immediately upgrade to a carribean spa sweet .<ssssss>we be on the ground floor .<ssssss>although out room have a leak we didnt really mind because we be warn ahead of time , and we be upgrade for free !!<ssssss>within 2 hour there be a repair man in the room fix the leak and we didnt have a problem for the rest of we vacation.there be so many activity to do both in and outside the resort we be glad we have 10 day so that we could do something different everyday and still have time to go to the beach.everynight have a different theme both at the buffet and at the show at 10:00 .<ssssss>every friday vendor come in so that you can shop in the resort if you sone feel comfortable leave .<ssssss>very accomodate if you ask I .<ssssss>if you want to shop you have to bargain , and these vendor look forward to it !<ssssss>if you be a cheap and spoil american like so many of we be ... .<ssssss>prove to they that just because we be american doesnt mean we be stupid and rich !!<ssssss>if you see something you like think about how much it would probably cost here .<ssssss>then ask how much it be .<ssssss>if you dont like the price then think about how much you would like to pay for it without be completely selfish because this be how they make a living .<ssssss>they will eventually give in .<ssssss>they also have a beach party with a huge bonfire and drink on friday .<ssssss>also on wednesday they have a disco tour .<ssssss>provide that you be at least 18 year of age you can pay 10 dollar to go on a bus to a local club for about 4 hour my friend and i enjoy it very much .<ssssss>also , the 10 dollar cover for

because you be on vacation ... but you should probably stack up here before you go over there .<ssssss>if you choose not to use a call card its 2 dollar a minute.if you be adventurous and you dont mind hang out with local like I and my friend you can take the public bus and a taxi .<ssssss>all you have to do be ask and you will get the answer .<ssssss>the bus be 2 dollar if you go to the next city over call higuey and about a dollar if you go to plaza bavaro which be like a huge mall with alot if the same store and a few place to eat there be also a bank and a waetern union .<ssssss>if you

buy dive shampoo for 3.00 , pretty much the same that you would pay here .<ssssss>if you want to take a taxi to the plaza or el cortecito its about 6.00 .<ssssss>not bad consider you could stay for as long as you want .<ssssss>now , we also ask how much it would be to take a taxi to higuey its 50 dollar round trip and they wait 2 hour for you .<ssssss>so if theres two of you , you could pay 25 each

4 5 3 -1 4 -1 3 -1		a fine place to stay .<ssssss>entrance to chinatown - grant plaza be last building in view on the leave up the hill<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 2 5 4 4		beautiful room , but housekeeping need more monitor we stay at hotel keppler during we 4-day trip in paris .<ssssss>overall , i really enjoy my stay in the hotel .<ssssss>the decor be wonderful , and the conceige and bell-boy be both very helpful .<ssssss>but , i do have a few thing to point out :1 .<ssssss>i have no soap in my bathroom until the last day of my stay .<ssssss>not sure why that be the case , but i have to go hunt for a bar of soap on my first day in paris2 .<ssssss>one of the day , when the maid clean we room , she take all the towel that be on the floor and do not replace they .<ssssss>however , when i call housekeeping for additional towel , they be deliver immediately .3 .<ssssss>and i do discover some hair strand on the throw that do not belong to I , which be a bit disturbing .<ssssss>i understand the throw might be difficult to clean at time , and the dirt be quite noticable when the throw be white .<ssssss>but , i think the hotel should make a effort to clean the throw , especially when the customer be be charge a premium for the rooms.other than that , the hotel have live up to its review .<ssssss>
5 5 2 5 3 4 4 -1		excellent value it be we first time to hawaii and for the location and view , it be excellent .<ssssss>value .<ssssss>the only problem we have be the humidity in the room .<ssssss>the room size be a bit small and the bathroom be old .<ssssss>apart from this , i do not think we could have get a better value for we dollar elsewhere along the waterfront.the front desk staff be really friendly and meet we need in a timely fashion .<ssssss>definitely would stay here again and highly recommend it .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 4 4 4 -1		generally disappointing - but good location we stay 3 night at the oscar in june .<ssssss>overall , we experience be disappointing .<ssssss>to lead with the positive - it be in a terrific location ; walk distance to everything .<ssssss>the front desk staff be all very nice .<ssssss>the top pool area be very cool .<ssssss>breakfast be completely adequate - service there be very nice.however , when we initially check in , we be give a room with a completely soaked carpet outside of the bathroom .<ssssss>we initially think it be a leak from the a/c , but the staff simply bring they housekeeper up to talk to we who be embarrass to admit she spill water from a bucket .<ssssss>no big deal , except they be completely book and only could give we a handicap room - or move we the next day .<ssssss>we opt to move the next day and be give a -lrb- very -rrb- slight upgrade .<ssssss>we first room have a view of a wall .<ssssss>the second room have a view of the plaza , which be a improvement to be sure.both room be quite shoddy in execution .<ssssss>thing like the shower door not close or open without create a huge mess , peel paint , awkward sink and ridiculous lighting systems.we also be surprise that we be not tell about the pool area when we check in .<ssssss>it be on we last evening that we remember we have read about it on tripadvisor and decide to take a look .<ssssss>it be cool , though service be snarky -lrb- at best -rrb- .<ssssss>the most disturbing experience be come home around 2:30 am and find we hotel door wide open .<ssssss>after peer around to make sure no one be in there and try to check to see if we belongings be all there -lrb- which i believe they be -rrb- we call downstairs .<ssssss>the staff tell we that perhaps we do not close the door all the way .<ssssss>when i say that would be surprising since that have never happen to I before , he say it actually would not be because they have a lot of problem with people think they close the door , but not actually latch it and then they blow open .<ssssss>hu ???<ssssss>that might actually be true , but certainly , you should tell people when they check in!as a result of everything , i really can not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>there be a hostel on the other side of the plaza - probably no pool , but same location .<ssssss>
4 4 3 3 3 3 2 5		where do the irish go ?<ssssss>beautiful property in a very good neighborhood .<ssssss>decor , ambiance , it ` sall there and my wife and i would probably be back - but first we be go to check out another hotel on we next trip to boston .<ssssss>this wasour first with a overnight stay , and i be look forward to the irish hospitality and the attentive staff that other reviewer be rave about .<ssssss>i know irish hotel from the new york city , and they have -lrb- mostly -rrb- irish staff .<ssssss>however , if i be irish myself , i would probably opt to spend the summer in ireland too , which be where we both think the jury hotel staff have venture off for .<ssssss>we meet literally just 3 irish during we short stay , and the attention otherreviewer get during breakfast , dinner and the rest , well , it just be not quite there.the room be very nice and clean but need some maintenance -lrb- tear inthe bed linen , scratch on furniture , not entirely scrub down shower stall -rrb- .<ssssss>jean , the valet , be the one and only bright spot during we stay .<ssssss>hewa upbeat and really enjoy he work : welcome guest .<ssssss>all in all , we leave with mixed feeling , so next time we will check out some other hotel unless the jury have a good deal go because otherwise this be a good place to spend the night and have few drink at the bar .<ssssss>
2 3 4 -1 5 -1 2 -1		not gaga for zaza in summary , if you want to stay someplace hip and be not all that concerned about the level of service , i recommend hotel zaza .<ssssss>have stay in many 4 and 5 star hotel in the we and abroad i would rate my overall experience a 3 star with random 4 or 5 star service at time .<ssssss>after a few of my friend and co-worker who live in dalla say that hotel zaza be all the rage in dallas , a friend and i decide to book a two night stay there on a recent trip to check it out .<ssssss>to I the hotel have the feel of a w hotel but the interior design be much more unique .<ssssss>the entire hotel remind I of a hip-eclectic bar .<ssssss>that be where you will either appreciate or not the look of this place .<ssssss>i think that if i be in my twenty and into the club scene this would seem like the coolest place on earth .<ssssss>thing like a shag bag and tooth whitener in the mini bar selection be good chuckle for I , and the candy bar on my bed at night instead of a chocolate mint be fun -lrb- even though i do not eat it -rrb- .<ssssss>while the stay be entertaining at time , i will not stay there again .<ssssss>see it once be enough .<ssssss>if the service have be consistently better , i might choose to stay zaza again just so i can hang out at the pool .<ssssss>the location be also great .<ssssss>if you want detail on the service we experience , read on .<ssssss>i find the service to be hit and miss and mostly miss .<ssssss>the restaurant service for a saturday lunch be mediocre at best .<ssssss>the waiter be nice but they have too many large table and not enough wait staff .<ssssss>-lrb- it seem the local love the restaurant for birthday party and bridal shower . -rrb-<ssssss>the service be slow and when the waiter be at you table you feel like you better tell he what you need fast or he will be go .<ssssss>check-in be probably the worst experience .<ssssss>when my friend give the gentleman at the front counter she name , he get she first name wrong , and when she correct he , he say , close enough .<ssssss>the bellhop that take we bag to we room do not orient we to we room or the hotel - he actually do not speak to we at all .<ssssss>he be practically run out the door when we call he back for he tip .<ssssss>why do we do that ?<ssssss>we would have love to have know that coffee and tea be set up each morning outside of the elevator bank along with you choice of the ny time or the dalla paper .<ssssss>i only figure this out when i notice the coffee bar after return from the pool bar we second morning for $ 3 old fashion coffee -lrb- not include tip -rrb- .<ssssss>in the workout facility , they try to provide you with cold water , but the first morning the stainless steel bowl with ice be empty , and the second morning there be bottled water but no ice .<ssssss>we maid do not refill we soap , shampoo or lotion for we second night , which i thought be standard in a hotel of this caliber .<ssssss>they provide only one -lrb- tear -rrb- robe in a room with two double bed .<ssssss>we check-out be pleasant and easy .<ssssss>i think the valet service be attentive , and they hand we two cold minus bottle of water when we leave once and for all , which i thought be a nice touch give the 100 degree heat that day .<ssssss>i just wish i could have get that same cold bottle of water after sweating it a bit in the gym .<ssssss>

3 3 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		love the beach , would pass on the food we stay at the riu taino from feb 6 - feb 13 this month .<ssssss>we fly out of minneapolis on ryan international airline .<ssssss>great flight , have some cash handy - they sell breakfast sandwich or burrito for $ 5 each .<ssssss>liquor will cost you extra also , but we just pack a few personal size shooter of rum and vodka and add they into we pop .<ssssss>we travel with transglobal vacation and the rep kindly direct we to we bus when we get off the plane .<ssssss>however , someone have not do they homework and we wait on the bus for 45 min for the last couple , who the other people on the bus finally tell the tour guide have not even come with they group because of a family funeral and they be still in minneapolis !!!<ssssss>that be slightly annoying , but finally , we be on the road ... .<ssssss>go to check-in , and , apparently , we travel agent have not send we confirmation voucher with we , just some e-travel document which be not acceptable to the lady behind the counter .<ssssss>after some argue , we finally get we key and nobody bother we about the voucher during we stay , so they must have confirm it some other way ... .<ssssss>the beach be definitely the highlight of this trip - absolutely gorgeous , wide beach with soft , powdery white sand .<ssssss>the water be clear blue , and you can walk along the beach for mile and mile if you choose to .<ssssss>very pretty .<ssssss>the sound of the wave be about all you can hear on the beach , and it be very relaxing .<ssssss>the room be definitely acceptable .<ssssss>we stay in unit 292 , in the second row of bungalow on the first level .<ssssss>we could see and hear the ocean from we room and it be wonderful !!!!<ssssss>we love the privacy of the bungalow and be glad to have get a room so close to the beach .<ssssss>the room be always keep very clean by the maid .<ssssss>if you leave a few dollar , she will leave you one of the pretty towel/flower decoration .<ssssss>if no tip leave , no towel/flower arrangement .<ssssss>they will stock you refrigerator with 3 beer , never any more unless you leave a special request -lrb- and probably a few buck . -rrb-<ssssss>we be not in we room much beyond sleep and shower again in the evening before supper , so between the pop in the refrigerator , the liquor dispenser , and the 3 beer , we always have a evening drink to tide we over until we head out again .<ssssss>other thought : the food be not great , in we opinion .<ssssss>neither my husband or i be picky eater by any means , but we be both disappoint by the food .<ssssss>we never go hungry , but the flavor of the food be just not in agreement with we tastebud , even be open-minded .<ssssss>i would recommend ask for a table outside .<ssssss>we waiter be nice , but he be get drunk while serve we during friday night 's supper and forget to get we water and drink for half a hour !<ssssss>we be hope to have more opportunity to eat seafood , and after a week of hit-or-miss seafood option , we splurge on we last night and go to captain cook .<ssssss>$ 55 per person , but they pick you up on a bus , take you to the oceanside restaurant - very romantic !<ssssss>and you be give all the alcohol you would like -lrb- we have white wine and presidente beer -rrb- and a amazing , delicious meal with salad , appetizer , and a huge platter of seafood - it be incredible !!!<ssssss>finally satisfied we seafood craving and would make this trip to captain cook 's again in a heartbeat .<ssssss>they do not take credit card , however , so pack a extra $ 110 in cash if you want to check it out .<ssssss>some suggestion : 1 .<ssssss>take a few washcloth or a bath loofah as there will not be any washcloth supply in you room .<ssssss>2 .<ssssss>find a few wrist key-chain at the dollar store -lrb- as other review mention -rrb- .<ssssss>it be a easy way to keep track of you room and safe key .<ssssss>you can get a second room key for a ten dollar deposit , save you receipt , though , or you will have trouble get the ten buck back when you check out .<ssssss>3 .<ssssss>take a few insulate mug to save on trip back up to the bar .<ssssss>we also fill ours up before take off on a few stroll down the beach , and we 32 ounce mug get we there and back with outh get thirsty .4 .<ssssss>if you like seafood , there will be a poolside gumbo grill-out one day during the week - delicious !<ssssss>but they do not have much out there for food , so make sure you get there early !<ssssss>5 .<ssssss>one thing we be disappoint about be how several of the bartender seem to expect tip .<ssssss>we luckily have pack some extra cash after read other review on tripadvisor , but it get to be really annoying to tip so often when you have already pay for all-inclusive .<ssssss>6 .<ssssss>check out the outdoor hot tub at the riu palace macao after the sun have go down over the palm tree , but you be not quite ready to go back to you room .<ssssss>it be suppose to be just for palace people , but it be not guard and be completely desert when we go there .<ssssss>it be hide back in the foliage , and so relaxing , we feel like we disappear for a hour !!<ssssss>7 .<ssssss>check out the riu bambu - neat bar and a nice lunch area , too .<ssssss>great pool.all in all , a nice vacation .<ssssss>we would return to punta cana again someday , but not to the riu because of the food and because we want to check out some other resort .<ssssss>we friend have be at the iberostar and say it be excellent .<ssssss>avoid lti - look very scary !!!!!<ssssss>we pay $ 2,800 for two people , all tax , fee include .<ssssss>

3 4 3 5 5 4 3 3		cold !!!<ssssss>my wife , son and i stay at the berlin marriott in potsdamer platz for a week at the end of march 2008 , book with marriott reward point .<ssssss>let I start by state - cold .<ssssss>berlin be freezing then , most day 32-36 f highest temp , and snow flurry the first three day .<ssssss>we be socal people , so it be a bit unpleasant .<ssssss>despite the cold , the location of the berlin marriott make you stay - within walk distance of all the important tourist site in the mitte district , and have both u-bahn and s-bahn access nearly at you doorstep to take you anywhere and everywhere in berlin .<ssssss>berlin by far and away have the best public transportation system i have see , easy to use even if you do not speak german , and it go everywhere by over or underground train , bus or street tram -lrb- mostly in the older east berlin area -rrb- !<ssssss>berlin be historic , with a a history that need to be relearn and yet they growth out of wwii be also epic .<ssssss>there be so much to see and do , the museum and tourist site be everywhere and top notch .<ssssss>there be a strong effort for german to relearn they epochal crime and re-connect with the jewish culture that be so integral to they history , and this be apparent in most of the city and tourist/historical site .<ssssss>there be not attempt to whitewash or hide they past , though they approach sometimes seem too clinical , lack the depth of emotion that the enormity of the crime deserve .<ssssss>nonetheless , it be a warm experience , with so much to see and do that despite the cold we be constantly on the go .<ssssss>and do not forget the warm apple strudel , coffee mit schlag -lrb- with whip nonsugary cream -rrb- that cap every afternoon 's journey around 4 o'clock .<ssssss>so berlin be a great experience , and i would recommend to everyone a visit .<ssssss>but as for the hotel , let I start by note i be a big fan of marriott in general , but be not as pleased with they berlin offering .<ssssss>the hotel be modern , american style , in the best location 1 block from the u-bahn subway for potsdamer platz , connect with most of berlin .<ssssss>this location be in the dead zone of the berlin wall year ago , and a memorial remnant of the wall be there .<ssssss>the hotel have a unusual odor in the lobby which likely be relate to clean solvent or deodorant , but be sickenly sweet .<ssssss>a large atrium allow the odor to waft up to the upper floor where we be .<ssssss>breakfast be not include , so we do not eat at the restaurant except for one dinner which be average , moderately but not exquisitely pricey , even consider the euro at $ 1.56 .<ssssss>there be plenty of coffee shop to get a coffee and pastry/croissant in the morning .<ssssss>the bedding be not the usual new bedding see at other marriott , rather a pillowtop mattress cover over a standard , fairly lumpy mattress .<ssssss>way to soft and lead to back pain city .<ssssss>complaint to the front desk to change the mattress bring housekeeping who remove the pillowtop mattress cover only .<ssssss>not sufficient .<ssssss>room be average size , good view of construction in berlin , modern good bathroom .<ssssss>no flat screen tv be unusual for this age in a good 4-5 star hotel.internet access of 20 euro per day be outrageous - thank god there be a dunkin' donut 3 minute away with internet cafe access at 1 euro -lrb- not to mention the donut -rrb- .<ssssss>we leave after 6 night have have a wonderful though freezing trip , and with ache back from the bed .<ssssss>would i go back to the marriott again ?<ssssss>likely , because of location , location , location .<ssssss>
4 3 4 4 4 3 3 1		nice place but no internet ... we have a great weekend getaway plan and be look forward to we stay at the omnus .<ssssss>the valet parking be 51.00 / day but we be direct to a garage up the street for a weekend rate of 7/day .<ssssss>nice downtown location withing walk distance of shopping and dining .<ssssss>lobby and restaurant be very nice .<ssssss>my wife 's martini be $ 15 and my beer be about $ 7 .<ssssss>do not drink too much there .<ssssss>the room we have have a great king bed , super comfy .<ssssss>old style tv set look out of place but work fine .<ssssss>immaculate room and very nice appointment .<ssssss>we be disappoint that we in-room high speed internet do not work .<ssssss>call customer support 2x but no dice .<ssssss>mention it to the front desk people and they shrug it off as no big deal and do not offer to try to make it right for we .<ssssss>needless to say we do not get any work do in the evening but i guess that it be not mean to be .<ssssss>so all in all we have a good time at a upscale hotel with crappy internet service .<ssssss>

5 4 5 -1 5 -1 3 -1		a great place to enjoy a quiet holiday , or party @ sister hotel .<ssssss>we just return from we trip from april 8 to 15th , 2006 .<ssssss>we attend with 3 other couple , however we go down the second of 2 week , where the other 3 couple be down for 2 week .<ssssss>we all have a great time .<ssssss>here a synopsis.rooms : we be a super vip which give we a ocean view room .<ssssss>what a great view of both the pool and ocean .<ssssss>we have a second level unit .<ssssss>the room be clean and surprisingly not musty smell as i usually find and accept at these very humid county .<ssssss>the a/c work well , the room have a great bathroom , very clean , keep in mind , this resort be only 2 year old .<ssssss>the mini - bar be stock every day , with bottled water , sprite , coca-cola , and a beer , which be disgusting .<ssssss>we simply ask the maid to put in presidente in a bottle and it be do .<ssssss>that be a great beer , but be better bottled than on draught .<ssssss>we have vip and as such they change we towel twice a day with a nightly turn down service .<ssssss>it may not seem important but it be nice .<ssssss>the room be also big suite .<ssssss>another good vip feature be the beach towel be right in the room , and as such you do not need to get card to redeem they at the towel room .<ssssss>you do however have to exchange you towel as need at the towel room .<ssssss>at the end of you trip , you just leave the towel in the room and do not need return the card to the front , as oppose to trading in you towel to the towel room , get the card and return they upon you departure to the front desk.beach : what can i say , excellent .<ssssss>the bavaro beach be amongst the best i have ever see .<ssssss>also , no one be allow on you beach except pcp guest .<ssssss>this be not seemingly a important thing , until you go over to the princess caribe and princess tropical , -lrb- sister hotel -rrb- , and see how crowd they beach be .<ssssss>we have security constantly turn non guest away from the beach and property as a whole .<ssssss>it keep the pcp population quite low .<ssssss>also , we can go to the 2 sister hotel , but they can not come to the pcp.pools : only one large pool with a swim up bar .<ssssss>very nice and clean .<ssssss>this be because of the relatively low population at this resort compare with the sister hotels.grounds : one word , immaculate .<ssssss>all publice toilet be clean and new .<ssssss>the layout be small and you can walk from the beach to the front lobby in 5 minutes.lobby : small but quaint with a nice bar.bonus : you can use all facility at the sister hotel , and can take a tram at the pcp or just walk over , -lrb- 5 minute walk along the beach , or 15 minute if you do not take the tram from the front lobby of pcp .<ssssss>you will find the food selection better and sometimes tastier at the sister hotel , but the population at these hotel be significantly larger and be more crowded and it be a bit of a feeding frenzy as a result.buffet : basically good quality food for all meal , at the main buffet , especially the pasta bar , but you do get tire of it , which i find with most all-inclusive .<ssssss>very good deserts.ala-carte : we go to the tex-mex and i have the filet mignon 2x , -lrb- we go twice -rrb- , and it be delicious .<ssssss>we also go to the seafood , of which i be not a big fan and i have a excellent bonless chicken .<ssssss>the other have the seafood which be say to be good .<ssssss>both be on the pcp grounds , and one couple also go to the italian , which they love .<ssssss>there be other , but we do not attend.drinks : at the pcp , the base beer be presidente .<ssssss>as state earlier the bottled be better than the draught but both be good .<ssssss>for vip , they have bottled budweiser , and presidente .<ssssss>imho , the presidente be a better beer .<ssssss>at the sister hotel , they have miller high life and heineken in bottle , but not at pcp .<ssssss>i find this strange as the pcp be suppose to be a better class of hotel than the sister hotels.the rum be good , and there be very good rum drink .<ssssss>i recommend you try a tropical .<ssssss>most bartender can make it nicely , some can not do any better than pour beer , which be tough to screw up.for liquor .<ssssss>vip get you drambuie , frangelico , grand marnier , kaluha.this be a good trip , and if you be look for a very good resort , clean , this be it .<ssssss>i have also be at the occidental grand flamenco , princess bavaro in the last year and would recommend they all .<ssssss>-lrb- all on the bavaro beach . -rrb-<ssssss>i like the quiet of the pcp the best .<ssssss>
2 2 1 2 1 4 4 -1		not impressed my husband and i stay here last year to see the prologue of the tour of california .<ssssss>overall , this be a okay hotel , but there be definitely nicer hotel in the same area for the same price.i do feel like the picture on the website should be take with a grain of salt .<ssssss>we room be in the corner and be quite small .<ssssss>the room feel to we as if it have recently be flip but not very well .<ssssss>the paint job on the wall be sloppy and the carpet be in decent shape , but nothing i would walk around on without my shoe .<ssssss>the bathroom be the most disappointing as it look as if someone shove a plastic shower stall that be a size too small in the spot where the old shower stand .<ssssss>the area around the shower be grimy and not seal off properly .<ssssss>the door to the room also do not shut properly and have a huge gap on the bottom , let in cold air , loud street noise and ant - which we wake up to crawl all over a box of cookie my husband be eat the night before.overall , i would classify this as cheap , kinda dirty motel and would encourage people to look for better accommodation in the area .<ssssss>when we come back this year , we find a much better hotel that be extremely clean and just about the same price a few block down .<ssssss>i would not stay here again .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 5 2 1 2		poor service ... .<ssssss>please read the other review describe the poor service before decide to stay at this hotel .<ssssss>my new wife and i stay here for we honeymoon and the level of service be lack .<ssssss>we have read the review prior to book but figure that people be just be overly harsh -lrb- we generally be fairly easy go people and do not expect a lot -rrb- .<ssssss>we actual experience however mirror many of the prior post .<ssssss>a couple of highlight and lowlights.highlights : - hotel itself look very nice.-beautiful beach-all of the staff be very nice and sweet-we feel bad for many of they as it do not appear that they be treat very well by the management .<ssssss>when give the opportunity , most all of the staff member be quite helpful -lrb- it seem to be the management and hotel policy that be a detriment to service not the staff themselves . -rrb-<ssssss>lowlight : - in general not very accomodate .<ssssss>example : we be on we honeymoon and give a room with two double bed instead of a king size like we request .<ssssss>the desk manager refuse to switch we ... nuff said.-rule and schedule : i have never stay at a hotel that have so many rule and schedule .<ssssss>example : the pool close at 6pm and it be enforce strongly by security .<ssssss>man have to wear long pants at all of the restaurant for dinner include the buffet .<ssssss>- reservation : you need a reservation for everything -lrb- usually a day or two in advance -rrb- .<ssssss>this include all the dinner restaurant , massage , any of the beach activity and water sport , tennis , etc.-food : there be one or two restaurant that be excellent but in general the food be very bland and pretty much all taste the same.hope this help .<ssssss>

2 2 4 -1 3 -1 2 -1		not so good this hotel be not so good , the location be awful , it be sandwich on the road and there be just a tiny beach .<ssssss>we room face the street and be very loud .<ssssss>the pool be ok but i have see much better .<ssssss>the hotel have no happen spot - no disco , no lobby bar .<ssssss>the food be sooooo overpriced and one meal i have be so disgusting that i could not eat it .<ssssss>hotel down the road in isle verde be a much better choice .<ssssss>
4 -1 4 5 5 3 4 3		great location and price we have just return from a four-night stay at the hotel jazz , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone visit barcelona for a few days.we book we stay through the hotel and get a even better rate than be available on the website .<ssssss>the four night for we both cost about 510 euro , include the 7 % tax.the real selling point for the jazz be the location .<ssssss>it be between the place catalunya at the top of the rambla , and place universtat.the rambla be less than five minute walk away , and it be possible to walk most place .<ssssss>during we four day , we never use the metro , and only take a taxi once -lrb- in search of a restaurant that prove not to be worth the trek ! -rrb-<ssssss>we also use the open-top tour bus two day , and other than that we walk every where.there 's no need to pay 150 euro each for breakfast .<ssssss>we eat on two morning in a little bar/tapas place across the road -lrb- i think it be biere d'or -rrb- and other morning just pick little cafe off the ramblas - and about 10 euro should cover two people.we be on the very top floor , so we have no problem with noise - even even have a tiny balcony over-look the busy pelai street.the hotel bar be handy for a drink before go out , and we also use the internet there to check out restaurant review before we go out !<ssssss>it be not the kind of place where you would spend a entire evening , and it do not really stay open late enough for a nightcap , but for what it be it be fine.we have very little contact with reception , or staff in general .<ssssss>they be not exactly over-friendly - but they be efficient and as i have already say , for the price you could not do much better.we have lovely tapa on we last evening just around the corner from the hotel - come out of the hotel and turn right , and cross the street in front of you , turn right and then turn leave at the next junction - the restaurant should be on the corner ahead of you on you left .<ssssss>i think it be call dancerama or something like that .<ssssss>35 euro get we more plate of tapa than we could eat , ice-cream and two beers!but back to the jazz .<ssssss>for a city break where you be not go to be spend much time at the hotel , the jazz be perfect - spotlessly clean , comfortable , modern and well-priced.ps we even use the outdoor pool -lrb- yes , in november -rrb- and find out that they do not seem to bother heating it at this time of year ...<ssssss>
1 1 4 3 4 1 1 3		crap , at it be finest !<ssssss>... .<ssssss>this be my honeymoon - we request a quiet stay , so we be put on the ` serenity floor ' .<ssssss>.<ssssss>however , a few hour later , realize , the gym be above the serenity floor .<ssssss>we could hear people runnign on treadmill , which be pound through the ceiling .<ssssss>.<ssssss>and free weight be dropped.needless to say , we check out a few hour later .<ssssss>with no apology , and we take a taxi to the fairmount , which be great .<ssssss>what a crappy start to my honeymoon!ugh !!<ssssss>

3 3 4 4 4 3 5 1		great service , let down on the small thing third time we have stay here now .<ssssss>great location , service be a good as you would expect for this type of hotel - discrete , polite and prompt .<ssssss>very clean and comfortable.it get 3 star from I because it deliver what i expect from a world lead hotel.but , i almost give the hotel 2 star because of some little thing , for example : internet access be no longer free .<ssssss>this use to be complementary , but now they charge for it .<ssssss>not big thing i know , but it be one of the usp 's of this hotelthe fire in we room do not work .<ssssss>house keep be quick to come fix it , but she could not get it to work .<ssssss>we never hear from anyone else again about it and as far as i know it still do not work.you can listen to a wide variety of music through the tv from the hotel jukebox , but for Â£2 .99 per cd.the hotel seem to be lose the little thing which make it stand out from the competition and some of it feel like penny pinching .<ssssss>when stay in top class hotel -lrb- Â£400 + per night -rrb- i expect some of the service which the big chain charge for be include in the price .<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		great hotel , shame about the theive staff !<ssssss>we stay at the dylan for 3 night .<ssssss>on the face of it - not bad at all .<ssssss>nice little hotel , staff could have be bit more attentive but nice nonetheless .<ssssss>we room be very well decorate although it be a little small and there be nowehere near enough room to hang clothes - bit of a problem when there be no iron facility .<ssssss>hotel be very well located.we have a marvellous time , as we always do in amsterdam .<ssssss>the hotel be very pricey but it be a treat so who care .<ssssss>sadly we stay be ruin when we leave the hotel .<ssssss>i -lrb- stupidly -rrb- leave a bag full of duty-free cosmetic in the bathroom cupboard .<ssssss>with hindsight thank christ it be not jewellery .<ssssss>we check out mid-morning and leave we bag ready for collection later that day .<ssssss>i realise i would leave my goody and thought -lrb- as with every other half-way decent hotel -rrb- they would have be hand in by housekeeping .<ssssss>not so !<ssssss>i explain what have happen to the staff and they really could not have care less .<ssssss>there be no sincere apology and they do not see surprised or concerned at what i as say .<ssssss>they could not wait to get rid of I as they new victim be check in and hear my complaint .<ssssss>no resolution be offer - nothing ... and we have just spend a fortune at they hotel.i be disgusted and would not recommend this hotel to anybody .<ssssss>absolutely shameful !!!!<ssssss>
4 -1 5 4 5 2 2 5		very nice hotel !!!<ssssss>this hotel be located in a district which be not very nice but close to the interesting street .<ssssss>it be install in a typical building and room be also very typical.negativ item be : - one guy of the staff be not wery friendly , i use to be oblige to ask for a other one !!!<ssssss>- car park be very expensive $ 28 per day !!!<ssssss>- breakfast be no good at all without choice !!!<ssssss>positiv item be : - nice room !<ssssss>- clean - comfortable<ssssss>
1 1 2 1 1 4 -1 3		bad location and service the location of this hotel be too far away from central barcelona .<ssssss>we book it as it look like a nice boutique hotel with a pool at a great price ... but the cost and time to travel to port olimpic , plaza catalunya and las ramblas , for example , -lrb- 10-15 euro in taxi , 20 euro to top of diagonal/tres torre area -rrb- make it expensive .<ssssss>it would have be better to pay slightly more for a room in a central hotel .<ssssss>also if you get the hotel to book you a cab , there will be a callout charge already on the clock of 1.55 to 4 euros.the surround area be underdeveloped , quiet , industrial and not a pleasant walk -lrb- 10 min or so -rrb- to the metro and tram - definitely not at night .<ssssss>there be people live in shack on rooftop around and the general area do not feel secure.also , we have a problem in we room and it be handle really badly and rudely by the staff and not resolve .<ssssss>
2 4 2 5 4 4 4 3		disappointed at the westin .<ssssss>bathroom wall<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 4 -1 3 -1		do avoid !!<ssssss>really small room see some of the review we think , sound like a great hotel plus it centrally located ... well the only thing go for this hotel be its location , everything else be really terrible .<ssssss>the room be so tiny that you dont have any place to keep you luggage .<ssssss>dont even get I start on the bathroom .<ssssss>for the price that one pay for this hotel its no where near a 3 star ... the only positive point in the hotel be the free internet access which they have .<ssssss>we stay only for one night and next day we promptly check in to the citadine on las ramblas which be much more central , with fantastic facility and just a bit more expensive .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 5 5 5 5		great decor , but beware of the tiny bathroom !<ssssss>expensive , ultra trendy , but disappointing for the money.the clift be a boutique style hotel right in the heart of san francisco 's downtown art gallery district and within easy walk distance of union square , awesome art gallery and photo gallery and the nightclub and bar of the city.the major downfall be that the hotel bathroom at the clift hardly have enough room to swing a cat and for the price pay -lrb- around $ 300 per room per night -rrb- it be not all that great .<ssssss>i be impress with the lobby decor and the log fire in the foyer lounge area be comfortable and welcoming.great for location and trend , but not great for guest who wish to have spacious hotel room .<ssssss>
2 4 4 1 4 4 4 5		nice hotel , horrible location be here for a conference recently .<ssssss>the problem with this hotel be the location .<ssssss>market center be really not the center of anything .<ssssss>the hotel itself be nice , but there be no point in stay here as there be nothing around .<ssssss>the hotel offer a free shuttle service to the downtown area which help , but otherwise it be about a 10-15 $ cab ride .<ssssss>there be only two restaurant in the area - denny 's and buck 's prime -lrb- which be actually a good spot for bbq but they close early - around 8pm -rrb- and the hawaii spa which be dodgy to say the least .<ssssss>the hotel room be nice - standard fare .<ssssss>do not use the hotel restaurant or bar so can not comment on that .<ssssss>the conference room be better than average but they have a cricket infestation which seem to be a recur problem .<ssssss>the pool area look nice but i do not use it .<ssssss>if you be come to this hotel , i would reccommend rent a car .<ssssss>

-rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>we meet with we air canada vacation rep and if not for she , nothing would have get do .<ssssss>she set we up in a nice room -lrb- give I the room no . -rrb-<ssssss>and we be to come back at 3 and it would be ready .<ssssss>promise , promise .<ssssss>of course , when we return to the lobby at 3 no one know what we be talk about and i have to get we rep on the phone to straighten it out.i know i be go to come off as super picky ... but i be really not .<ssssss>i have stay in very rustic place in the philippine and thailand .<ssssss>but there be just so many issue with this resort .<ssssss>the beach be never clean -lrb- plastic cup and garbage lie everywhere -rrb- , the pool and grounds be not well keep nor clean , the food at the buffet be not good at all -lrb- the restaurant food much better ... and tip the guest service staff to get you reservation for every night ... it be well worth it . -rrb-<ssssss>but these thing do not ruin my vacation ... the worst be yet to come ... the ugly ... accord to all the story we hear from other traveler , theft be certainly a concern at this resort .<ssssss>even worse , i do not feel safe in my room at night .<ssssss>i come out of my bathroom at 1:30 in the am and find a hotel staff member and two other people in my room .<ssssss>have be give the key to at least two occupied room myself , i be not surprised but certainly not pleased .<ssssss>my husband have to barricade the door with a stool each night just so i could sleep .<ssssss>it be evident on a daily basis that we room be thoroughly search for cash or other item -lrb- my husband leave test item , hide around the room and they would be move -rrb- .<ssssss>on one occasion , when we return to we room in the afternoon , the slide door to the veranda have be leave open .<ssssss>on another occasion , when we drop off my sister-in-law at she room late one evening , she card key would not work .<ssssss>we be about to head up to the lobby yet again when a hotel staff member conveniently arrive with a replacement key .<ssssss>this seem very odd as it be about 1:30 in the am .<ssssss>we check the room and sure enough , some of she clothes have be place on the bed .<ssssss>go to bed at night and not feel safe in you own room be not a pleasant feeling.oh and do i mention the power outage that last for 8 hour .<ssssss>which also affect all the toilet as they run on pump .<ssssss>yike .<ssssss>bring a flashlight ... it be apparently common in the dr.the good ?<ssssss>hmmmm ... punta cana be apparently the area to go in the dr -lrb- vs. puerto plata -rrb- and the beach be beautiful -lrb- unfortunately it get dirtier and dirtier throughout the week . -rrb-<ssssss>while the front desk staff be not overly helpful , some of it be language and the rest be they be try to make the best of a resort where all the room have problem and all they hear be complaint all day .<ssssss>all in all , the people be very nice and friendly , especially at the bar where customer be generally have a good time and have no complaint .<ssssss>the resort be a good size and easy to navigate .<ssssss>if you be already book , just stay in a alcoholic stupor as we do and you will meet plenty of great people from canada and abroad and have a good time despite the resort.in conclusion ... i do not think we will go back to the dr. if we do , i will book at the bahia principe which i have hear from several people be good .<ssssss>the bavaro beach look nice too , when the bus drop people off there from the airport.our rep tell we to stay away from all the barcelo resort ... i just wish we have have know that beforehand .<ssssss>as my husband put itâ $ this resort be bush leagueâ?and i wouldnât recommend it to anyone .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 5 -1		not perfect , but still great i stay for one night at the ritz at the end of january for business .<ssssss>the location be great if you need to be near the central business district but close to the french quarter as well .<ssssss>the hotel have a bit of a odd layout , with the motor entrance one level below the lobby , and find the back door to get out to the french quarter can be tricky .<ssssss>the hotel interor be elegant and impeccably maintain .<ssssss>lovely flower .<ssssss>i do agree with another commenter about the overwhelming scent in the lobby -- it give I a bit of a headache .<ssssss>the good : friendly , professional service .<ssssss>the concierge be particularly helpful -- call galatoire 's for I , and walk I halfway there !<ssssss>the food and drink both for room service and in the bar/restaurant be great .<ssssss>the restaurant be interesting in that it tserve some of the best dish from famous n.o. restaurant , so you can eat all around town in one place.the bad : slightly understaff , definitely not up to ritz standard .<ssssss>it take a while for check-in because the front desk could have use a extra body .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 3 4 4 -1		dingy but great location i kind of have two review of the shawmut , because i stay here once for a romantic stay with my then-boyfriend in november of 2003 , and my friend end up stay there in august 2005 to attend my wedding to the same guy.so , the first thing i would say be -- if you long-distance romantic partner be come to visit , splurge on something nicer .<ssssss>i really could not afford more but i be live with my mom at the time and want some privacy , if you get my meaning .<ssssss>the room have huge water stain on the wall and ceiling , and the linen and drape be very dingy and dusty .<ssssss>so -- not a romantic setting.however , when my friend be stay there , i see it in a different light .<ssssss>it be a very affordable , basic place in a great boston location .<ssssss>the staff be helpful and breakfast be include .<ssssss>the room be really nothing special but if you just need a place to rest you head , the location and price can not be beat .<ssssss>you can walk to quincy market/fanueil hall , the north end , government center , downtown cross and the boston common .<ssssss>at the boston common .<ssssss>if you want to take a day trip to the pretty new england town on the north shore , north station be right there with all the commuter train .<ssssss>it also have local subway line into other part of the city .<ssssss>they really enjoy it stay there.my commute use to take I through that neighborhood and i can say it be not dangerous at all .<ssssss>there be homeless people everywhere in boston , except maybe back bay -- but you would have to sell you mother 's kidney to stay in back bay .<ssssss>so , in summary , this be not a pretty hotel but it will save you a lot of $ $ that can be better spend elsewhere .<ssssss>it be not romantic , it be practical .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 3 4 5 2		excellent i stay in this hotel for 4 day for a new year 's trip .<ssssss>the hotel 's location be really very convenient .<ssssss>it be not in a busy street , so it be not noisy during the night , but it be only about 10 minute walk away from the city centre , what be excellent indeed .<ssssss>we have a double-bedroom , which be small , but still large enough and very clean .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable .<ssssss>there be a large tv-set in the room and no mini-bar at all , but there be a large supermarket very , very close to the hotel , where you can buy drink .<ssssss>there be two machine with coffee and other drink in the lobby , but both be out of order .<ssssss>the bathroom be very small , but so cute , i like it very much , with a huge shower-cabin .<ssssss>there be no hair-drier available in the room , but you can borrow one at the reception-desk .<ssssss>breakfast be include and very good .<ssssss>hotel staff be very polite and helpful .<ssssss>the room and the bathroom be clean every morning and towel be change regularly.i would certainly recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 4 5 3 -1		combination of the bad and the good we just come back from a 7 day stay at the catalonia bavaro resort .<ssssss>overall , the trip be great , partially due to the company that we be in .<ssssss>- nice resort , could use some colour - service be not consistent , some people be very friendly while other seem to prefer spanish-speaking tourist more - room be nice but too many bug ... we come back with alot of ant bite - food be overall good .<ssssss>- the main buffet have a lot of variety but they seem to run out of the good stuff so quickly and wrap thing up too early .<ssssss>if you do not get there at 8 am , you probably end up have pastry and orange juice for breakfast .<ssssss>- a la cartes be decent , the rodeo restaurant be the best - pool be comparable to other 4.5 star + resort - cocktail be not that great , too sweet .<ssssss>capucinno at the lobby bar be fantastic though .<ssssss>- beach be nice but too much seaweed .<ssssss>before i leave i have read from trip advisor review that they would clean it up ... but not while we be there ... - nightly entertainment be ok , not the greatest - caution : we purchase a long distance phone service from the desk -lrb- prepaid type of service -rrb- and they disconnect we line before we use up we balance .<ssssss>we end up not have any phone line to even call we family member in the other room .<ssssss>they keep say they would send someone to fix it but it never happen .<ssssss>do not get we return from the balance either.overall , it be a nice resort for the price that we pay , however i would not return .<ssssss>i stay at the bahia principe resort earlier this year and be quite impressed with it , hence the return to punta cana .<ssssss>in comparison , bahia be much better .<ssssss>
4 3 4 -1 5 -1 2 -1		kinda glam , cool , some -lrb- unwarranted -rrb- attitude not in the tourist district , location be wonderful .<ssssss>embarcadero be fun pretty , lot of lunch option at ferry plaza , water water everywhere .<ssssss>people around all the time .<ssssss>farmer market @ ferry on weekend .<ssssss>about 3/4 mile to the convention center .<ssssss>1 mile of a lovely promenade walk to the wharf .<ssssss>fabulous view of bay bridge from the street front room -lrb- odd #s -rrb- .<ssssss>you can take the bart from the airport to the embarcadero stop -- 2 block walk!was thrill to see reception my room after the trek out from the east coast .<ssssss>the rainshower be refreshing relaxing .<ssssss>amenity be lovely generous -lrb- + other available for purchase -rrb- , bed extremely comfortable , excellent robe slipper .<ssssss>no street noise , despite be on the third floor above a very busy street .<ssssss>the little terrace on the 7th floor be excellent for a rose champagne wonderful cheese from across the street .<ssssss>very attentive housekeeping , know my exact preference after 1st day.cons : very small gym -lrb- noisy machine , try not to get one of those room nearby ! -rrb-<ssssss>; oddly limited room service menu from a restaurant with very extensive menu -lrb- i try to order to take up instead .<ssssss>odd reaction .<ssssss>when the food do come , ask staff for silverware , explain i be a guest - so they do not think i be steal fork .<ssssss>they almost do not let I out of the restaurant !<ssssss>they say it be policy - state no where - because room service be suppose to be exclusive .<ssssss>after explan not be intrigue by anything on the room menu , be really tired and promising not to do this again , they let I take my dinner -rrb- ; lighting in the closet area be very limited -lrb- forgive I , maybe some tap light ? -rrb-<ssssss>; reception desk very efficient but not welcome -lrb- compare to a sleek w hotel , where staff be as efficient + outstandingly friendly -rrb- ; if you be a tv person , location of the flat screen be akward - odd angel from bed right above the work station -lrb- could not have on for a noise distriction as it be right in you face -rrb- .<ssssss>i would return , this be a unique experience in a not-too-touristy area .<ssssss>the bar at the restaurant be hop , have a excellent $ 6 glass of pinot grigio .<ssssss>now that i know the rule , perhaps that will not cloud my impression.i review a number of sf restaurant .<ssssss>my fav be bluepointe .<ssssss>as for attraction , i love rent a bike -lrb- not too comfy -rrb- to explore golden gate park the ocean - outstanding .<ssssss>i hire another bike -lrb- more comfy -rrb- to bike over the bridge , which be so fun !<ssssss>

1 1 4 2 3 2 4 -1		go somewhere else .<ssssss>we regret choose this place for we honeymoon.we take a walk on the beach , past the hotel boundry and find what look -lrb- and smell -rrb- like raw sewage run into the water , fairly close to the hotel .<ssssss>that be a little alarming.part of the reason i choose this place be because they advertise that water sport be include in the price -lrb- like kayaking -rrb- .<ssssss>they only allow you to use the kayak for 15 minute one time , you have to pay for the rest .<ssssss>we be pretty upset about this , as we be expect to get some time to play , and be on a very limited budget -lrb- hence pick a all inclusive resort -rrb- .<ssssss>15 minute would not have be long enough to go anywhere.the food be really bad .<ssssss>the only food that be any good be the stuff we get on excursion , or the stuff the dominican 's eat .<ssssss>they have a lot of really bad version of american food , and we both get sick a couple of time .<ssssss>some of the food be okay , but the place that have decent food be always over crowd .<ssssss>we have to wait almost 3 hour to get into the little eatery on the beach , and the waiter be rude .<ssssss>we be fine with wait , but be basically ignore as soon as we get a table , and by that time we be pretty hungry.the room be clean and everything work , can not complain about that part .<ssssss>other tenant complain about never get towel and stuff , but i would tip the housecleaner and leave they little gift , which may have helpedthe employee be often rude , and trust I it be not we .<ssssss>i be constantly give they the cerveza from my room because we do not drink , and we go out of we way to be polite .<ssssss>i speak a little spanish and make a huge effort to speak they language , but they be still nasty.note : when we first arrive in the dr we be charge a entry tax , and tell there would be a exit tax .<ssssss>one family tell we about a friend they new that have major problem because they do not have enough to pay the whole family exit tax.some man grab we luggage , and because we do not have small bill on hand to tip , i try to take it back but they would not hand it over .<ssssss>i even ask the guy to give it back .<ssssss>they insist on haul we luggage and get really mad and yell when we could not tip they .<ssssss>we be annoyed because we do not have a lot of luggage and would have prefer to pull it - the really short distance - ourselves .<ssssss>we be really embarass , but do not want to give they a twenty for pull we luggage 20 feet.the whole time we just feel like people be try to bleed as much cash out of we as they could , and although tourist destination can be this way -lrb- i have be all over south america -rrb- , it be very stressful .<ssssss>the people act like they be completely entitle to we money , which drive I nut .<ssssss>there be not chiclet kid run around , but these resort overcharge -lrb- $ 5 for a small , lunch box size bag or dorito -rrb- for everything .<ssssss>it be almost impossible to find people to buy native stuff from that would actually need the money , which be part of why i like go to south america in the first place.i think we would have have a much better time if we have pick a better resort .<ssssss>it be not worth the money we save go cheaper .<ssssss>the vacation be not a very good memory at all.i do recommend the horseback ride trip .<ssssss>that be the only part i remember fondly .<ssssss>the guide give I they fasted horse and let I race he through the forest .<ssssss>can not do that in america !<ssssss>the food be also very good .<ssssss>have they serve that kind of stuff at the resort , i would have be thrill .<ssssss>

5 3 5 4 5 4 2 3		a cut above the norm i be a little sceptical at the rave review that this hotel get from trip advisor reviewer as they seem too good to be true .<ssssss>however , have stay there for two night in september 2007 , i would endorse the positive comment that have be write about langham place .<ssssss>the staff seem to go out of they way to be courteous and friendly .<ssssss>in particular , the concierge staff in the lobby be very helpful in provide information about diferent location in hong kong and how to get there .<ssssss>the room be beatifully furnished and equipped and be a cut above those of the average large hotel in this class .<ssssss>it be worth ask for a room with a view as some floor provide better view than other .<ssssss>my friend and i have book two room , one of which have stunning view while the view in the other be far less spectacular .<ssssss>the mezannine bar be very pleasant and reasonably price , at least during the early evening happy hour .<ssssss>room service be efficient and of a good standard .<ssssss>there be a swimming pool -lrb- and spa -rrb- on the top floor with great view over the city .<ssssss>it be a really pleasant place to go in the evening or early in the morning .<ssssss>the hotel be also in a great location within walk distance of the top end of nathan street and very close to the metro station .<ssssss>it be link physically to a shopping mall which mainly cater for a clientele of under 25 but have some good cheapish restaurant .<ssssss>the hotel be also within walk distance of the night market in temple street although much that be on sale be scarcely worth the effort .<ssssss>i have be in hong kong before about seven year ago and be surprise at how few bargain be to be have now .<ssssss>beij provide much better opportunity for the enthusiastic shopper !<ssssss>my only quibble with the hotel be that my room be not service until 4.00 pm which be very late .<ssssss>at 3.00 pm i ask at reception as well as the staff on the floor that it be do as soon as possible .<ssssss>i be , however , a little surprised that none of the staff seem to think it unusual that the room be not clean in the morning .<ssssss>it slightly spoil a good day in hong kong that i come back to find my room as i have leave it early in the morning .<ssssss>nonetheless , i would strongly recommend this hotel and will defintely stay there when i be back in hong kong .<ssssss>
4 3 5 5 -1 -1 3 5		great hotel , vera wang suite -- some problem though as far as i can see , no one have review the vera wang suite .<ssssss>this suite be very expensive , but it be really over the top .<ssssss>there be a few problem we encounter , though .<ssssss>they provide a chauffeur from the airport .<ssssss>.<ssssss>this be wonderful , he meet we right at the plane and whisk we off to the hotel .<ssssss>the manager on duty be wait curbside with a young assistant who be to accompany we to the room so we do not have to wait to check in at the desk .<ssssss>great deal ... we love it .<ssssss>however , from the hotel entry to this suite be a long , long way with two elevator to access it .<ssssss>for someone who do not mind be a long way from the lobby and like to walk .<ssssss>.<ssssss>it be great and secluded .<ssssss>the problem be , when we get to the room ... the key do not work !<ssssss>but it be only about a 10 minute wait and someone show up with a key .<ssssss>in the meantime we sit at a little desk in the vestibule and fill out the papers .<ssssss>the suite be outstanding with million of fresh flower and goody on the table , more than just fruit .<ssssss>the view be to die for as well as the accommodation .<ssssss>however , the suite have state of the art technology and the young lady do not know how to work it .<ssssss>.<ssssss>as do we !<ssssss>when we just could not turn the tv on , a maintenance man come and he find a old fashion hand control and tell we .<ssssss>.<ssssss>just use this !<ssssss>it work fine and we do not need all of the other stuff anyway.the toilet be wonderful !<ssssss>never think i would write about toilet -- but you simply walk up to they and the seat rise and when you sit down ... they be heated !<ssssss>wow !<ssssss>i want one for home .<ssssss>then in addition they have a wall control that wash you in any direction and then a dryer .<ssssss>just the cat 's meow !<ssssss>they also flush automatically and be quiet .<ssssss>the whirlpool tub be outstanding .<ssssss>work like a charm .<ssssss>only problem be that it have a mind of its own and go on every day at 2 pm and 4 pm , so no matter where you be ... you have to run in and turn it off .<ssssss>they refill pitcher of juice and ice tea daily .<ssssss>great perk .<ssssss>i also feel that perhaps the liquor be free of charge , but we do not drink that much , so we do not have any.the butler they advertise be non-existent .<ssssss>they do send a questionnaire and ask what hour we would want he and what we want he to do , and we just be not use to be that specific , so i guess they think we do not want one at all .<ssssss>i just could not have live with the thought of he sit in that little vestibule anyway , so maybe it be a good thing that we do not specify hours.room service be fantastic .<ssssss>we have breakfast every morning on the lanai and love it .<ssssss>each waiter be superb as be the food .<ssssss>this be include with the price of the room.as far as they maid service , it be definitely lack .<ssssss>they would leave dirty dish on the table and dirty glass out at night .<ssssss>this be something that might be a personal thing for I , but i do not want food sit around for more than 12 hour .<ssssss>i have to ask they to not do this .<ssssss>i also have to ask for the amenity , specifically the mouthwash to be replenished.there be a double door between the elevator and the room and each time that door be close we be lock out of the room .<ssssss>security say that they could not fix this and they would tell every one to leave it open , but that do not happen ... it get close and then we would have to call security and wait.we do ask the manager to just show we other room and as another reviewer have say , the other room be definitely date .<ssssss>they do state that they be go to do a cosmetic makeover start in october , 2008 and they definitely need it .<ssssss>we ask about book a specific room and be not happy when we be inform that even if we book it a year in advance , they do not guarantee it .<ssssss>this be a very formal hotel .<ssssss>la mer require a long sleeved shirt in the evening .<ssssss>for hawaius ... this be hot ... so we eat at orchid which be wonderful .<ssssss>man must have long pants for dinner .<ssssss>the employee be generally very pleasant and we be very surprised that they even give we beach chair for the little , charming , gray beach .<ssssss>each day for the evening turndown they leave a charming note on the pillow and a little gift to remember they by .<ssssss>i love this .<ssssss>each item be outstanding.i think i have touch on every subject and i hope this review be helpful to fellow traveler .<ssssss>

5 5 5 4 5 3 5 3		very nice all-suite resort this resort be a welcome surprise .<ssssss>it be beautiful 20 year ago when i be in college , so i be a bit concerned that it could be very wear down .<ssssss>to my surprise , it be in great shape .<ssssss>it be very obvious that the room have be refurbish .<ssssss>my wife love it and want to stay a couple extra night .<ssssss>the check-in go very smoothly even though they have a temporary front desk set-up because the lobby be get refurbished.the pool be great !<ssssss>there be a water slide for the kid .<ssssss>it be close when we be there , because it be cold out , but they have a sign in front of the slide say that you can ask the bartender to turn it on if you want to use it .<ssssss>i think that be pretty cool.you can drive and park in front of you room .<ssssss>if you get there in the day-time there be plenty of room-front parking , so you will not need the bellman to help you .<ssssss>if you arrive at night , get the bellman 's help !<ssssss>this be because the parking be very crow at night and you probably need to park away from you room and walk .<ssssss>i be there on a weekend and at night parking be very crowd .<ssssss>i guess you can take a drive to the room to see if you can find a good spot and return for help if it do not pan-out ... ??<ssssss>there be no short-term parking , so either there be a spot or there be not .<ssssss>the street be very narrow , so if you try to double park and unload , you will block the entire street.i will be go back for sure !<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 3 3 3 2		i will not go back .<ssssss>the hotel be undergo renovation during we stay and the elevator be often out of order or occupy by workman .<ssssss>this be rather annoying , but not we major complaint.the bed be very uncomfortable - after three night my husband and i be rather sore and sleep-deprived .<ssssss>we room share a door with the next room and we could clearly hear the guest beside we .<ssssss>the bathroom have shutter-style window that let in all of the street noise and cold air .<ssssss>this make for a chilly morning shower !<ssssss>the street noise also penetrate the room via the air conditioning unit place in the window .<ssssss>although the larskpur have reasonable rate and be in a good location we would never go back .<ssssss>

1 2 1 4 2 3 2 2		scary this be a aging hotel , with year of wear and tear evident in everything from the bathroom floor to the carpet.i be stay at the la quinta on business , have fly into mia and work nearby .<ssssss>the location be convenient for I as i have stay at a nearby hotel a few week prior.on checking in i be surprise to note that all room open to the outside .<ssssss>not a major issue for I , but maybe a little unnerving to someone with security issues.the choice on cable be limit at best -lrb- no fnc ... i hate it when fox news channel be censor -rrb- .<ssssss>bed sheet be well worn.i go to bed early and be awaken at 9:45 p.m. by someone opening my door with a key .<ssssss>this be one of those place where you have a actual key , not a key card .<ssssss>i yell and the person go away very quickly .<ssssss>when i tell the front desk what have happen , they say , oh , i be sorry .<ssssss>i will check with housekeeping and see what be go on .<ssssss>i be not the kind of person that need groveling , but the apology be on the order of what i would expect if they have be a little late with a extra set of towel .<ssssss>i never do hear what happen , and i will not be return .<ssssss>
4 5 4 -1 5 -1 3 -1		great place to stay in seattle great hotel .<ssssss>the room be really fun - not huge but certainly different and comfortable .<ssssss>we stay in a room with a shared bathroom but we never have to queue for one of they , even in the morning - in fact , we could take we pick and they be palatious and clean .<ssssss>do not worry about the noise either - we room be literally right over the cyclops bar and if you have the window open it be noisy but as soon as you shut the window it be pretty quiet .<ssssss>great location too - right in belltown so load of bar and restaurant nearby , 10 min walk from the space needle and in the other direction , 10 minute walk from downtown .<ssssss>great value place to stay in seattle , maybe not a place for the over 40s though .<ssssss>
1 -1 1 5 1 1 1 1		absolutely not worth the money !<ssssss>run away !<ssssss>soon as we pull up we know we do not want to stay there !<ssssss>first they do not have we confirmation from hotwire , and it take they 30 minute to get that.the hotel wa not inform of we confirmation despite that we be on the list for checkin .<ssssss>make sense to I too .<ssssss>after 30 minute of wait around and listen to the guy behind the counter yell at he son on the phone we finally get confirm .<ssssss>the also charge we a 100 dollar deposit , and fail to inform we of 40 dollar san juan tax.we then wait ten minute for they to find a room that be clean for we .<ssssss>once we get to the room , we be not thrill .<ssssss>the bed be huge be rockhard , my back be kill I after .<ssssss>the balcony be filthy and there be dust everywhere .<ssssss>neither of the lamp be plug in or have outlet behind the table .<ssssss>the ac have rust all over it , and drip water .<ssssss>the tv have really bad reception and we constantly have to hit it to get clear reception .<ssssss>the bathroom be really small , and the shower be disguist .<ssssss>we could not even look up at the ceiling because the brown rust be so disguisting look .<ssssss>the comforter have cigarette burn in it , and the closet have burn in it also .<ssssss>the toilet also clog around we 3 day and at that point we be ready to just give up .<ssssss>we also have no wireless and have to deal with go downstairs near the casino to get it .<ssssss>the restaurant be overprice and the poolside one be even worse with the rudeness .<ssssss>one woman directly steal my seat when i go to get up , and no one mind .<ssssss>i be not even finish eating !<ssssss>i could go on at how bad this place be , but i would not even have enough room .<ssssss>if the crackhead yell at 3am in the morning across the street do not top it then maybe everything else will .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 2 -1 4 -1		would not stay here again short and not-so-sweet : the room smell moldy and musty .<ssssss>the 2 elevator take forever and there be no available stairwell to use that be not a emergency exit .<ssssss>there be no service elevator so we have to share with the employee , who always seem to have huge cart fill the elevator space .<ssssss>the housekeeper come to we room at 9am want to clean it , we be not ready , and they never come back so we room be not clean .<ssssss>a guy walk thru the lobby sunday morning talk in a loud voice about the fact that he may have gonorrhea .<ssssss>this be a $ 60 -lrb- or less -rrb- a night hotel that we have to pay $ 119 plus tax a night for .<ssssss>the location be very industrial and not overly close to the main part of new orlean .<ssssss>but , on a more positive note , i will admit that the staff be very friendly .<ssssss>nevertheless , we still will not stay there again .<ssssss>
2 3 3 5 3 2 2 1		convenient location , old room and bad service by 1 single guy i stay at the dauphine orlean hotel because of the generally good review i read on orbitz , tripadvisor etc. the location be great , smack right in the middle of the french quarter , though the hotel be old and not gitzy , it be keep tidy and relatively clean .<ssssss>the french quarter 's know for its old building , so i take it in my stride when the bottom of the toilet 's crack and expose some weird colorations.the porter 's be friendly , manager 's be fine , but i have a bad experience with a young guy behind the desk .<ssssss>approach he for help to look up my delay flight time be meet with reluctance and eventually no help .<ssssss>it be very bad attitude and i wonder why he be there .<ssssss>
4 3 5 3 5 5 5 4		great for a few day the villa at doral be great for we family - 3 boy 9,11 and 13 while my husband be on business in miami .<ssssss>the accomodation be spacious and well equip , the pool be great for the kid and the staff very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>the boy have two golf lesson at the jim mclean golf school at doral at $ 208 a go , but to play golf , on the cheapest of the five course for 4 -lrb- plus dad -rrb- include club and a buggie would have be over $ 1000 .<ssssss>we do not !<ssssss>not a lot to do near doral other than golf and shopping and quite a way from the beach.we go on from here to hawk cay on duck key , florida key which be awesome in comparison probably because it be a real holiday resort , but if you have to be in miami , the villa at doral be cool .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 4 2 2 2		do not like the wiechmann hotel much .<ssssss>i stay one night at this hotel , in june 2007 .<ssssss>the physical facility be decent -lrb- as long as you be healthy enough , and have moderately size suitcase , so that the steep narrow staircase will not give you trouble . -rrb-<ssssss>but the service orientation be really lack .<ssssss>i pay 100 euro for my room , and neither the tv nor the wireless internet be work , not exactly what i expect for that price .<ssssss>when i go to check out , i ask the girl at the desk if these deficiency might merit some price reduction , she say no but she would call the owner to see what he say .<ssssss>he response be a big laugh .<ssssss>i tell she ok but point out that in this day and age with people post review of they hotel experience on the internet , i would feel obligated to inform people of both positive and negative aspect of my stay .<ssssss>i be be polite the whole time , as i be certainly not in a position to demand a reduce price -lrb- the hotel be in no way obligate -rrb- , i just want to see if they would want to give one to show that they recognize the deficience as not normal .<ssssss>nonetheless she immediate response be to say in a offended way , that sound like a threat!so if you would like to stay at a place where tripadvisor review be see as a threat , then the wiechmann hotel be the place for you ;--rrb- .<ssssss>otherwise , i would look elsewhere !<ssssss>
2 1 3 2 4 3 4 3		bali hyatt - could be anywhere in the world on arrival at the hotel the staff be very friendly .<ssssss>however , the hotel lack any sense of balinese culture and any traveller come from europe will find they have travel a long way to be somewhere that they could have find very much nearer home .<ssssss>despite travel in october there be lot of child at the hotel , and the bali hyatt be by no mean a relaxing option .<ssssss>i be glad i be not on a honeymoon or i would have be very disppointed .<ssssss>many people write seem to have stay in the regency room , which be indeed very much more private , but you pay for that privalege and unless you do that i would not recommend this hotel.one thing that get extremely noticable with the bali hyatt be the price charge by the hotel .<ssssss>most drink be over 5 time as much as you could pay if you walk down the road to a local shop , and the essence of this hotel be money money money , virtually nothing be include .<ssssss>even taxi price get hike up for the privalege of they order it for you .<ssssss>bali hyatt price be very similar to that of uk hotel , a far cry from what you read in the guide books.despite this it be a nice hotel with lovely garden , it be just not somewhere that i would advise any european jet setter to go to , bear in mind this hotel be cater for australian 's who see balus as the uk see the spanish costa 's .<ssssss>there be beautiful hotel nearby that appear to retain far more balinese culture than the bali hyatt , which have none .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 1 2 2 -1		nh doelen - good location nh doelen from the outside be lovely .<ssssss>the room be small and compact and we barely have room to move around .<ssssss>my boyfriend stay there for 3 night .<ssssss>i do not think the room be clean at all , find hair in the towel and in the bed on arrival.i personally would not recommend stay at this hotel until the cleaning policy have be review .<ssssss>the decor in the communal area be date .<ssssss>the only good thing go for it be the location , you can walk to most place without get on the tram or any other public transport .<ssssss>

5 5 4 -1 3 -1 5 -1		beautiful resort and friendly staff .<ssssss>my wife and i and we 4-year-old son stay at iberostar bavaro from feb 2 thru feb 9 , 2005 .<ssssss>the notably good thing : the staff be very friendly , helpful , energetic , and fond of child .<ssssss>we teach my son to say hola !<ssssss>and gracia , and the staff be delighted .<ssssss>the grounds be beautiful and impeccably maintain - peacock , egret , flamingo reside there .<ssssss>the beach be very wide , and there be plenty of palapa for shade - no need to stake one out at 7:00 be or risk a bad sun burn like at some other resort .<ssssss>the beach lounge chair be new and comfy .<ssssss>the food , while not gourmet , be above average for a all-inclusive .<ssssss>the specialty restaurant be good , esp the japanese and the steak house by the beach .<ssssss>the resort be quite large , as it ajoin the other iberostar -lrb- dominicus and punta cana -rrb- , the prime difference be the small 8-unit building in bavaro and the 4-storey hotel layout of the other two .<ssssss>the bad thing : my wife be not please with room cleanliness , but she be a bit of a neat freak .<ssssss>the kid ' mini-club be rather basic , but the kid ' staff be wonderful .<ssssss>look for casey and lollus if you use the mini-club .<ssssss>we feel comfortable with they because they will get to know you child -lrb- not just another charge for they -rrb- .<ssssss>my son use the club to meet other kid he age , and then play with they later at the beach , pool or in the early evening .<ssssss>actually , the only really disappointing thing , which have nothing to do with the iberostar , be the wind .<ssssss>in we week , we have one day of light breeze .<ssssss>the other day have enough wind to curtail the windsurfing , sailing and snorkel , and make the ocean very choppy .<ssssss>i swam in the pool every day and it be lovely .<ssssss>we first trip to punta cana in march 2004 prove similarly windy , and the staff at that resort say it be unusual .<ssssss>apparently not .<ssssss>if we do not return to iberostar bavaro , it will be only for the windy condition we find .<ssssss>the resort be wonderful , and i would encourage anyone to go .<ssssss>
3 1 3 -1 4 -1 3 -1		it be okay but you can probably do better .<ssssss>the hotel be conveniently located for sight-seeing , walk distance to las ramblas .<ssssss>it have a carpark but it be not on-site .<ssssss>the room be narrow mainly because of the clunky furniture and the window do not offer much light .<ssssss>for a four star and at those price , i would look elsewhere but if you be a business traveller , it be pretty standard .<ssssss>also close the window especially on friday and weekend night as the street outside can get rather noisy !<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 4 1 2 3		only okay , too much wait !<ssssss>we spend 7 day at this hotel , and after a few day , we want to change hotel .<ssssss>upon arrive at the hotel , we be tell we room be not ready and that they would give we a call as soon as the room actually be ready .<ssssss>hour pass , still no call .<ssssss>we come back , and they tell we the room be ready , but they offer no apology for not call .<ssssss>to irritate we further , we room come with free buffet breakfast voucher , which they refuse to honour because it ` be not in they documentation ' even though it be clearly state while book online on they official website .<ssssss>they only suggestion be to find some proof online and show it to they , but they would not cover the expensive internet charge there for do so.as for the deluxe pyrmont view room , it be generally modern and okay .<ssssss>however , the room do not have a particularly good view and it be not well light as the light be oddly place around the room .<ssssss>the bathroom have a bath/shower which be not comfortable and the toilet paper be attach to the wall only about 10-20 cm above the floor strangely enough .<ssssss>it be also worth note that the floor level of the deluxe room , which be apparently 16 , may not have actually be as high as 16 .<ssssss>floor 4 , 13 and 14 be simply miss and you could not access them.as for the rest of the 7-day stay there , we find the lift to be infuriatingly slow to arrive at many time , the concierge give we incorrect information and room service take over a hour to arrive at about 6 p.m. once .<ssssss>a warn to those stay with people under 18 or slightly above that age , the casino form a large part of that hotel .<ssssss>if you be under 18 , you will usually have to detour around the casino to get to the other side of the hotel rather than go through it .<ssssss>if you be slightly over 18 , you will constantly have to get you id check every time you take a shortcut through the casino .<ssssss>the only particularly good thing about the hotel that separate it from any other hotel of the same class be that it have good facility include a casino , restaurant and theatre .<ssssss>the location be also fairly decent , be located near darling harbour and have light rail and bus service beneath it.overall , however , we would not stay there again , we have stay at far better hotel in sydney .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 4 5 4 -1		so-so pro : great location , very clean facility , friendly and helpful staff , way above average breakfast buffet , air-conditioned roomscon : tiny-tiny room , those face the street be unbearably noisy at night ; thermostat in one of the room do not workbottom line : for 150 euro per night per double-room one can do better than this<ssssss>

2 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		good hotel miss some key element we arrive at the hotel vintage park mid-week a hour before check-in after fly cross country and be somewhat put off that there be no room available for we request -lrb- slightly -rrb- early check-in .<ssssss>the staff politely check to see if there would be any room available only after we press they on the point , and we be tell we could wait 15 minute for a room in the very small lobby .<ssssss>we do , but instead of the king room we request the front desk apologize that only a queen be available -lrb- this only 45 minute before official check-in mid-week - somewhat hard to believe -rrb- .<ssssss>imagine my surprise to find not a queen bed at all but a full size bed -lrb- we sleep on a queen at home , so i know the difference -rrb- .<ssssss>when i ask about it i be tell it be a queen and not offer a different room .<ssssss>also , contrary to some of the other review , it be most definitely not a tempur-pedic mattress , though it be a comfortable bed .<ssssss>the bathroom have no vent/fan , and the room be quite small , so everytime we shower the room become stuffy and humid -lrb- even after leave the window open and return after several hour , the ventilation be that bad -rrb- .<ssssss>the aveda product and free newspaper be appreciate , but offset by the expensive pay internet -lrb- $ 6/15 minute -rrb- and lack of coffee in the room -lrb- serve downstairs each morning -rrb- .<ssssss>the only real positive be the location , which be right in the middle of downtown , near the library , symphony , shop and restaurant .<ssssss>for the nearly $ 200/nt price , i would not stay here again .<ssssss>

2 1 3 -1 4 -1 2 -1		disappointing there be definate positive and negative to this hotel .<ssssss>overall i would not stay here again due to the cost and the lack of a comfortable atmosphere.i book two room and email the hotel in advance ask for room as close together as possible .<ssssss>they reply swiftly assure I that they have note we request and have arrange for two room very close together.on arrive they deny all knowledge of this and have allocate two room two floor apart !<ssssss>this cause no end of problem and one evening when my younger son want to pop up to see my older son , result in he be stick on a floor .<ssssss>they give you card that only allow you to go to the floor where you room be located which be good for personal safety but they give we additional card so that we could all go to both floor .<ssssss>however these card do not work properly and my poor 12 yr old son be stick on the top floor and get so worried that it do not cross he mind that he could go down the lobby .<ssssss>he make 3 call to reception and no-one offer he any help .<ssssss>finally he realise he might be able to go down , so get in the lift and go to reception .<ssssss>not one word of apology for the card not work properly and for they not give he any assistance .<ssssss>if any family be book here i would be very careful about be allocate different floor .<ssssss>and whatever age you child be , do not allow they to use the lift system on they own ... even if they be teenagers.on arrive one room be turn down and have fruit and a note from the manager welcome we , the other room have not be touch .<ssssss>a call to the manager ensure the arrival of someone to sort the room out.the safe also jam in one of the room but they do attend to this swiftly and apologised.the room be comfortable and the bathroom be really lovely .<ssssss>there be plenty of space to hang clothes but unfortunately only a coffee make machine in the room.we use quite a lot of the mini bar but find that we be not rip off by the prices.the other big let down be the lounge area .<ssssss>it take over 20 minute for I to get a small glass of red wine and there be only I and two other guest there!and then i be rip off by be charge 12 euro for a very small glass of wine .<ssssss>i do not notice until i get home because my husband pay the bill when he arrive back at the hotel.i find the hotel functional , but for the price have a distinct lack of customer focus .<ssssss>i guess they do not feel they need to make a effort.we use the lounge of the kempinski bristol which have a lovely blaze fire and soft sofas.i would not stay here again<ssssss>
3 2 4 5 4 2 2 -1		location - great .<ssssss>staff attitude - disappointing .<ssssss>we stay for 4 night at the marriott marquis time square for 4 night in dec 08 for a few day away for my grilfriend 's birthday .<ssssss>the hotel be ideally located right in the heart of time square - and you really feel like you be at the centre of the earth staying here .<ssssss>it be especially good for we as we be only stay in nyc for a few day and do not have a great deal of time to be find we bearing .<ssssss>with so much to see and do in nyc it be really good to be at the heart of it.the hotel be very impressive , a typically giant we hotel .<ssssss>however , the staff be very impersonal and on several occasion disappoint we .<ssssss>on reception they could be quite blunt if they be busy do something and you approach they .<ssssss>we have a problem on check in whereby they actually check we into a room where there be already some other people 's bag in the room !<ssssss>we go straight back downstairs and the lady correct the checkin and put we in another room , although the view be out the back of the hotel and not look onto time square as the previous one have be .<ssssss>i point out to the lady that have see the previous room we would like to see if she could find we one with a similar view , and she do .<ssssss>however , the next day we find that we new room have a leak in the bathroom ceiling cause by the torrential rain .<ssssss>we ask maintenance to come and take a look and leave they sort it out as we head out for the afternoon .<ssssss>i ask they to update reception as to whether we would need to move room .<ssssss>upon we return i ask the guy on reception what the outcome be and he quite abruptly just respond ' id please ' to look up we room detail .<ssssss>then without any conversation or explanation he simply start tap away on screen and hand we some new entry card for a new room - no explanation or apology offer , seemingly unaware that this would represent a inconvenience to we .<ssssss>as he have say practically nothing throughout the exchange i make a point of ask ` so we will need to change room then ? '<ssssss>, but he do not take this opportunity to apologise and simply say yes .<ssssss>so i then say , ` so we will need to move all we stuff then ? '<ssssss>at which point he realise we be not happy and offer to send some assistance .<ssssss>i tell he not to bother himself and walk off.overall i would say the location be excellent and the room generally pretty nice , and from what i gather a good size for nyc .<ssssss>for this reason , i would probably recommend the marriott marquis .<ssssss>however , we experience with the staff do not meet the expectation we have give the price of stay here , and do not go the extra mile when we have problem .<ssssss>
2 2 3 5 3 5 1 -1		great potential ... bad result what and up and down weekend ... my wife and i receive 2 night at the palladium punta cana as part of a wedding package offer by fiesta hotel .<ssssss>we arrive on friday night and be warmly greet by a very professional and courteous staff who make check in a breeze .<ssssss>we leave after work and arrive at the hotel at around 9:45 pm and be assure by the front desk supervisor that we have plenty of time to make it for dinner as long as we send we bag with the bellboy .<ssssss>much to we chagrin , when we arrive at the dinner area -lrb- about two minute away from the front desk -rrb- we be rudely tell by the hostess that if we be go to eat we would better hurry up because it be 5 minute to 10pm ... nevertheless we be let in to eat but be completely ignore by the server and have to get something to drink at the bar outside after we have finish we meal .<ssssss>on top of that we sheet and pillow do not smell good ... i could hardly sleep because of the smell that eminate from the sheet and pillow -lrb- this issue be correct the next day -rrb- day 2breakfast be good , nothing extraordinary -lrb- no smoke salmon for breakfast althought they do have it for dinner -rrb- but adequate .<ssssss>luckily juice be self serve at breakfast so we didnt have the same problem from the previous night .<ssssss>my wife and skip lunch because we spend most of the day at the beautiful beach which i must say be the best part of trip .<ssssss>we get hungry at around 4pm and head toward the pool side restaurant -lrb- el bohio i thing -rrb- food here be great and vary from burrito to brocollus and paella ... again , i be disappoint by the lack of self serve drink but at least i be send a waiter who promptly fulfil my drink request .<ssssss>dinner be at the main restaurant -lrb- el behique ?? -rrb-<ssssss>and again , the food be ok but we have to go to the bar outside to get a drink because the waiter would not go around we area and/or ignore we and everyone else around we .<ssssss>we have a great server at the outdoor lounge that be next to the restaurant.day3this be we final and worst overall day ... we get up at 9 and decide to get breakfast before head to the beach prior to check out and what be the first thing we see when we get to the breakfast area ??<ssssss>a line with about 50-70 people wait to get into the eating area .<ssssss>my wife and i didnt want to spend half a hour wait to get into the buffet area so we decide to check out the place where we have lunch the day before , when we get there 2 very nice gentleman inform we that they werent open for breakfast and that the only place that serve breakfast be the behique -lrb- place with the looong line -rrb- .<ssssss>we walk back to the place to find that the line have subside and that it be already 10:03 .<ssssss>when we try to go into the place to get some breakfast we lovely hostess carolina say we could not go in because it be already past 10 and that if we would have make the line we would have be eat inside my wife point out that the sweat on she forehead be because we be look for a alternate place to eat because we do not want to wait on line which do not seem to move carolina much .<ssssss>we end up go to another place that serve sandwich a la carte call la uva and find many other disgruntled guest .<ssssss>i end eat some fruit and yogurt -lrb- self serve -rrb- and a guy at a table next to we have wait so long for he food and be so disgusted by the wait that he end up raffle off he sandwich to the other poor soul that be desperately wait for they food .<ssssss>lunch be great at the bohio and again great variety chop suey , paella , meat , vegetable etc. all in all this hotel have the potential to be great -lrb- great sport facilite , beautiful pool , awesome beach -rrb- but it seem they be a bit understaffed because you have to wait a looong time for anything at most restaurant -lrb- especially drink -rrb- .<ssssss>i be not return here but you can check it out for yourself and hopefully you will be pleasantly surprised ... good luck !!<ssssss>

3 3 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		hilton berlin - it be fine ... we stay at the hilton for two night at the beginning of december .<ssssss>the hotel be well place in the city , with a u-bahn station right outside the door ; this make everywhere very easily accessible .<ssssss>we be also right next to one of the christmas market , which be handy .<ssssss>the hotel itself be fine ; it be a fairly typical four star hotel , without any feature to really set it apart from the rest .<ssssss>the lobby be grand in it be size , and be quite impressive .<ssssss>we be give a smoking room , and the staff be happy to move we to a less smelly non-smoking room when we ask .<ssssss>throughout the stay the hotel staff be all very helpful and polite , and of course all speak excellent english - as usual compound my misery at be uni-lingual !<ssssss>we room be clean and of a good size and the bathroom be very nice .<ssssss>the minibar be well stock and price at the usual ott rate !<ssssss>the swimming pool and gym be both excellent , although i still can not quite believe they charge 11 euro for a sauna ... breakfast be excellent , with a very good selection of food and very good service .<ssssss>the hotel restaurant look nice , but we do not try they .<ssssss>probably my main criticism with the hotel be it be size - the hotel be very big and somewhat impersonal .<ssssss>check out at 10.55 on sunday be not a good plan , as all six queue for reception be enormous - this could of course have be avoid by get up earlier or do express check out .<ssssss>the last time we stay in berlin -lrb- june -rrb- , we stay at the ritz carlton pay a similar price to the hilton ; on we next visit we will certainly go back to the ritz carlton , as it be that bit more special .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 3 3 -1		ok , but we would not go back we truly want to love this place , come home and write a review that say do not believe all the complaint , those people be spoil , misinform , etc. sadly , that be not the case .<ssssss>the beach at the bambu be awe-inspiring in its size and quality , and nearly enough to mask the property 's other sin .<ssssss>we know go in that the bed would be hard and the food would be so-so , and that sound acceptable when gaze at the sexy picture on the web from you own living room , but midway through a week-long vacation , you really do not want to dread you meal and you mattress .<ssssss>other lowlight : the fitness center be pathetic .<ssssss>the equipment be old and rust -- not mean to be use essentially outdoorsstaff be a mixed bag -- some be fun and engaging , other be indifferent -lrb- we minibar be restock once in the whole week -rrb- we see a giant cockroach on we wall and another on the dessert buffet .<ssssss>yum .<ssssss>the specialty restaurant be worse than the main dining room , despite have to reserve a spot prior to 7 a.m.we pay $ 2100 for 7 night for two adult , which be pretty reasonable , but by no means cheap .<ssssss>in retrospect , i wish we have spend the extra money for a better place .<ssssss>perhaps no all-inclusive have good food , but we have better at the riu cancun and gr solaris cancun .<ssssss>yes , you can have a perfectly acceptable vacation there , but if you be fly such a distance and spend a tidy sum , do you really want to leave with any regret ?<ssssss>

5 3 5 5 -1 -1 -1 -1		great for family we have actually stay at this hotel many , many time .<ssssss>the pool be fantasic for family , because there be a child 's pool , shallow and in the shade .<ssssss>the jacuzzi be large , can accomodate large party .<ssssss>the room be huge , nice if you be stay several day .<ssssss>the buffet breakfast be the best ... make to order omlette , fresh fruit , ton of meat/side dish .<ssssss>and every afternoon be cocktail ... free of charge !<ssssss>enjoy the pool and drink up !<ssssss>
4 4 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		certainly not another bland place this hotel offer character , not luxury , and if this be what you be after you will be satisfy .<ssssss>the room be a bit basic and the bathroom focus on the historical aspect of plumbing , but that be all within the theme of the place - and everything work !<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful , the location be both convenient for sightseeing and offer a glimpse into aspect of life you would otherwise miss .<ssssss>the rustic -lrb- ie , continental -rrb- breakfast be a welcome start to the day .<ssssss>

3 3 2 -1 3 -1 1 -1		i expect more ?<ssssss>not a bad place to stay , just not that great either .<ssssss>we love the beach and the pool but if you want to avoid crowd this be not the place to be .<ssssss>all the room be smoke room and although there be not a stale smell , there be a scent pipe in that can be a little overwhelming .<ssssss>we never do figure out what it be .<ssssss>ask for a room overlook the pool .<ssssss>avoid the street side , a1a be loud even at 3:00 am !<ssssss>my biggest complaint be after 3 call to guest service we never do receive any wash cloth !<ssssss>overall , it be ok but we probably would not stay here again .<ssssss>
1 1 4 1 4 1 1 -1		will not return we choose this hotel as it be near the airport and boast what we think be free airport transfers.after a 7 hr flight and a further 1hr clearing custom we just want to get to we hotel .<ssssss>we wait at we pick up point for 30 min .<ssssss>no pick up !<ssssss>after call the hotel we be tell we pick up would arrive in 55 min !<ssssss>bear in mind the hotel be just a 7min ride away .<ssssss>i do not think that be acceptable service .<ssssss>we take a taxi.we arrive and then have to queue for 30 min to check in.meals be good -lrb- see comment later -rrb- but there appear to be something wrong with the hotel a/c which seem to be at 14 degree , most guest be eat wear winter woolies.on the way back to the airport we be then charge $ 10 to transfer which we feel add insult to injury.after return home my spouse become very ill and have to be take to hospital for treatment .<ssssss>doctor be pretty sure it be cause by eat a meal which contain gluten .<ssssss>as my spouse have coeliac disease we specifically ask we waitress to point out which meal be gluten free .<ssssss>it appear either the waitress be wrong or the chef be not informed.needless to say we will never return to the hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 4 -1 3 -1 3 -1		a bit overated i be a little surprised by such high praise of this hotel .<ssssss>i would probably give it a 4 star if it be similar in price to the other hotel on the waikiki strip , but it be not .<ssssss>with that in mind it need to be compare with a higher quality hotel such as the halekulanus -lrb- or at least something in that ballpark -rrb- .<ssssss>when it be put side by side like that , it really be not a good buy for you money .<ssssss>most of the reveiw just keep rave about location , but seriously ... how big be this island ?<ssssss>my normal commute to work be about 45 minute so i do not mind go a little further out for better value .<ssssss>afterall , i do not typically run back and forth to a hotel if i be spend time in waikiki -lrb- do not know many people who do -rrb- .<ssssss>we spend some of time on the other side of the island and turtle bay resort be far superior to this one and at about 1/2 the price -lrb- you just have to deal with drive if you want to go to waikiki ... but it be much more relaxing than be in the city -rrb- .<ssssss>anyway for my money , i will try someplace else .<ssssss>

4 4 5 5 5 2 3 -1		very pretty hotel , gear for european a girl trip two of we in mid 40 's , we be accustom to almost anything live in ny suburb .<ssssss>so i want to give a honest review : we really do like the hotel , room be clean daily , in room fridge w/soda -lrb- pepsi , diet and 7-up stock daily -rrb- spotless super clean , of course the hotel be brand new .<ssssss>the food be good , different , we observe that the hotel guest be mainly from spain , thus the food be what you would be serve in spain , shrimp with head , lot of pork , great green olive , terrible desert all flan type .<ssssss>yuck .<ssssss>-lrb- except for the donut in the morning buffet they be great -rrb- a few morning i have room serivce bring up coffee and fresh bread .<ssssss>that be good !<ssssss>the coffee be really good and it be everywhere .<ssssss>you do need to make reservation for the restaurant but it never take more than 10 min wait .<ssssss>one good thing be we do not get sick .<ssssss>there be some top shelf liquor .<ssssss>stoley vodka , beefeater gin etc. oh yeah if you want something to eat after the buffet close at night forget it. , all they have be this ransacked sport bar with a glass door fridge with some sorry 1 slice ham sandwich paste with ketchup ?<ssssss>and mystery meat burger , with a do it yourself microwave -lrb- not worth the risk -rrb- .<ssssss>one thing that really shock I be the smoking , i would refer to it as a smoke fest .<ssssss>the spanish guest be big on smoking and be very rude to boot .<ssssss>in fact my friend who be bear in spain tell I not to let any one know she be spanish because of the behaivor of these european .<ssssss>culture shock !<ssssss>i have no idea that european be such rude people .<ssssss>never see any of they tip either !<ssssss>you would be eat dinner and they sit next to you blow smoke in you face .<ssssss>also not a hotel for kid , nothing for they to do , and if you do bring they fyi the floor be super slippery when wet , i witness quite a few fall , kid like to run beware they could really get injured.so if you can deal with nasty bad mannered guest , a the fact that the hotel close down at midnight , and have the same entertainment nightly ... the beach be beautiful and the pool be ok this may be the hotel for you .<ssssss>i do not think i would return to pc , too risky with the water situation , cancun be much nicer .<ssssss>
4 5 4 5 4 3 3 -1		great hotel we stay here one night when the not-so-grand majestic overbooked and bump we reservation .<ssssss>this hotel be beautiful and have a excellent location .<ssssss>highly recomm the roof top restaurant for a good american style breakfast .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 3 5 5 1		ehh first of all this be a pretty expensive place , but i guess you can expect that with any resort .<ssssss>what i do not expect be that the place be kinda in shabby condition ... crack wall , clog sink in we room , fridge that barely work ... it do not seem like they spend much of they budget on upkeep .<ssssss>i do not spring for the $ 150 massage , so i can not comment on that.the staff be friendly and attentive , so that always good .<ssssss>.<ssssss>mojito be expensive , so that kinda bad ... bottom line , i would say be that there be plenty of less expensive place to stay in vieque , so find one ... if you want to stay on vieque , but can not live without the resort atmosphere , then i guess this be the place for you ...<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 4 5 4 3		excelent location !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>view from my room<ssssss>
3 2 5 5 4 2 3 2		nice location ; poor value book this hotel for a family 60th anniversary celebration .<ssssss>very comfortable place for the parent , but then - they do not need to pull out they wallet .<ssssss>-lrb- restaurant offer two egg over easy for $ 22 , for example , and $ 14.95 internet access -rrb- although i like the location -lrb- easy to drive to , easy walk to site of interest , water taxi to logan airport off the back dock -rrb- , i be surprise at the lack of small convenience like no place to buy bottled water if you arrive after 10 p.m. , and the complimentary coffee service in the lobby always have empty carafe , with no one about to fill they .<ssssss>there be coffee two block away , but still - a place that book itself as 5-star joint really should attend detail that the humblest marriott courtyard provide as a matter of course.for future special occasion , i will look instead to place like the boston harbor hotel , where premium rate and location mean that no guest detail be leave unattended .<ssssss>
5 5 5 5 5 2 5 3		anonymous but have spacious room second time we stay here .<ssssss>the check-in staff we very cold to the point of be unfriendly but maybe she be have a off-day .<ssssss>the room be great and very spacious .<ssssss>this be a large and pretty anonymous kind of hotel but it be well located and be very nice .<ssssss>the concierge send we to a great , and reasonably price sushi restaurant call midori near the hotel .<ssssss>you have to queue for 30 minute but it be so worth it !<ssssss>

4 5 4 2 3 3 3 3		best value in hong kong we stay for a week at the harbour plaza north point , in january 2007 .<ssssss>we book a one bedroom suite and overall we experience be very positive.the hotel 's location be way out in the suburb on hong kong island .<ssssss>its immediate surroundings be mainly office building and there be very few shop nearby .<ssssss>however , its only a couple of minute ' walk from mtr quarry bay station , there be a local supermarket directly opposite and a cafe de coral -lrb- cheap meal -rrb- next to that .<ssssss>the hotel be 7 mtr stop from central , about 12 - 15 minute ' travel time.the one bedroom suite be fabulous value for money .<ssssss>it have a living/dining room , kitchenette , bedroom and generous bathroom .<ssssss>unusually for a hotel room , there be stack of cupboard space .<ssssss>the furnishings be quite tasteful , with the exception of a ghastly carpet pattern .<ssssss>please , hpnp , do yourselve a favour and upgrade this !<ssssss>the staff be always helpful .<ssssss>when we complain of a bad smell in we initial room , we be promptly move to a new room that be very satisfactory .<ssssss>we book we room for about we $ 138 per night .<ssssss>this have to be about the best value anywhere in hong kong.a tip : ignore the hotel laundry service .<ssssss>go down the side street on the way to the mtr , and there be two laundry down there .<ssssss>we use one of they and pay hk $ 23 for up to seven pound of laundry .<ssssss>down the same street you will find the most bakery that produce fantastic roll and bun that make a great breakfast , for absolute peanuts.we enjoy we stay at hpnp and will go there again , for sure !<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 3 -1		major investment need this be the first time that a tripadvisor recommendation have be off the mark .<ssssss>this hotel need a major refurbishment and some serious investment rather than cosmetic amateur tinkering .<ssssss>we stay 2 night and ask to be move the 2nd night .<ssssss>have we not be move to a better room -lrb- still not great -rrb- we would have move hotel .<ssssss>this be echo by other guest who also have to be move .<ssssss>we be tour california and this be the only hotel that be well below expectation , such that we would not recommend it or stay there again .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful but seem to experience request for room change frequently .<ssssss>they have a few room which be adequate and some which be not .<ssssss>even the adequate room still have flaw such as enamel peel from shower tray , bit of board cover up hole , stain on carpet .<ssssss>the staff be very helpful but that can not compensate for a basically inferior accommodation .<ssssss>i be not sure how this hotel make it to number 2 rating for la ???<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 1 5 -1 -1		great location , average hotel spend one night at the hyatt and , while i love the location , i be not so pleased with the hotel itself .<ssssss>i book a room on one of the business plan floor , think this might be a little nicer than average .<ssssss>my mistake .<ssssss>what i get be a room on a floor just like all the other , except i have to swipe my key card in the elevator to punch my floor 's button .<ssssss>before i arrive , the hotel send I a e-mail from the e-concierge offer a variety of service for free and for extra cost .<ssssss>i respond by ask for extra towel and the new york time , but get neither .<ssssss>the hotel be huge and build during the era of the giant interior courtyard -lrb- much like the marriott marquis in new york city -rrb- .<ssssss>the now-dated interior be dark and damp -lrb- a stream run through the lobby , which be probably the moisture source -rrb- .<ssssss>the corridor be narrow and dark .<ssssss>the room itself be a bit dated and the bathroom be small .<ssssss>mold be present on the seam between the tub and the wall .<ssssss>give the cost of the room , i expect better .<ssssss>
2 2 2 2 2 4 1 1		mediocre at best when i arrive there be a obnoxious drinking crowd at they bar whisper , an whilst at pool and jacuzzi , forget my bathing suit , but tightly wrap in a large towel become a security beach !<ssssss>i realize this be northern can , but lay off the prude victoreanism .<ssssss>report this to security san francisco police authority have become joke 's on you .<ssssss>lighen up , will ya.thanks for the hospitality .<ssssss>

1 3 4 4 3 1 1 -1		yuk .<ssssss>the main disappointment be the customer service - after arrive in the wee hour of the morning after long flight delay it be very unpleasant to wait on a line -lrb- at 3am ! -rrb-<ssssss>to check in with the sole counter person - she be inept and speak poor english at a whisper ... we be not show or even point to we room , and finally get a lounge van driver to point we in the right direction.this continue throughout we stay , staff be obviously bore , resentful or just die to get off work , we be make to feel like intruder rather than guest .<ssssss>another annoyance - petty charge for everything from coffee packet in the room -lrb- $ 3 ! -rrb-<ssssss>to beach chair rental -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- .<ssssss>just up the room charge and skip this nickle and dime stuff , huh?the hotel itself be just one spending opportunity - the village be just shops.the room be fine - spacious and clean - but we high floor look over the truck and bus loading dock and the back up beeping of both be very annoying and last all night and day .<ssssss>disappointing in general .<ssssss>
1 1 1 2 1 3 3 3		a 1-star at best i stay at this hotel as a last option for the bc national championship game .<ssssss>i usually have very low standard when it come to hotel - i believe in the old red roof inn commercial that all room look the same with the light off .<ssssss>however , this hotel really challenge this theory .<ssssss>there be blood stain on the mattress , no hot water , a bathroom that i do not think have be clean in a long time .<ssssss>i can not imagine a woman could find this hotel acceptable .<ssssss>for I , it serve a purpose - it have a bed and a bathroom .<ssssss>other than that , i would not stay there again .<ssssss>
4 5 4 3 4 3 3 2		2nd visit and still very very good value i be stay here for a second time and i still think it be good value for ny .<ssssss>the room be very large , not beautiful by european standard , but clean , in good condition , dark wood furniture and light wall , etc. the bathroom be also in good condition and clean with no sign of wear or tear .<ssssss>the room come equip with microwave , coffeemaker and fridge !<ssssss>all in very good condition .<ssssss>the hotel be quiet , apart from the occasional excited teenager in the hallway!the location be also good - there be lot of pleasant bar and restaurant on 8th and 9th avenue , and you can get away from too many tourists!i agree with a previous reviewer that the internet connection be rubbish in the hotel - they should do something about it !<ssssss>otherwise , though , a very pleasant place to be !<ssssss>

2 3 4 4 3 1 1 3		pleasant , but incompetent service the hotel property be very pretty and conveniently located on chartre street , but the service be lack .<ssssss>we have pay extra and book a room with a balcony/patio , but be extremely disappoint when we discover it be part of a shared patio and we view consist entirely of a gray wall .<ssssss>-lrb- it feel like a prison . -rrb-<ssssss>because the room also do not have a room safe or a mini bar , we contact the front desk and ask for a new room .<ssssss>finally , after 3 + hour of wait and promise of we will have you move soon , we get a room that have a nice window that overlook chartre .<ssssss>unfortunately , the bed 's feather pillow be so flat we telephone the front desk two time to request foam pillow .<ssssss>we be tell that they think they be out of foam because other guest have request additional one -lrb- i guess the flat pillow be all over the hotel -rrb- , but they would look for some and get back to we .<ssssss>-lrb- we be still wait on that return call . -rrb-<ssssss>luckily , they do get back to we when the shower handle fall off while water be pour out full-speed .<ssssss>arrrggg .<ssssss>at all time the staff be nice and pleasant , but they just do not seem to have it together .<ssssss>staff appear very disjointed , not know what be go on .<ssssss>case in point , during we four day stay , there be never anyone work at the front desk .<ssssss>we would go inside and wait and say hello , hello until someone would come from the back to assist .<ssssss>
2 2 5 5 3 1 2 2		can not believe this place be still in business first the positive .<ssssss>this be one of the most beautiful resort i have ever be too .<ssssss>now the rest .<ssssss>all food here carry a rediculous high price .<ssssss>be prepare to spend $ 1000s a week for a family of four just on food .<ssssss>if you rent a car you could go into town and eat but you can never bring anything back without be stop by security to check you bag or package .<ssssss>there be sign that state no outside food or drink .<ssssss>if you have be to a all inclusive resort in mexico be prepare for disappointment unless you have unlimited funds.i remember a beer be $ 6 and soda $ 4 .<ssssss>if any of the restaurant be open which usually they be not be prepare to spend about $ 50 per person for dinner without drink .<ssssss>lunch and breakfast be the biggest problem though .<ssssss>i have never spend $ 30 on lunch before just for a sandwich and drink.scan you bill on check out as we be find the staff be write a extra 1 in front of the tip amount we be write so tip end up be in the teens for a single beer.finally since there be so few people stay there in august i assume they be hurt for more business .<ssssss>you would think they would attempt to attract more repeat business but with the price they charge that be not go to happen .<ssssss>
4 4 2 5 3 3 2 -1		nice stay very convient place to stay .<ssssss>room be small , but comfortable .<ssssss>bathroom very small .<ssssss>the only closet in the room be a armoire , which have a broken hanging rod .<ssssss>the bellman say he would send someone to fix it .<ssssss>two day later still not fix .<ssssss>we have to hang we clothing on the coat hook .<ssssss>not very convenient.we do not eat in the hotel , but do have a drink in they small bar , which be pleasant .<ssssss>we do eat at a deli practically next door , which be very good , and a few door down be a mexican restaurant to die for.we arrive prior to the rest of we party .<ssssss>we be early for check-in .<ssssss>we have we luggage plus all the luggage for family join we from england .<ssssss>staff store all we luggage eagerly.two negative : 1 .<ssssss>we overhear the desk give totally inacurate information to other guest ask direction , and 2 .<ssssss>when we ask where we could find a notary they have not a clue what we be talk about .<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 2 3 3 -1		average hotel , great location check in 81 bencoolen and find that the picture post on the net be stretch and magnify and the room be actually cubby hole ; definitely not for a small family , despite ask they about it earlier .<ssssss>we be allocate what the reception staff tell we be one of the most spacious room , and be take aback when i discover we room actually face a closed courtyard and other room .<ssssss>the corridor be like little alleyway on a boat with people of the night in the corridor .<ssssss>apparently , they rent out room by the hour too -lrb- !!!! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>definitely not a place for a small family with child .<ssssss>decent accomodation can be get for the same rate or a few dollar more a few hundred metre away at the ymca -lrb- orchard road -rrb- or ywca -lrb- fort canning lodge -rrb- , where we do move to for the rest of we otherwise enjoyable stay .<ssssss>i must admit that 81 bencoolen be ideally located for tourist with accessibility to transport and plenty of good affordable shopping option ; also close to bugi street and orchard road .<ssssss>the staff at the hotel know that they be not really into provide a experience ; they be just what they claim to be : a affordable , budget tourist hotel .<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 4 -1 1 -1		cheap , cheap , cheap !<ssssss>i have stay in this hotel for one night only .<ssssss>the location be quite good , you can easily walk to sony centre and the underground station be really close.the price be really good -lrb- 53 euro -rrb- and the hotel itself be new and modern-looking .<ssssss>however , all the good thing finish here ... as soon as i arrive small , but unpleasant thing start to happen : during the reservation i have ask for a room on the high floor - the one i get be on 2th .<ssssss>i have ask for a non-smoking room - the one i get be on the smoking floor .<ssssss>as soon as you be get out of the elevator on you floor there be cloud of smoke fly around - that be a smoking floor indeed !<ssssss>the room itself be modern , but quite small and make with cheap-looking materials.quite functional and comfortable , however !<ssssss>the breakfast be very basic and the restaurant be really crowded.on the next morning i have to wait for 15 minute before i could check out - there be a huge queue at the deck .<ssssss>so , overally , the place have a good location , it be clean and cheap.if this be what you be look for - it be a good choice .<ssssss>but if you do appreciate some service , would like to relax away from hundred of scream teens and do prefer to have you breakfast in the morning not next to a group of italian , who think that the whole restaurant be interested in they private affair - stay away from this hotel ; - -rrb-<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 3 3 2 4		club room not worth the extra money stay at the holiday inn crowne plaza amsterdam near to the centraal station over the christmas weekend and book a club room however we get a rather small room -lrb- 331 -rrb- with two bed .<ssssss>two chair and table .<ssssss>to get into the mini bar you have to move one of the chair and two people could not move around the room at the same time .<ssssss>we have already book again for the follow new year weekend and ask that when we return could we have a larger room as again we have book the club room .<ssssss>the follow weekend we have a much larger room -lrb- 501 -rrb- again with two bed .<ssssss>however i would question the use of club room .<ssssss>you do get access to the 6th floor lounge with wine and beer , but i have stay at this hotel many time before in standard room , and once .<ssssss>.<ssssss>yes you may have guess one of the standard room i stay in be room 501 .<ssssss>so it seem to I that the term for club room be meaningless and any room can be designate as club and the extra benefit be access to the club lounge with wine and beer .<ssssss>so my advise be to book a standard room save yourself a fortune and go to the supermarket over the road and buy yourself a 6 pack and a bottle of wine .<ssssss>
3 3 5 5 5 3 3 3		room good as usual but service cold as usual stay here for two night ... because want to use all the coupn before it expire ... stay here in the deluxe suite ... there be only two here .<ssssss>.<ssssss>room as usual excellent big clean .<ssssss>.42 inch plasma bose surround speaker .<ssssss>.<ssssss>super thick soft slipper .<ssssss>.<ssssss>only in the suite ... the premier suite here only one there be , , , be not worth it ... it be bigger then the deluxe suite but how they place the thing in the room and the bed sofa and toilet make it look way smaller then the deluxe suite ... the premier suite have less place to walk in the suite and to enjoy it ... i would recomend deluxe suite or if you be in a budget then the deluxe harbour view room .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
4 4 4 2 5 2 4 5		great place , one service issue overall , we be happy with the room , and the price .<ssssss>it be clean , and pleasant .<ssssss>it be very well located .<ssssss>however , on the last day , as i be check out i be ask at the front desk whether to order a taxi to the airport .<ssssss>i say sure , and then he tell I he will order a city car rather than a taxi since it be slightly cheaper .<ssssss>when i ask how much , it turn out that the price be $ 5 more than a taxi i have catch in to the hotel .<ssssss>clearly , the guy have some deal go with the car firm .<ssssss>i say , no i want a taxi .<ssssss>at which stage , he dismiss I say -- oh just get one outside.i find this so needless , itâs not the money itâs the principle .<ssssss>i do not like be lie to , and it make a otherwise enjoyable stay disappointing .<ssssss>
1 1 2 4 2 3 2 1		choose something else we stay there just one night , do not book hotel in advance so rely on some tourist agency near train station and they book it for we .<ssssss>location be good , the hotel have some bad smell and it look pretty wear out inside , the room be very small , well , clean but you still feel like you be in a hostel .<ssssss>the bathroom be also very small and look old .<ssssss>in the morning we ask the guy -lrb- at the reception -rrb- if we can have breakfast 10-15 minute earlier breakfast time -lrb- we need to catch train -rrb- , i understand he be not oblige to say - yes .<ssssss>but he be so indifferent to we request and kind of rude .<ssssss>it be very unpleasant .<ssssss>do not waste you money !<ssssss>there be much better hotel in amsterdam .<ssssss>

5 4 5 3 5 5 4 3		beautiful compliment to a fun city i check out of the hotel pulitzer and into the amstel .<ssssss>and now i could breathe !<ssssss>a beautiful and clean hotel .<ssssss>the location be average .<ssssss>it be a taxi ride , a metro ride , or a 20 minute walk to anything nearby .<ssssss>but the room be spacious and large .<ssssss>the service from the staff be well above average .<ssssss>the concierge be helpful and knowledgeable and the front desk staff be one of the best i have every encountered.the only negative be the first night i order room service it take over 1 hour to arrive .<ssssss>however , the people be apologetic and explain they have a big party they be service that night .<ssssss>the breakfast be a bit weak also.overall , this must be one of the best in amsterdam .<ssssss>for the same price as the hotel pulitzer , the value do not compare !<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 3 2 3 -1		average hotel as a group of 4 , we originally book we stay with jayakarta in one of the apartment , once we check in we quickly ask to be move to the hotel part of the resort , the apartment be very run down , and about a 10 minute walk from the pool to the apartment !<ssssss>so we get upgrade to 2 pool view room , which we be more happy with , still a very standard hotel room .<ssssss>the 3 pool be nice and there be a spa as well which be nice to have some drink in after dark.the breakfast be very average , not much selection and most of the time not be re-stocked fast enough .<ssssss>it do take a while to get tea/coffee serve and i find the staff pretty rude at breakfast.all thing aside though , this hotel be at a very good price and it be right next door to a strip of restaurant and night spot which certainley serve they purpose , have dinner or drink at the place right next door at sunset , absolutely stunning !<ssssss>i most likely would come here again just for the fact its so very close to seminyak but we pay legian price !<ssssss>
4 4 5 5 5 2 3 5		love the penthouse we be on a work related trip in amsterdam and stay at this hotel .<ssssss>the location be ideal .<ssssss>rijksmuseum just next by and the tram station just around the corner .<ssssss>if you be not afraid to walk a bit the shopping street be just 20 minute away and there be lot to see on the way there .<ssssss>and great restaurant .<ssssss>i be fortunate to get a room all to myself .<ssssss>i stay in the sixth floor at the corner suite .<ssssss>a superb room , king size bed , two room , a huge bath room .<ssssss>the breakfest be also great and the staff reasonably nice .<ssssss>the hotel do deserve the four star !!<ssssss>
5 5 5 -1 5 -1 2 -1		good value excellent value for money .<ssssss>we book a single room for a relative for Â£99 through a website and later upgrade it to a double for we as we relative cancel .<ssssss>the first time we phone we be quote Â£50 to upgrade to a double but i call back a hour later , speak to someone else who offer the upgrade for Â£20 .<ssssss>hotel bill be incorrect and they overcharge we by Â£200 .<ssssss>however , this be a genuine mistake we think and we think the hotel be actually very good with the room furnish to a very high standard .<ssssss>recommend<ssssss>

2 2 1 5 1 2 2 1		good location but no comfort here .<ssssss>location spot on but as soon as you walk in , trawl those stair to reception at top of building you know it aint the place for a romantic week for two .<ssssss>to be fair the sheet where clean but that be it .<ssssss>it be the bare minimum you would put up with .<ssssss>its a bed for the night and let not hang around in the morning hotel .<ssssss>its cheap as chip and the old say ` you get what you pay for ' be spot on here .<ssssss>we take a chance and at Â£90 for two people for three night i have little room to moan .<ssssss>for that price in one of the best location in florence what do one expect .<ssssss>its acheap traveller hotel .<ssssss>don , t go stay for a treat .<ssssss>
1 3 4 1 4 3 3 2		hold hostage in the suburb we book in haste via internet as we need a room for the night before leave for home .<ssssss>unfortunately , i do not check the review or i would have come expect the experience .<ssssss>it begin with a late shuttle from the airport .<ssssss>when it do not come accord to schedule , i call the hotel to be tell they would be there in another 45 minute -lrb- we would already be wait forty minute -rrb- .<ssssss>my husband run inside to use the restroom and , to my surprise , the shuttle show up .<ssssss>it drive away just moment before he come back !<ssssss>luckily the second time the shuttle arrive earlier than the hotel have say - on schedule .<ssssss>once on the shuttle we note that although the ride to the hotel be free , the ride back to the airport be 5 euro .<ssssss>as we would expect to hop the shuttle back to the airport so we could take a train into the city , we be suddenly aware that the rate for we room -lrb- 108 euro -rrb- be not so reasonable .<ssssss>the hotel be in a industrial area 15 minute away from the airport with no service in the immediate area so the 5 euro charge to get back to the airport feel like we be hostage to the hotel.because i be a priority club member , we get a upgrade room .<ssssss>the room be very stylish -lrb- euro style -rrb- but the sofa be pull out into a bed - which mean that there be no floor space until we stow it away and lift the heavy coffee table back into the middle of the room from in front of the hotel door .<ssssss>what a strangely design hotel room !<ssssss>at first it look like we have two bathroom - the toilet be just inside the hotel door , separate from the sofa area by a large table/desk .<ssssss>the sit area be separate from the bed area by a very large room divider/tv stand .<ssssss>what look like a second bath area be a separate room for the shower and tub .<ssssss>that mean that if i need to use the toilet in the middle of the night , i have to maneuver from the bedroom all the way to the area by the doorway .<ssssss>internet connection be very expensive - as other here have note - 6 euro for one hour and 22 euro for 24 hour .<ssssss>this end my plan to go online and find a way into the city .<ssssss>at the front desk we ask for a map of the immediate area - they give we a tourist map of the central amsterdam area .<ssssss>that be of absolutely no use at all .<ssssss>my husband ask where the center of the local area be - and they point in a general direction .<ssssss>so we head off across a field in that general direction to find a way into the city .<ssssss>we find we way to a tram stop - twenty minute away , across a field , along a dike , up over a large canal , past a large apartment complex .<ssssss>we rely on dead reckoning - and we be pretty good because we travel a lot and have spend the last few day get around the netherland by bus so we could recognize the general area in which we be likely to find a stop .<ssssss>someone who be not such a experienced traveler would have a more difficult time.we find we way to the tram stop - the matterhorn which be the last stop on the # 1 tram .<ssssss>after a nice half-hour ride , we find ourselves in the central station .<ssssss>just a word to the wise - try to get into central amsterdam in time to find a restaurant before 10 p.m. we be a little bit late and spend a half hour search for one of the few restaurant that serve dinner late .<ssssss>with very slow service -lrb- although the food be great -rrb- , we barely make it back to the tram station in time for the last tram out at 12:15 a.m.the bed be very comfortable , the room be very quiet , and we sleep well .<ssssss>in the morning my husband get up to find a cup of coffee -lrb- complimentary in most hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>at that point he discover that breakfast be not include in the room rate but that it would be 20 euro each .<ssssss>as he only want coffee he have to talk with two different people before finally get two very small cup of coffee for 5 euro .<ssssss>as we leave the hotel on the shuttle we both feel like we would escape from imprisonment .<ssssss>that be the same feeling we have when hike across the field and dike to find the path to the tram .<ssssss>i leave relieved that i be no longer hostage and certain that next time i would take the time to check out the hotel on tripadvisor.com !<ssssss>

1 2 3 4 3 1 2 3		fair hotel , but they steal my money i have a very bad experience at this hotel .<ssssss>when i first get there , besides the awful treatment i be give at the front desk , i discover that to use the parking lot i would have to pay a extra 18 dollar a day -lrb- information that , of course , be not available at the website -rrb- .<ssssss>i be not sure if i would need the car for the whole duration of my stay -lrb- 6 day -rrb- , so i tell the lady that i would park on that day alone , and then figure out what to do .<ssssss>well , i decide to leave my car in the parking lot for two more day , and then return it to rental company .<ssssss>so , on this third day , i arrive at the front desk and tell i be take my car out , and that they should not charge I for the remain 3 day .<ssssss>the new lady , that be as rude as one can possibly be , tell I that everything be ok -lrb- and look I as if i be ask the dumbest thing in the world -rrb- .<ssssss>the last day come and ... surprise !<ssssss>they charge I the parking for the whole stay .<ssssss>and of course , only the manager could change my bill , and he be conveniently not there -lrb- this be thursday morning ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i have a flight to catch in less than two hour , so i reason with the lady at the front desk -lrb- the one from the check-in -rrb- and she tell I that if i leave such and such information with she the manager would be able to do fix everything afterwards .<ssssss>i do that , and after wait more than two week with no result , i try to call the manager .<ssssss>the two guy that be suppose to be in charge -lrb- mr. jay vadhar and mr. robert palmer -rrb- be never available , and when i finally reach one of they -lrb- jay -rrb- , he tell I nice and easy that it be a misunderstanding , that he would reimburse I and so on .<ssssss>silly I .<ssssss>month pass and i be still wait for my money .<ssssss>my call be always direct to the answering machine , and all my e-mail never get a response.so , give the fact that besides this one there be several other bad review about this hotel , if you be think on save money by choose a nice cheap hotel near the quarter , please think again .<ssssss>

4 4 4 5 3 2 2 -1		a bit quirky but a good place to stay i be worry about we stay at this hotel after read other review but actually it be absolutely fine.good thing : - location can not be beat , near forbid city , with nice shop just round the corner and real life close by - ` chinese style ' room be charmingly decorate - comfortable , clean ` chinese style ' room - free extra such as bottled water , toiletries , tea etc in room - not a bad western/chinese spread at breakfast with a chef create freshly fried egg etc - sofa in lobby and bar space to relax innot so good thing : - take age to check in -lrb- and out -rrb- - money change be very slow -lrb- but thorough -rrb- - do not have all the thing the website promise -lrb- not all room have safe or minibar and tv be just chinese -rrb- .<ssssss>none of this be a problem but do not rely on the website<ssssss>

3 1 3 -1 4 -1 3 -1		completely overrate i think this hotel be completely overrate and uncomfortable at best .<ssssss>i have visit sf many time and i usually stay at hotel monaco , right across the street from the clift .<ssssss>unfortunately for I this time around they do not have a availability so i decide to give the clift a try .<ssssss>i only stay a couple of night but i could not wait to get out of there .<ssssss>the room be so sparce and minimalist in design that it be uncomfortable .<ssssss>i could not figure out how to operate the light , the wall seem paper thin because i could here any movement or talk happen in the hallway and a ear-piercing alarm go off in the middle of the night and be not turn off for 30 minute at least .<ssssss>but let 's get back to the furnishing ; i truly be not impressed .<ssssss>it do not even look good .<ssssss>plastic cube that look like they come right out of ikea serve as nightstand .<ssssss>while i appreciate the spacious bathroom , the rack to hold item be a mile away from the sink , and with only 1 floor mat on a very large marble floor , i literally have to slide the mat everytime i step so i do not have to step on the icy cold tile .<ssssss>the the hotel uphold it be swanky reputation with the lounge but i be so turn off and uncomfortable there that i try to spend every moment posbbile away from it .<ssssss>everytime i step outside i look at the hotel monaco longingly .<ssssss>my recommendation : stay at the hotel monaco for a truly comfortable and relaxing time and perhaps visit the clift for a night at the lounge for drink .<ssssss>

3 4 3 5 4 2 2 -1		great location , not so great staff the hostal be very centrally located and the room be clean but can vary a lot in size .<ssssss>i reserve directly with the hostel by email -lrb- in spanish -rrb- two month in advance and confirm my booking two week before go , specify that i would like a room with a view of the square .<ssssss>however , we be put in a tiny room to the side of the hostal , overlook the road that be be dig up .<ssssss>although they say the next day we could move room , they change they mind after we have spend 30 min pack all we thing away in the morning , which be rather annoying .<ssssss>overall , it be good value though and the location make it worthwhile .<ssssss>
4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		it be a keeper !<ssssss>the hotel be perfect for we trip .<ssssss>far enough from the crowd to be quiet , but close enough to restaurant and my meeting to be convenient .<ssssss>staff be extremely courteous , room be clean -lrb- although small as other have observe -rrb- , view of the park and ocean be great .<ssssss>very relaxing , very reasonable .<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 3 4 2 4		great location , but slightly disappointing this westin hotel be located close to the monorail station and westlake center , a short walk from pike place .<ssssss>its a good location in a city that be easy to get around.the room be spacious with superb bed and well-equipped .<ssssss>however , the decor be slightly dated and the whole feel of the hotel be rather disappointing .<ssssss>the lift , lobby , corridor , and restaurant all need freshen up.breakfast be average , with a slightly disappointingly small choice at the buffet , and rather pushy staff overly try to persuade customer to choose the expensive a-la-carte options.i expect more for my money .<ssssss>
3 3 4 4 2 2 4 3		great ammenity , terrible booking process and check in , among other we go to agua for we honeymoon .<ssssss>while the ammenty be excellent and the room that we get be about 10 foot from the beach , we do have some issues.we book a package that include a private plunge pool that be part of we room .<ssssss>when we get there they say that the plunge pool be not work .<ssssss>after we be there a few day we realize that they have overbook the room .<ssssss>the plunge pool be one of the main reason we choose this place.we stay at the resort for 11 day .<ssssss>the restaurant do not change they menu ever and the basics certainly be not on the menu .<ssssss>for exmaple , for breakfast they have ton of salmon but no bagel ; and when ask they look at I like i have two heads.i must admit thought , that the resort itself be awsome !<ssssss>they give we a moonlight private dinner , which be really romantic .<ssssss>in addition , they do have special dinner on certian night and the amount of food that be servy be huge!other than the book issue , that we be still try to get a credit on , the resort be perfect .<ssssss>if you want activity think , i would go to excellence .<ssssss>agua be mean for realxation , and 11 day of relaxation be a little long .<ssssss>there be no activite -lrb- include water activite -rrb- so it be pretty much eating lay in the sun , eat more , play board game , and eat more .<ssssss>
3 5 4 4 3 3 2 3		amsterdam 's secret airport hotel for those want a cheap and easy schiphol stopover this be well worth consider .<ssssss>of all the ` airport ' hotel there be only three in the central schiphol area .<ssssss>to access any of the other you have to take a shuttle bus.this hotel be a five minute walk from amsterdam zuid station from which there be frequent train run the eight minute journey into schiphol central .<ssssss>i book this place because we have a 7am flight out so need to be in schiphol by 6 .<ssssss>in my case i set my alarm for 5.15 , leave the hotel at 5.35 , catch a train at 5.48 and be in the airport at 5.55 .<ssssss>this be faster and more convenient than pretty well any other ` airport ' hotel .<ssssss>at â ?<ssssss>9 for the night it also represent excellent value.whilst i do not spend a lot of time in it , my room be surprisingly spacious .<ssssss>it be a bit spartan in some respects .<ssssss>pretty well everything the room have to offer be contain in the integral bed/bathroom/sitting bar unit picture above .<ssssss>that say the bed be comfortable , there be a decent choice of tv programme and the shower be good.what it sorely miss be any kind of wake up alarm system .<ssssss>there be no phone in the room and you could not set anything via the tv .<ssssss>give its location and potential customer base this be , to my mind , a major oversight.given its location in a commercial area to the south of amsterdam i would not recommend this to anyone visit amsterdam as a tourist .<ssssss>the nearby artemis be a much better hotel and often have similar rate .<ssssss>even that , like this place , be a bit far out of the center of town.for those go in/out of schiphol or with business in amsterdam zuid/amstelveen it be well worth consider .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 3 -1 4 -1		the reef be sneaky we arrive with a reservation for a standard room .<ssssss>go to the room and turn right around .<ssssss>it be so small 2 people could not meet , the bathroom be the smallest i have ever see and when you open the window curtain you stare right into a blank wall , about 10 ft. away .<ssssss>i dont know if this be the way they get you to ask for a upgrade .<ssssss>well , i do and ask for ocean view .<ssssss>after some look they find it and tell I that it would be a additional $ 200 for a 7 day stay .<ssssss>that be ok , so i initial it .<ssssss>they assign we the penthouse on the 18th floor .<ssssss>great room and wonderful view .<ssssss>the surprise come at check-out time .<ssssss>the $ 200 be the charge per night , so i owe a additional $ 1400 .<ssssss>after some discussion with the manager she waltz around and finally drop it to $ 100/night .<ssssss>i do not ask for the penthouse , just a ocean front room .<ssssss>i feel that this be a bait and switch plan .<ssssss>give they the worst room in the house and then sock it to they .<ssssss>very unhappy .<ssssss>food be ok and not too expensive .<ssssss>the front bar be the best , live entertainment , friendly bar keep.advise : make sure you room be what you expect .<ssssss>standard room be nothing as explain .<ssssss>i will never return to this hotel again .<ssssss>

2 2 1 4 3 2 1 -1		good location , but quite shabby and overprice we want a hotel close to the rock as we be climb the bridge on we last night in sydney , but we do not want to be in the middle of the noise and nightlife , so we choose this one.it be fine , quiet and convenient , but we room be dark and dingey and somehow prison cell like as a result .<ssssss>we have a little kitchenette and a very utilitarian grey bathroom .<ssssss>it really be not a room you be go to spend any time in , which suit we fine but at the price , seem more than a bit of a rip off .<ssssss>the reception staff speak very poor english and be not especially helpful .<ssssss>we ask to borrow a plug adaptor , and have to pay a 20 dollar deposit !<ssssss>please !<ssssss>all in all , fine , and suit we purpose , but nothing great and definitely overprice .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 3 2 3 3		only ok for the money , it really be only so-so .<ssssss>love the location , and the boutique feel of this place .<ssssss>but the little thing that make it special just be not there .<ssssss>we be there 4 night .<ssssss>the furniture be pretty worn , a little stain , and some of the button on the couch be half off so the sharp steel part be stick out .<ssssss>no extra pillow or blanket in the room , and when we ask for they , blanket be spot .<ssssss>not especially nice staff and every day i go for coffee and the heavy door be too hard for I to open .<ssssss>there be nobody there to open it , and no automatic door .<ssssss>for the money , the barclay be a better bet .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 3 3 3 4		over rate , over price this hotel be over sell and over bill .<ssssss>it be not a five star hotel .<ssssss>i would give it three at the most.the bottom line be that if they charge three star price it would be a decent choice ... .<ssssss>however they do not .<ssssss>you pay way too much for what you get at this hotel.if you be go to singapore for shopping or clubbing , then the location be good .<ssssss>for business or regular touristing , the location be pretty crummy .<ssssss>very crowded area of the city .<ssssss>cab be tough to get .<ssssss>restaurant be expensive.you can do better , for sure.rooms be tiny .<ssssss>complimentary mini-bar be a joke -lrb- a few soda 's and two tiger beer -rrb- .<ssssss>gymnasium and pool area be awful .<ssssss>not what i expect from a asian five star hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 2 3 4 1		there be much better hotel in san francisco my husband and i spend two night at the sir franci drake this past weekend , he be a groomsman in a wedding and the reception be be hold at the hotel .<ssssss>i really do not want to stay at the hotel with the wedding party , have read the review on trip adviser and know that there be so many better hotel around union square that we have stay at before .<ssssss>we receive a discounted room rate of $ 149 per night for a ` deluxe king ' room , and pay a additional $ 45 per night for valet parking .<ssssss>i do not have a problem pay this kind of money for a hotel , as long as it be worth the price .<ssssss>i do not find this to be true for the sir franci drake.our ` deluxe king ' room be nothing more than a basic hotel room with a king size bed .<ssssss>the room be about 200 square foot , we be in # 712 .<ssssss>in fact , it seem smaller than usual because we have a bigger bed .<ssssss>the deco-style decor and furnishings , though not my taste , be colorful and tacky , but in good shape .<ssssss>as report in a earlier review , it be true that the one small window be so dirty that you could barely see out of it .<ssssss>the real problem that i have be with the bathroom .<ssssss>it be so incredibly small that my husband and i could not be in there together .<ssssss>i guess that i would have be able to overlook the small size of the bathroom have it not be so disgusting.the bathtub have stain on the bottom and huge crack all the way across the tile wall that be badly patch .<ssssss>there be mold and mildew on the ceiling and the surround wall .<ssssss>the ventilation duct be tape over so there be no air circulation in the bathroom , though keep the bathroon door open and blast the a/c help a little .<ssssss>the shower curtain have mold on it as well .<ssssss>the faucet in the sink constantly drip and the drain from the sink drip on the floor -lrb- the housekeeping staff leave a lovely washcloth there to absorb the water -rrb- .<ssssss>the wood threshold lead into the bathroom be loose and half rot -lrb- water damage ? -rrb-<ssssss>and we toilet seat be barely attach to the toilet .<ssssss>it be the worst bathroom i have ever see in a hotel .<ssssss>it be the consensus of other in the wedding party that there room be just as bad .<ssssss>luckily we do not have to spend much time in they .<ssssss>it be obvious that the bride and groom do not check out the room before book they reception at the hotel , there be no way that they would have choose this place for they guests.i do have only good thing to say about the catering/special event staff and the facility for the wedding reception .<ssssss>the room be beautiful and the food be excellent .<ssssss>if you be visit san francisco , do some research and you will find a much better place to stay with just as good of a location .<ssssss>my husband say he will listen to I next time about where we stay .<ssssss>: -rrb-<ssssss>

5 4 5 5 5 5 5 2		great location , luxury hotel , fab staff , go elsewhere for breakfast the hotel be perfect for sightseeing in sydney , we spend six night at the hotel but avoid breakfast which be expensive for the quality and choice you get .<ssssss>try rd 's down the road which be run by a couple from the uk who welcome tourist and happy to chat to you and offer a great choice of breakfast at a good price .<ssssss>the hotel overall have excellent staff - we room be always so clean and tidy and everyone we speak to be very helpful .<ssssss>check in be quick and easy and the concierge be the best we have ever have the pleasure to deal with .<ssssss>simon be particularly helpful and be always on hand to make recommendation from blue mountain tour to hairdresser !<ssssss>he always make sure we get a taxi and the driver be instruct carefully .<ssssss>be warn that not all taxi driver know where they be go !!<ssssss>overall a excellent stay in a five star hotel - my only criticism be the sharp price of phone call from the room and breakfast .<ssssss>
3 -1 5 5 4 3 1 -1		convenient to airport , but inconsiderate we only need a place to sleep for a overnight layover .<ssssss>the location be very convenient to lax , but find the shuttle bus be ridiculous .<ssssss>after 20 minute we hail a cab only to discover it be just a few block away .<ssssss>when we check in , we reiterate we request for a cot and be tell it would be there in 15 minute .<ssssss>a hour later , my daughter be fast asleep in we bed and we call down to cancel the cot .<ssssss>not a restful sleep at all.no one even bother to apologize for the inconvenience.one weird thing that happen be the elevator have a mind of they own .<ssssss>there be a guy trap on there with I who tell I he stay in this hotel a few time a year and the elevator have be flakey like that every time he do .<ssssss>

3 2 2 2 4 1 2 3		unfortunately just mediocre this time i be really look forward to my stay but end up quite underwhelm .<ssssss>i be actually write this from the hotel , where i be attend a conference .<ssssss>for $ 250/night , i would expect a room with a coffeemaker at the least , and enough space to move around without bump into thing .<ssssss>although the closet be huge , the bathroom be very tiny with literally no counter space .<ssssss>the bedroom be like a obstacle course , with the tv position to the side of the bed , force you to view it by crane you neck to the left .<ssssss>the only window in the room look across at a inner courtyard of the hotel where the ventilation system be located -lrb- i.e. , not in the least bit scenic , and the drape have to be keep close most of the time since it face other room . -rrb-<ssssss>the woman at the front desk during check-in ask whether i prefer a high or low floor and then put I on the second floor .<ssssss>i also ask to be located away from the elevator so she put I directly across from one .<ssssss>-lrb- all i can figure be that she be have a very bad day , but she make a horrible first impression for the hotel .<ssssss>she be not in the least bit pleasant . -rrb-<ssssss>the toiletries in the bathroom be good quality but it seem that toilet paper be be ration as i have to ask for a extra roll .<ssssss>i also do not receive my copy of the sunday time on sunday .<ssssss>normally this kind of stuff would be overlook by I , but it all start add up to a not entirely pleasant stay .<ssssss>the bed comfort be acceptable but not the best.the hotel be within walk distance to union square , but keep in mind that it be uphill the whole way back if you walk .<ssssss>the price in the hotel -lrb- from the mini-bar to room service to the restaurant -rrb- be all high , so it be worthwhile to check out the grocery and cafe nearby.since i be a president 's club member , the fitness center and internet be free of charge , so those be positive .<ssssss>the hotel be very ornate and interesting from a historical perspective and everything be well keep .<ssssss>from what i have hear , i would ask for a room in the tower vs. in the main building where i stay .<ssssss>bottom line : i would not stay here if i be pay the bill unless i get a much nicer room for the price .<ssssss>
1 3 -1 5 5 5 1 -1		they mess up we add-on , but apologize i be write this to help other tripadvisor user , not to grind any particular ax .<ssssss>i recommend not order any additional item through the hotel 's website , or if you do , call ahead to make sure they be follow through.my wife and i be stay at the casablanca for we tenth wedding anniversary , which the hotel know .<ssssss>when i book we stay , i order -lrb- as a surprise to my wife -rrb- add-on that the hotel offer on its website : a bottle of champagne , a bottle of red wine , and flower to be wait in we room for we arrival .<ssssss>the total price of the add-on be about $ 150 .<ssssss>the item be a no-show .<ssssss>they apologize when i point out the omission , and offer to make the champagne complimentary and deliver the flower the next day.we end up cancel we stay , so i will not comment on the hotel other than to say that everything else seem very nice , the location be fantastic for time square access , and the staff and management be genuinely upset that they have make the mistake , apologize many time .<ssssss>they try to make it right , and graciously agree to cancel we reservation.i believe that the casablanca hotel probably deserve all the great review it get on tripadvisor and i do not discourage anyone from book this hotel -lrb- except the add-on -rrb- .<ssssss>my overall experience be unquestionably terrible but i can easily see why everyone else have like it .<ssssss>i hope relate my experience be helpful to you , the tripadvisor user , if you be consider the add-on .<ssssss>
2 1 1 -1 4 -1 4 -1		definitely 2 star as a regular hotel stayer through business demand , i be not sure this be the hotel for I and my husband , give the picture on the internet .<ssssss>however the room rate -lrb- over Â£100 per night -rrb- and the rating and review on this site mean i book a double room for 2 day .<ssssss>the room be as picture on it be own internet site - basic .<ssssss>it be well located , clean and with staff who speak very good english with lot of travel information and free internet access .<ssssss>however , i be not happy with my choice .<ssssss>we move room as the first one be small , noisy and dark with a bathroom so small it be difficult to move round , and in ` complain ' we seem to upset the staff .<ssssss>we feel we be intrude at breakfast and look at other hotel option .<ssssss>it be difficult to find a good value hotel in florence but i would not recommend this one .<ssssss>it be be a year and i still feel compel to write this review and point out be be definitely a 2star despite the rave review on this site .<ssssss>
2 2 5 5 5 4 3 1		style over content i have just return from a 5-night stay at the vincci soho and while everything be superb on the surface , scratch a little deeper and it soon become clear this be not perhaps the 4-star , business-led hotel it purport to be.the room be really ultra clean , which i guess be all most people want as most of time be spend sightseeing or working .<ssssss>to that end , it be great - however do remember to take you miner 's lamp .<ssssss>trendy uplighter and spot be all very nice to look at and be very photogenic -lrb- the room be exactly as per the website and be use for fashion shoot during my stay -rrb- , however i always find that be able to see be a bonus !!<ssssss>the lack of window , very dark deco and motion-sensor light make the whole place feel very airless , particularly during the day.in summary , the room be clean , comfortable and stylish ... but very , very dark - and there be also very limited storage space , so do not take too many clothes !<ssssss>the bar area be really nice and clean and with furniture straight out of the local ikea.i have to say the staff be always , always polite and helpful ... however , that do not always translate into positive action .<ssssss>for three of the five day of my stay all room internet connection be down -lrb- not ideal when you need to work -rrb- .<ssssss>despite assurance of someone will come to fix it in 10 minute no-one arrive at all , and while staff be sympathetic to the problem , the problem be never resolve and instead they try to sell I a wireless token for a additional 15 euro -lrb- which be only work on the ground floor ! -rrb-<ssssss>which they think be entirely reasonable.likewise , problem with the bath in my room go unfixed , as do the hotel 's problem with its entire satellite network after a storm on the first night .<ssssss>and a package i ask the reception to courier sit on the front desk for a full day too.that say , other aspect be nothing short of brilliant .<ssssss>the breakfast , for example , be as good as any i have ever have - delicious , fresh fruit and traditional omlette be the highlight .<ssssss>ok , so it be not cheap at 15 euro , but if you be feel lazy it be ideal.try and eat out in the evening though - the restauarant in the evening be a painfully souless experience .<ssssss>you be much better off visit one of the excellent tapas bar about a three minute walk away.and when you do go out to eat ... stay late !<ssssss>not only be the atmosphere great , but you will not get a wink of sleep before 4am .<ssssss>i have read the trip advisor review before my stay and so ask for a quiet room ... and despite book it three week before my stay i get the trump card : first floor , over the entrance , and next to the lift !!<ssssss>previous review be spot on - spanish seem to be a really loud language at the best of time and , believe I , the sound of binman at stupid ` o ' clock really carries.but if location be you thing , then you will not go wrong here .<ssssss>anton martin metro station be two minute ' walk away - not that you need to take it often .<ssssss>madrid be not a big city and , especially if you like to see thing from different angle , it be a really comfortable and enjoyable walk.all in all , the vincci soho be clean and comfortable - although if you prefer practicality to fancy wallpaper , then this be not the place for you .<ssssss>
2 2 1 1 5 1 1 5		crappy hotel this hotel be not so good on almost all level .<ssssss>the buffet at terraza be just thaw , pre frozen food ... not fresh .<ssssss>yuck .<ssssss>the service : horrible .<ssssss>i have reserve the suite suitable for 6 people and then give my room to someone else then give I -lrb- without ask I first -rrb- a room suitable for 2 people .<ssssss>when i come back to the desk to explain it take almost 2 hour to correct the problem , which they say be now 3 room in the executive tower .<ssssss>but they do not mention that one room have a murphy bed with no blanket !<ssssss>ahh .<ssssss>the beach here be almost not swim worthy .<ssssss>it be black sand and cover in rock .<ssssss>the pool be way overcrowded .<ssssss>basically , if you want to stay in a hilton , stay at hilton caribe in san juan .<ssssss>everything be better there .<ssssss>
2 2 5 3 5 2 2 5		mostly good , a little bad this hotel have it be good and it be bad point : on the good side , every room have 46 inch flat screen in they , and the decor be outstanding , very different from any other hotel i have ever see .<ssssss>the website kind of over-exaggerate a little on the technological advance they be claim , there be no gallery kiosk you can order food from 24-7 , you can get food at any hour , but it be not freshly prepare as they claim , it be pre-portioned and cook almost fully , then heat the rest of the way when you want it , by the gallery host i.e the chick at the front desk .<ssssss>the waffle in the morning be to die for , however , really honestly , they be the best i have ever have .<ssssss>there be no hot tub , kind of bummer , cause the pool area be very nice .<ssssss>and if you be a smoker , do not even think about stay here , there be only one smoking room in the whole place , i think .<ssssss>i call before i make my reservation to verify that there would be one available during my stay , be tell there would be , i make the reservation , and when i arrive , i be put in a non smoking room .<ssssss>i leave three day early because of it , and i will not ever stay there again because of the way the front desk girl be about I leave early , very snooty and holier than thou .<ssssss>but it be a beautiful property , i will give it that .<ssssss>

1 1 5 -1 5 5 5 -1		very disappointing the main reason i choose this particular resort be the kid club , due to the activity they promote online , although the $ 75 per day per child -lrb- additional child be $ 65 per day -rrb- seem high .<ssssss>when the reality be that other than 15 minute spend feed iguanaâs , the child be keep inside make bead bracelet and painting picture framer while they adult supervisor surf the internet , this be a poor choice .<ssssss>the room be clean , and the staff very friendly , but balance that off be a unchanging menu -lrb- over a 10 day stay -rrb- , $ 10.50 drink -lrb- we go to a grocery store and buy a bottle for $ 12 , which last the remain 8 day -rrb- , and spa rate be double what i happily pay in comparable resort in mexico - $ 90 for a pedicure , and $ 140 for a massage.i be horribly disappointed and obviously , will not be return .<ssssss>
2 2 1 4 3 2 2 1		no way be this place worth 400 a night !<ssssss>so i be so excited to stay in what be state as a 4 star hotel after only be able to afford 2 or 3 star .<ssssss>wow be the sheraton boston a huge disappointment !<ssssss>thankfully i only pay 159 a night thru hotwire , cause its barely worth that price.i ask for the south tower ahead of time but be tell it be no longer available .<ssssss>the north tower be horrible .<ssssss>the carpet be old , the room be small and the bathroom have a huge crack in the ceiling .<ssssss>this hotel be really run down !!!!!!!<ssssss>, i can not beleive they charge about 400 a night for this place!on top of everything else they charge a dollar for everytime u make a local call from the phone in you room ... that be just pathetic!all it have go for it be its locationus would never stay here again !<ssssss>
4 4 3 -1 5 -1 5 -1		a little dated but great service my wife and i go to the caribe for we 20th wedding anniversary .<ssssss>we find the check in efficent -lrb- although they would not allow we to check in formally until after 4:00 - turn out to be 4:30 -rrb- and as a hh member they upgrade we immediately to the tower .<ssssss>over we week long visit we have several opportunite to request service and it be always deliver quickly and with a smile .<ssssss>we be make to feel special.as have be note in other review , the facility be a bit dated but we find the service level far in excess of we expectation and this more than make up for it.the only negitive i have be the restaurant .<ssssss>although the food be good and the service decent , the value for the price be not there .<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 3 2 3 -1		beware the basement room just get back from the ambassade hotel today .<ssssss>we book this hotel base on good review from trip advisor .<ssssss>however , there be a huge disparity between room in this hotel and you need to make sure you get on a good one .<ssssss>we arrive -lrb- very tired from travel -rrb- and be show to we room -lrb- room 60 -rrb- .<ssssss>it have its own entrance from the street and be just below street level .<ssssss>we be disappointed but decide not to make a fuss but instead get out and enjoy the city immediately.that night we could hardly sleep .<ssssss>the room be very hot and have no air conditioning .<ssssss>we try to leave the window open but have to close it because - be below street level - the noise outside be very loud .<ssssss>in the morning we ask for another room .<ssssss>we be move with no difficulty whatsoever which make I think that many people complain about this room .<ssssss>the second room we get -lrb- room 72 -rrb- be lovely .<ssssss>it be on the first floor overlook the canal and have air conditioning .<ssssss>it be great to be able to lie in bed and watch the boat go by on the canal .<ssssss>to make up for we dissatisfaction with the original room , we be offer complimentary breakfast .<ssssss>this be a very nice goodwill gesture because breakfast be expensive in the hotel.the hotel itself be in a excellent location and the standard of decor and cleanliness be very good .<ssssss>the staff be polite and helpful.despite the bad first day , i would still recommend this hotel but only on the basis that other traveller be aware that they need to be careful that they do not get a unsuitable room .<ssssss>also it might not suit people with limited mobility because many of the staircase be very steep , narrow and curved .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 1 1 4		if you do not like sleep this be the place for you !<ssssss>we visit this hotel for three night late in december -lrb- between christmas and new year -rrb- .<ssssss>when we check in we be pleasantly surprise as we have a $ 49 rate for a mystery hotel from bookit and the place look nice .<ssssss>overall it be a experience mix with very negative and rather positive experience - detail follow ... postive - amazing location -lrb- one block from bourbon and canal -rrb- !<ssssss>safe feeling section of town .<ssssss>right by the st.charles streetcar route .<ssssss>great free continental breakfast!first night : we be evacuate by a horrible alarm in the middle of the night due to a fire on the 7th floor -lrb- someone fall asleep smoking they say -rrb- , we finally get back in and go back to sleep to be wake up by housekeeping at 7:30 -lrb- there be not do not disturb sign available -rrb- - we decline they service , then the housekeeping supervisor call at 9am to make sure we really do not want housekeeping service , wake we up again .<ssssss>the place be so noisy !!!!<ssssss>the room two down have 11 people stay in it - we complain about the noise and the issue be not resolve .<ssssss>they obviously do not control the amount of people in the room - there be traveler for the sugar bowl arrive as we leave and there be numerous room that have a ton of people stay in them!other negative : we do not have we room clean the first two morning , but do on the third and they take all the linen and do not replace they .<ssssss>the bathroom door be in section -lrb- the bathroom be too small to have a regular door close since it be too close to the toilet -rrb- and make a awful screeching noise when you try to quietly close it in the middle of the night .<ssssss>the view out we window be of the other side of the building about 20 foot away .<ssssss>we key have to be reset four time since we keep be lock out when we return .<ssssss>the front desk staff be extremely slow , rather unhelpful and not effective - example : could not help we with direction , we do not get the wake-up call we place -lrb- two -rrb- , unable to resolve issue , etc. .<ssssss>.<ssssss>for the price we pay , it be ok .<ssssss>i would stay here again if there be a really cheap rate and we come with low expectation .<ssssss>if you want a more positive experience , i would pay a little more and try the hilton garden inn or hampton that be on the same block -lrb- i have have great experience with both of those -rrb- .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 2 1 2 -1		very disappointed this be we second stay in this hotel , so we feel that we know what to expect , but how it have go downhill in three years.the beach can not be fault , but more often than not the beach towel , which be provide by the hotel be not available and you have to wait up to two hour for clean one .<ssssss>seem unacceptable , as two of the hotel be close due to be late in the season so why be the towel not use from these close hotels.the hotel be absolutely overrun with local at the weekend -lrb- stay at a cheap rate -rrb- , who be very noisy and take over the place -lrb- apparently this happen all though october -rrb- .<ssssss>this also cause long queue for restaurant , bar and especially the takeway pizza , where they just grab at they while people who have order -lrb- non spanish speaker -rrb- be leave standing.the complex also have a convention centre , which hold a convention from 10-14 oct , cause a influx of teenager .<ssssss>again this cause lot of queue and noise , which security do nothing to alleviate .<ssssss>you be not inform of these convention when book , so they come as a complete surprise and a real nuisance.don ' t be tempt to do the trip to katalina island -lrb- describe as a trip to paradise , more like a trip to hell -rrb- .<ssssss>seven hour on a un-airconditioned minus bus to have two hour on a beach be bite alive by mosquitos.bedrooms clean and fairly well equiped , although sometimes we room be not clean until nearly 5pm .<ssssss>communal area look tired and in need of some attention .<ssssss>reception staff be quite unhelpful and not good english speakers.food and drink on the whole fairly good but it would be a advantage if you could speak spanish.very disappointed and sorry that we do not go elsewhere and just remember the first trip there with fond memory !<ssssss>
5 3 4 3 5 5 4 -1		a charming hotel we bedroom and bathroom be decorate beautifully and with care .<ssssss>it be peaceful and comfortable , if a little small .<ssssss>the hotel be friendly and charming , with helpful and welcome owner .<ssssss>there be the option to eat a simple , but decent , breakfast by the canal , which be very pleasant .<ssssss>we have a lovely stay and would certainly recommend this hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 2 4 3 1 1 1		a business hotel - not tourist friendly this be my first trip to san francisco and whilst the city be amazing the best thing about this hotel be its location.the room be very basic not even a fridge available .<ssssss>parking at the hotel be a crazy $ 39 per night .<ssssss>staff be as unhelpful as they could be begrudge any assistance require .<ssssss>there be no laundry facility so have to search san francisco for a laundrette .<ssssss>the business centre be never open to get internet acess.this hotel seem to be full of business traveller and be clearly set up for that market , so why do virgin holiday offer it to tourist within they package ?<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 3 -1 3 -1		overprice and one can do better i do not agree with the majority of the previous review for this hotel .<ssssss>we have a bad view but i suppose one could ask for a better view after see the room but my love one be too shy .<ssssss>the iron do not work and we lose electricity for a few minute in the morning which do not help my shaving.the bathroom be small and this hotel do not have hbo .<ssssss>if you like gigantic and drab hotel then this may be the hotel for you .<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 4 2 3 -1		little value for money stay at montcada in july 2008 with friend .<ssssss>location be fantastic and roof top bar be worth the visit .<ssssss>however , twin room be charmless and very small , bed be mildly comfortable ; i do not think that they deserve Â£100 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- ask per night per room -lrb- without breakfast -rrb- even in peak season .<ssssss>avoid room on via laietana as the avenue be very noisy .<ssssss>room on lower floor have a poor view , so ask for room on upper floors.staff be friendly but in some instance not helpful .<ssssss>free internet access be offer .<ssssss>

2 2 2 3 4 4 4 -1		disappoint with the lenox we be look forward to we stay after read the positive review on trip advisor .<ssssss>we book a deluxe room and on arrival we be show a room with peel wallpaper , marked skirt boards.after point out the description of a deluxe room to the manager we be offer another room which initially seem fine.however the view be of a department store roof service yard .<ssssss>there seem to be some sort of electrical engine run somewhere below we room , which could be hear throughout the night .<ssssss>on the final morning we be wake at 4:00 am by the waste disposal truck .<ssssss>when use the shower the whole room vibrate !<ssssss>no tea or coffee facility in the room , it be available in the hotel lobby in the morning.on a positive note the staff be very friendly and the location be good .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 3 4 2 -1		didnt wow I away we book a 1 night stay with the ritz carlton singapore to celebrate we 6th anniversary .<ssssss>want a surprise for my hubby , i also submit a online request for a complimentary cake .<ssssss>a couple of hour later , much to my delight , a ritz carlton personnel call I back to confirm my request and promise a cake will be present upon my check-in .<ssssss>on the day itself , the check-in process be a pleasant and speedy , without much hassle .<ssssss>most of my request be meet â?a high floor room , king size bed , non-smoking room and a early check in .<ssssss>the room be okay but i wasnât overwhelm or overly excite about the room .<ssssss>furthermore , there be a smell in the room â?it smell like fresh paint .<ssssss>i guess that management might have just refurnish or re-paint the room .<ssssss>however , i feel that the management should be sensitive enough not to use such room coz the smell can be real unpleasant.the swimming pool be nice and the service be ok .<ssssss>we often notice the staff change the towel on the chair to maintain the hygienic level in the pool .<ssssss>but the most disappointing part be the cake - i wonder how do the message convey to the kitchen â?somehow or rather , the wedding anniversary cake turn out to be a birthday cake with a happy birthday logo .<ssssss>i check repeatedly with the reception and they fail to give I a satisfactory answer .<ssssss>i also provide feedback to the management , but till date there be no reply from they yet .<ssssss>overall , the stay be okay but not the âWowâ?kind .<ssssss>
1 1 1 4 2 1 1 -1		awful nothing go right during my stay .<ssssss>only one elevator be in service .<ssssss>only one ice machine in the entire hotel , apparently , and it be out of service .<ssssss>i call staff about it and after a interminable wait they basically say it could not be repair .<ssssss>i ask the desk clerk if there be any way i could get ice ; she tell I i could go to the restaurant next door .<ssssss>i ask she if she be categorically tell I that the hotel could not provide I , a pay guest , something as basic as ice ; she say that be indeed the case .<ssssss>the room be small , dirty , loud , and uncomfortable .<ssssss>i will never return .<ssssss>
2 2 1 5 1 3 4 3		not my idea of a 4 star hotel good , central location but the room be depressingly small and dingy with no air conditioning .<ssssss>i find someone 's sock on the floor so clean standard be obviously poor .<ssssss>tea and coffee facility be provide in the room , as well as a safe but no minibar .<ssssss>good choice of tv programme .<ssssss>bathroom be fine .<ssssss>i have a evening meal in the expensive restaurant but the quality be not up to the price .<ssssss>good choice of buffet breakfast .<ssssss>i be only there for one night and certainly would not have want to stay longer .<ssssss>the hotel certainly do not warrant 4 star - i have stay in vastly better 3 star hotel .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 5 1 5 4		love the beach scene my girlfriend and i bring we 2 daughter and they friend age 18 .<ssssss>they have a fabulous time .<ssssss>we be worry there would not be enough young people there but that be not the case .<ssssss>it be a great spot for teenager .<ssssss>the disco be quite nice but for some reason it be pretty empty with the exception of new year eve .<ssssss>i do not know what people be complain about with the food .<ssssss>if you have ever be to cuba this would be a 6 star for food .<ssssss>the chicken be amazing everywhere , the steak be great and so be the full size lobster provide at the buffet .<ssssss>for a 4 star this be way more than we expect .<ssssss>i usually travel to 5 star hotel but since the girl be pay for they own trip we have to keep the cost down .<ssssss>the staff be great and i appreciate that they be constantly clean the grounds and the hallway .<ssssss>the beach be truly amazing and since there be no resort to the left of the hotel you could walk for mile and be pretty much alone .<ssssss>very romantic as we notice some couple take they towel to a secluded spot on this long beach .<ssssss>the only downside be check in as we room be not ready and issue with the beach towel .<ssssss>we get some but we girl do not till the 3d day .<ssssss>not sure what go on there but they do not really care .<ssssss>the room be a bit musty but you be by the ocean so its pretty much expect .<ssssss>we just open the slide door.there be no bug anywhere which be great .<ssssss>no mosquito or sand fly either .<ssssss>the water be fine and noone get sick .<ssssss>however i always make it a point not to eat salad on these vacation and generally have no problem .<ssssss>the layout of this hotel be great as you do not have to walk anywhere too far to get to you room or other part of the hotel .<ssssss>this be one of the reason we pick it .<ssssss>we meet people that have stay in the bahia principe which be a 5 star and they say this hotel be nicer .<ssssss>i would definately go back again .<ssssss>
4 5 3 5 3 5 5 3		very good we have just have a very good three night stay in the hotel , we be very happy with every aspect of the experience , from the initial contact and booking to the car parking and porter service.various people have praise the staff , i can only add to that praise , it be quite refreshing to visit a hotel that have staff that really care.the only minor grumble be that the shower in the room be fairly useless.we will use the hotel again .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 5 2 4 -1		a terrific hotel in a fab position the marco polo be on kowloon - the mainland - overlook hong kong island and right on the waterfront .<ssssss>make sure you ask for a harbour view room because the view be absolutely spectacular .<ssssss>it be also perfectly positioned right next to the star ferry terminal , so get across to hong kong take no time by ferry -lrb- the only way to do the cross ! -rrb-<ssssss>the hotel have all the amenity you would expect and we room be a good size , with plenty of storage and a functional if somewhat uninspiring bathroom -lrb- the shower be over the bath -rrb- and generous sink area -lrb- which be outside the bathroom -rrb- .<ssssss>but the bed be as hard as nail , so be warn !<ssssss>we eat in the buffet restaurant for breakfast and dinner one evening - lot of choice and all of it delicious .<ssssss>the hotel also link directly into a vast shopping centre , so it be dangerously easy to make and carry back you purchase !<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 3 1 1 -1		service can not get any worse !<ssssss>stay away !<ssssss>i go to florence with two friend and immediately upon we arrival and present the concierge -lrb- he name be martina capozza -rrb- with we passport , he tell we that he do not like american and america .<ssssss>that be just really awkward since we be he guest .<ssssss>he might as well just come out and say that he do not welcome we at he hotel.also , the hotel advertise itself as be locate in piazza indipendenza , a green and peaceful spot .<ssssss>piazza indipendenza be not a green and peaceful spot .<ssssss>we arrive at the donatello on 06/17/07 , a sunday , and see piazza indipendenza as a place full of homeless people sleep on the bench and on the grass .<ssssss>the whole piazza be also full of people sell junk -lrb- we see one man selling use surgical tool ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>i would not recommend walk around the piazza too late in the night.we stay in room 308 , which be located in another building !<ssssss>the wall be very thin so we hear everything that go on in the hallway .<ssssss>the hotel do not offer a safe free of charge .<ssssss>we would have have to pay 2 euro per day for its use -lrb- we choose not to use it -rrb- .<ssssss>when we passport be return to we , we be inform that we have to pay 12 euro to the hotel for make reservation for we to the accademia and uffizi .<ssssss>the hotel charge 2 euro per person per museum/gallery -lrb- 3 people ; 2 museums/galleries -rrb- .<ssssss>i email the hotel ask they to make the reservation for I .<ssssss>when the hotel respond that they will do it , they do not disclose to I that there will be this charge .<ssssss>when they confirm that they have make the reservation for I , they again do not disclose that there will be a charge .<ssssss>on top of that , each one of we have to pay another 3 euro to the museums/galleries for reserve ticket .<ssssss>so all in all , we pay 30 euro -lrb- 12 to donatello ; 9 to uffizi ; and 9 to accademia -rrb- for we reservation !!!<ssssss>on the day of we departure , we try to explain to the concierge that the fee be never disclose to we until we arrival .<ssssss>he just stare at we and tell we that it be they policy .<ssssss>do not you think that if it be they policy , it should be clearly and plainly state somewhere in write ?<ssssss>i finally tell my boyfriend to just pay it even though i do not think we should be charge for it .<ssssss>the concierge respond say that he do a favor for we and that it cost $ 100 per hour for my people .<ssssss>i refuse to believe that it he people get pay 100 euro per hour .<ssssss>the accademia be just a 5-minute walk from the hotel .<ssssss>and if it be a favor , should not it be free ?<ssssss>if it be a service , then it should be disclose prior to we arrival .<ssssss>and to add to this awful awful experience , the concierge pull out the f word on we .<ssssss>that be just plain bad business.furthermore , mr. capozza make a mistake with we reservation .<ssssss>he email I prior to we arrival and inform I that we have reservation to the accademia on 6/17 and to the uffizi on 6/19 when in fact , we reservation for the accademia be on 6/19 and we reservation for the uffizi be on 6/17 .<ssssss>we do not have any problem get into the accademia , but when we go to the uffizi , they be not happy that we get the date mix up .<ssssss>my boyfriend have to plead with the ticket office lady to ask she to make a exception for we .<ssssss>she let we into the uffizi , but give we a attitude and tell we to be more careful with the date .<ssssss>well , we show up on the wrong day because we rely on the hotel confirmation email!we eat breakfast only on the morning of we departure from the hotel .<ssssss>the dining room be tiny !<ssssss>i be a small person -lrb- 5 ' 1 ; 120 lb . -rrb-<ssssss>and i feel really cramp in there .<ssssss>the table and chair be literally touching each other .<ssssss>as for the food , it be way below average .<ssssss>the breakfast consist on some fruit , bread , very thinly slice ham and cheese , jam , butter , and hard croissant and danish .<ssssss>coffee and cappuccino be dispense from a machine .<ssssss>breakfast be from 7:30 to 9:30 -lrb- the hotel we stay at in rome and venice both have breakfast from 7 to 10 -rrb- .<ssssss>the air conditioning and light in the room require that you put in you key card in order to keep they on .<ssssss>we go in june , so it be pretty hot and it would be nice to come back to we hotel room at the end of the day to find it cool .<ssssss>here a trick to fix the problem : put a cardstock weight/type of paper in the slot and the ac and light will stay on all day .<ssssss>-lrb- i be sure the hotel be not happy with this but i pay food money for my room , so i want it to be cool when i return to it . -rrb-<ssssss>we stay in a triple , which consist of 3 twin-sized bed and we own bathroom .<ssssss>the quality of the bed and bathroom be acceptable for a 3-star hotel.overally , this hotel cause we a lot of grievance and upset we in so many way .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 3 3 2 1		expensive and only payback be proximity to park stay in a ` ordinary ' room at the disneyland hotel .<ssssss>i note that the other review on this site have mostly stay in the far more expensive suite and have have better experience .<ssssss>we have a room for 5 .<ssssss>only 3 small drawer and no bedside table on one side of bed .<ssssss>room service be horrendously expensive - Â£34 for a cheeseburger and pot of tea !<ssssss>-lrb- they do not provide kettle/fridge etc -rrb- no english disney channel on tv just cnn and bbc world so nothing at all for kid to watch .<ssssss>the main -lrb- only -rrb- advantage be the fact that you be so close to the park entrance that you can drop back to the hotel for lunch/dinner etc and do not have to stay in the park all day .<ssssss>you get a hour earlie access in the morning but oinly a handful of ride be open then so not as good as it sound !<ssssss>the pool be tiny - too deep for child and indoors - the pool at the newport bay be far superior.overall not sure its worth the extra money - hotel itself be pretty but the room not as big or as nice as newport bay .<ssssss>alcohol cost a fortune Â£5 for a 33cl bottle of beer !<ssssss>internet access be Â£16 a hour as well .<ssssss>stay here if money be no object !<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 2 4 2 -1		not so bad , but not so good ... you need to look past the hotel 's slightly fade decor to appreciate the comfortable bed and spectacular view .<ssssss>the staff be friendly , if not always particularly efficient , and we find the hotel to be wonderfully located - less than a five min walk from the empire state and less than ten from grand central and the chrysler building .<ssssss>we 24th room floor do not look out to the empire or the chrysler , but we do have a wonderful dual view of east river and lex .<ssssss>i be , however , a little doubtful of the cleanliness ; although the bedding and bathroom be clean , the kitchenette look somewhat neglect and we have to wipe down the counter top ourselves - not great.mini-bar and sundry be outrageously expensive and not worth it .<ssssss>pop to the market on the corner and stock up before you use anything there !<ssssss>also have to second the murray hill diner ; gorgeous breakfast and very reasonably price .<ssssss>we do not eat at the bark dog , but do take in a drink there .<ssssss>we would stay again , but more for the location that the hotel itself .<ssssss>

1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 5 -1		not a good place for non-smoker when my husband and i be discuss ther merit of differenct place we have stay , this be we benchmark of icky .<ssssss>we book a non-smoking room .<ssssss>when we check in there be actually visible smoke issue from the vent in the bathroom .<ssssss>we be adjacent to a smoking room and the circulation system ensure that all room be smoke room .<ssssss>we be offer another room , same problem and then rebook into the aston waikiki beach just a few block down the same street , which be fine .<ssssss>the staff be very nice about it , and i get the impression this be a common problem .<ssssss>this hotel cater to smoker and have a elderly air circulation system .<ssssss>if you be not prepare to accept a seriously smoky environment , do not stay here .<ssssss>room be tiny and bathroom tinier .<ssssss>i be 5 ' 0 and my husband be 5 ' 6 , so we usually never even notice the height of the shower .<ssssss>i think that be the first shower we have ever see that be too short for we .<ssssss>i have a overall impression of dirtiness , which to be fair be probably influence by the overwhelming smell of tobacco .<ssssss>since we be just down the street , we walk by often and notice many people party on the balcony , sort of a college dorm atmosphere with lot and lot of cigarette , so if that be you cup of tea , you might be please by this place .<ssssss>the location be excellent , but the cigarette smoke be beyond belief .<ssssss>

2 3 1 5 1 3 2 3		local say , ` choose something else ' as local , we rarely get a chance to stay in waikiki and play tourist .<ssssss>i have always want to stay at the pink hotel because it be such as famous landmark.the grounds and public space be gorgeous and awe inspiring of the true old hawaiian way .<ssssss>at first blush , everything look great.then you notice that it be not a true 5 star property .<ssssss>it be a solid 3 star property , because of the beach access , and grand public areas.it fall short of a 5 star hotel because thestaff will point to where you will go , not take you there .<ssssss>they act like they be important , but really can not make the decision to make small adjustment .<ssssss>-lrb- for instance , i ask about a late check out time the day before , and be tell to call in the morning .<ssssss>i get the feel the reception desk just could not be bother .<ssssss>my promise coconut grove room turn out to be over the motor court , or as the front desk correct I , porte cochere .<ssssss>the second room they give I be wedge in between the administrative office and overlook the landscaperâs maintenance area .<ssssss>finally , after personally consult the guest relation manager , i be give the promise coconut grove room.the furnishings be a bit worn and shabby .<ssssss>light bulb be weak , small bathroom , with no counter space .<ssssss>table and flatware be a bit dirty , staff clothing be not crisp and clean -lrb- especially at the mai-tai bar restaurant -rrb- .<ssssss>and the overall look be that it need a good facelift and cleaning.save you money , stay at a different starwood property and you can still enjoy this hotel .<ssssss>the room charge be interchangeable.even better , go to the halekalanus for a true resort , first class experience .<ssssss>

2 3 4 5 4 2 2 -1		i have have better ... .<ssssss>my husband and i stay at the edenh from may 9-12 , 2008 .<ssssss>i book this as a last minute trip to celebrate we anniversary/new baby/graduate school graduation , and it be recommend by we travel agent.the one great thing about this resort be its proximity to the airport .<ssssss>we have be to mexico and jamaica , and we bus ride to the resort have be up near 2 hour long .<ssssss>we do not want this on this trip since we be only there for 3 night , so be close to the airport be a real plus .<ssssss>we be the first stop off of the apple bus , and be on the beach within 6 hour of leave ohio .<ssssss>upon check in , the staff be in a rush to check we in , even though there be only one other person ahead of we .<ssssss>they throw a check in sheet at we to fill out with no comments/explainations .<ssssss>not the greatest greeting i have ever have at a all inclusive resort , but we be still excite to be there , and do not think much of it .<ssssss>we be also not offer the pink bracelet vip upgrade , so not sure if we look a certain way , maybe they think they be not go to make money off of we or something .<ssssss>the bellhop be extermely helpful though .<ssssss>we room be not ready when we get there at noon , so he show we a change room in the front of the hotel where we could change and get ready to hit the beach while they hold we bag .<ssssss>very nice set up .<ssssss>the beach and pool be both very nice and clean .<ssssss>we have no problem get chair and umbrella .<ssssss>only complaint about the pool umbrella be that they be very cheap and keep breaking and fall over .<ssssss>could probably use new one already , and they be not very old .<ssssss>the outdoor buffet be just mediocre .<ssssss>the food variety do not change much daily , and the hamburger and hot dog have a strange consistency .<ssssss>i know its hard to cook for so many people with such diverse background , but still be not great .<ssssss>the sit down restaurant be very good -lrb- we go to the steakhouse and the italian -rrb- , however , the wait staff be terrible .<ssssss>we be seat right away , but we server do not come to greet we for at least 15 minute and be very unfriendly .<ssssss>once they take we order , the food come out fast , but we have a hard time get silverware and refill on we water .<ssssss>i keep feeling like we be the red-headed step childen on the resort .<ssssss>maybe it be the fact we do not speak spanish , and we very obviously look like midwesterner .<ssssss>have the same problem at the bar , we would stand there and wait for a drink , and other guest would get serve first even though we be wait first .<ssssss>and they would never make eye contact or make conversation with we even think we try .<ssssss>not really sure what that be about ... we room be very nice and large .<ssssss>we have a first floor face out to the other resort , which be fine by I since all we do be sleep there .<ssssss>only a few mosquito to complain about , but nothing we could not keep under control .<ssssss>minibar be stock daily , and room be very clean .<ssssss>the front desk be also not very helpful in provide guest information on the activity on the resort .<ssssss>we would have like to know when we check in that there be a pig roast on the beach the first night .<ssssss>we walk to the buffet , only to be tell the buffet be on the beach that night .<ssssss>and there be firework the one night we miss b/c we never know they be happen .<ssssss>we also do not know they be show a movie in the courtyard , maybe more for the kid , but i would have a least be give the option .<ssssss>we do not know there be a show at 9pm most night -lrb- maybe all night , i never find out the answer -rrb- .<ssssss>we try to go to guest service for a activity calendar , but they refer we to the apple girl , who refer we to the front desk , who tell we they do not have they , and then we just give up .<ssssss>one other annoying thing be the people on the beach try to sell you stuff .<ssssss>i be in the water not even face the beach and a girl be yell hey over and over again at I to get I to buy picture .<ssssss>other boy walk up and down the beach try to see if we like to party and would not leave you alone .<ssssss>i be actually sleep on a chair the one time , and a guy wake I up to take a picture with a snake .<ssssss>not fun to be proposition over and over again when you be try to enjoy the beach .<ssssss>overall , the beach be the nicest i have be too , weather be beautiful all day long , resort grounds be nice , everything be very clean , but the staff be lack , and so be the buffet food .<ssssss>maybe it be because they be so new , and maybe they be understaffed and overworked , but the service really need to be improve upon .<ssssss>i probably would not recommend this hotel to my family or friend .<ssssss>not the service or food i would expect from a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 5 5 5 1 1 -1		a waste of money .<ssssss>spend a bit more and relish they sister hotel my fiance and i stay here during we christmas holiday from dec 22-28 the review of this place have we thrill and excite , but the only thing we leave china with be a polluted taste in we mouth and a assurance if we ever go back to beijing , ppw 's sister hotel , the regent , will see we business before this -3 star establishment ever do again .<ssssss>we book we reservation online through the goldpointsplus program and be guarantee the best rate bar none .<ssssss>when we check in , the desk clerk offer we a upgrade to a junior suite , -lrb- which we take -rrb- , but as we later find out , we be charge for the breakfast upgrade twice .<ssssss>after several complaint the manager offer we a 10 $ discount off we total bill , to which we refuse .<ssssss>in the end we be offer a free night ' stay , but to this day we be still wait for the refund we have be promise .<ssssss>we have be tell it could take as long as two month for the transaction to process , so i suppose we will just have to wait and see .<ssssss>the check in girl be nice enough to notice my christmas eve birthday and offer we a free birthday cake which be really thoughtful .<ssssss>with we upgrade we have access to the club lounge , but check in from there take more than two hour before we suite be ready and available for we .<ssssss>-lrb- we be tell there be clean issue , lightbulb issue , etc. -rrb- the lounge access be a constant issue and we be often deny use of the internet until i become angry enough half way through we stay that it never become a issue again .<ssssss>have lounge access make we feel more like thief than privleged guest .<ssssss>the room itself be wonderful and i have zero complaint about it -lrb- other than heat issue , but after a day or two , the thermostat be fairly easy to figure out -rrb- .<ssssss>we bedroom be spacious with ton of storage and even the plasma screen tv be enjoyable .<ssssss>the bed be a dream to sleep on and the bathroom be clean , spacious , and invite .<ssssss>i wish i could say the same for service and staff .<ssssss>we breakfast at ppw be the one thing i dreaded every single day .<ssssss>breakfast run from 6am -10 be -lrb- seem to end early by 4star standard -rrb- and thing be rarely -lrb- if ever -rrb- tend to .<ssssss>hot dish be greasy and clearly re-used from the day before , station be cramped and poorly maintain .<ssssss>we come late and the food be terrible .<ssssss>we come at 6am and the food be equally terrible if not more so .<ssssss>the chef work the egg station show I obvious and continual contempt when i ask for egg white omelet , cheese be leave to dry on plate , and cold cut look old and unappetizing .<ssssss>if you be go to do a buffet in a small space , do it small and do it fabulous , do not fill it with terrible food poorly prepare and easily forget .<ssssss>the morning of my birthday we come down late for breakfast and be tell we could not eat any food that be still out from buffet service .<ssssss>when we ask if we could have some of the cold dish we be not allow to do so , even though numerous table be still eat and help themselves to the clearly open buffet .<ssssss>we be force to order off the menu and we egg benedict be the worst thing i have ever try to eat in my life .<ssssss>the egg be hard boil and sit on spam and soggy toast , then broil .<ssssss>my fiance and i be absolute foody and this be a absolute travesty .<ssssss>the waitress clearly see i be upset and refuse to do anything about it .<ssssss>we politely voice we complaint to the manager , and the first thing he try to do be quiet we with the fact that a birthday cake be due to arrive in we room .<ssssss>he also tell we he would refund we breakfast , but we never hear back from he and the refund never do come .<ssssss>room service food be mediocre at best , and the infamous birthday cake be leave in we bedroom for four day , despite numerous request to have it remove .<ssssss>we try to be subtle at one point and destroy the cake with we cutlery and smear the plate to make it look like we would eat the thing -lrb- which we do not -rrb- .<ssssss>the cleaning staff actually replace we cutlery and plate but would not remove the cake !<ssssss>it take three separate phone call to housekeeping , room service , and finally the front desk , to get the offend dish remove .<ssssss>christmas eve be spend at ppw 's sister hotel the regent .<ssssss>let I say it right now ... pay the money and stay in luxury !<ssssss>the hotel be in much better condition -lrb- ppw 's lobby be date , dark , and dank , just like they in house restaurant -rrb- .<ssssss>the regent staff have smile on they face and look to truly enjoy they job .<ssssss>they be helpful , the atmosphere be one hundred time better than anything ppw have to offer , and they christmas eve seafood buffet be a dream worth wake up for !<ssssss>we even win two prize that night and be lucky enough to come back for a free christmas day lunch buffet and high tea in the lounge area .<ssssss>i could go on and on about more , but judge for yourself i suppose .<ssssss>i be thrill by the review post here and all my fiance and i experience be disappointment after disappointment .<ssssss>bottom line ?<ssssss>the room 's at ppw be up to par but everything else -lrb- staff , surroundings , service , food -rrb- be way below a 4star rating .<ssssss>again , pay the extra 10 or 20 dollar and upgrade yourself into a real hotel .<ssssss>

4 4 3 2 5 5 5 -1		fun , inexpensive place to enjoy the civic center area really a fun place to stay .<ssssss>wonderful restaurant on site .<ssssss>we be probably the oldest guest in residence and dining -- but feel welcome and comfortable .<ssssss>have some concern about the noise from the patio bar -- but it end amazingly promptly at around 11 pm !<ssssss>easy walking -lrb- away from the tenderloin -rrb- toward vanness -- multi-screen indie movie theatre nearby -- many dine option .<ssssss>we be stay because of promixity to the federal building , but will return just for fun .<ssssss>it be also a real bargain and we belong to the joy of life affinity club for this small hotel chain , so have a couple of extra goody throw in for free .<ssssss>

1 1 1 2 2 3 3 -1		awful i be currently stay at the hotel on business .<ssssss>as the employee of a large corporate customer of ic as well as a gold member of ic 's loyalty programme , i assume i would get good treatment and the website show nice room .<ssssss>however , despite ask for a river view room and be tell one be available , i be give a room in the city wing which have a stunning view of ... the river wing .<ssssss>oh , and a nice office block light up in blue neon all night so you have to keep the curtain close .<ssssss>the level of reflect noise from the street and the aircon unit on the river wing 's ground floor roof between the two hotel buidling ensure that sleep be suitably disturb .<ssssss>i have to admit , though , if you lean out of the 20th floor window -lrb- safe ! -rrb-<ssssss>and look left , you can indeed see the river.the room be tiny , the bed be not king size -lrb- as specify for the corporate rate my firm be pay -rrb- and there be no decent news or sport channel -lrb- in any language , do not have to be english ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the kettle malfunction so that when i make tea this morning i pour boiling water all over my bare foot - great start to the day .<ssssss>in addition , the shower hook do not allow for the shower to point into the bath so you have to hold it unless you want to huddle up against the tap and wall .<ssssss>in short , the room bear no relation to any display on the hotel 's website , the bed have two single duvet which i loathe -lrb- and which be why i book a king and not two singles in the first place -rrb- , and i be check out early and go somewhere else.i be sure if you stay in the river wing , it be lovely - reception be certainly much nicer than the city wing - but do not expect ic frankfurt to care about what you actually book or whether you be a member of the ic loyalty scheme .<ssssss>
3 3 5 3 4 2 2 3		do not expect much from the staff the room be nice and comfortable , but the staff be not close to acceptable , i have a package deliver before i check out , and even though i ask more than once at the front desk wether they have it or not , they always say nothing have arrive , now i have to have it pick up by a acquaintance in nyc .<ssssss>also , the concierge be unavailable most of the time .<ssssss>
2 2 4 2 5 4 2 1		overprice and overrate this hotel have the superficial appearance of a luxury 3?1/2 star hotel , however the service and accommodation be a far cry from outstanding .<ssssss>beware of the complimentary continental breakfast because you may end up be charge upon check out for food that be not include .<ssssss>when you go into the restaurant be breakfast be hold only certain food on the buffet be complimentary .<ssssss>i be surprise upon checkout with a charge for $ 70 for breakfast that be not included.they have a computer in the front desk with internet access guard by a person from the concierge to insure that you only check in you flight and print board pass .<ssssss>i ask to check my email and he inform I that i could not , but i could go to the business center , type in my credit card number , and use the internet as long as my heart desire .<ssssss>finally , if you do not read anything else read thisthis hotel be not one that be customer focus .<ssssss>they be friendly but in a superficial , all i care about be the money you will spend , sort of way .<ssssss>not everyone be this way , but most be .<ssssss>as a person who be big on customer focus and stellar customer service i would not recommend this hotel for anyone on vacation - business trip maybe .<ssssss>i be disappoint to say the least .<ssssss>they leave I the impression of a upper-class business swindler and i can only imagine how many people fall victim unaware .<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		great bargain we stay at the royal grove in oct 2004 , during a budget vacation to hawaii .<ssssss>the hotel and it be room be exactly what they look like on the website - very simple and a bit dated .<ssssss>if you be aware of this go in , you will not have any surprise .<ssssss>the location be amazing , though , and we hardly spend any time in the room .<ssssss>you can walk to the beach , shopping and restaurant .<ssssss>spend a few extra buck and get a room with ac - it help drown out the outside noise .<ssssss>buy some grocery and take advantage of the in-room fridge to help cut food cost .<ssssss>my only complaint be the door in the room have large air vent , so you hear everything from the hallway and sometimes from other room .<ssssss>this can effect sleep and romance .<ssssss>
3 2 2 1 5 5 5 -1		a bit disappointed the fairmont be a beautiful , older -lrb- but modernize -rrb- hotel in a prime seattle location .<ssssss>the hotel be walk distance from most city sight , include the waterfront , aquarium , shopping , market and many more .<ssssss>the lobby be old-style , large and comfortable , with oriental rug , lot of wood , etc. check-in be quick .<ssssss>get to the room -- not so quick .<ssssss>the hotel have four , quite small and quite slow elevator , one or more of which be almost always out of order in the two day we stay there .<ssssss>thus , at peak time such as morning and dinner-time , there be a 5-10 minute wait .<ssssss>and , when the elevator finally do arrive , it be fill , because it only hold 5-6 people , without luggage .<ssssss>with luggage , it be crowd with 3 .<ssssss>we room be disappointing .<ssssss>know that older hotel have a hodgepodge of room , many of which be smaller than modern hotel , i do not expect much .<ssssss>still the room be very small with no view .<ssssss>queen bed .<ssssss>only one chair -- thus , one of we have to sit on the bed to watch the very small tv .<ssssss>of course , because the chair and bed be directly opposite -lrb- and the room be too small to move the chair next to the bed -rrb- , we both could not watch tv at the same time w/o crane we neck .<ssssss>there be almost no place on the floor to put we suitcase and we end up trip over them.room decor be ok -- not memorable -- and bed be comfortable .<ssssss>the a/c work well and i believe there be a mini-bar -lrb- do not use it -rrb- .<ssssss>however , the room be so small that we do not want to do anything there but sleep.the bathroom , by contrast , be a good size with lot of marble and nice amenity .<ssssss>room be very well-insulated and there be a in-room safe .<ssssss>wakeup call be timely and staff be very friendly .<ssssss>the concierge desk be well-manned and provide excellent suggestions.we try the hotel restaurant for breakfast .<ssssss>the food be good and serve fairly promptly .<ssssss>cost be about what you would expect for a high-end hotel .<ssssss>workout room be modern and there be plenty of staff to assist.overall , the stay be ok but , if come again , for the same price i would stay down the street at the hotel monaco or just try another hotel in the city .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 2 3 4 -1		wonderful and yet nasty my wife and i -lrb- with we 19 month old toddler -rrb- just return from the el conqistador last night .<ssssss>we couldnt wait to post this review .<ssssss>the hotel be a study in contrast .<ssssss>i have never have such a experience with a hotel before - on the one hand the grounds be immaculate , in excellent condition , and the view be absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>the lobby be as expect for a 4 * hotel .<ssssss>however , once we step into the elevator to access the room , the beauty end .<ssssss>the elevator be dingy , the corridor access and area just outside of the elevator be filthy - downright nasty , with baked in dirt and filth mark on the outside of the garbage receptacle just outside of the elevator .<ssssss>we notice cigarette butt , dirt , significant dust bunny -lrb- more like dust elephant , give the size -rrb- and stain all over the tile .<ssssss>we feel like we be dirty by the time we get to we room .<ssssss>what be worse be that the dirt and filth remain for the duration of we stay - from thursday to sunday .<ssssss>and yes , the room be very date .<ssssss>that by itself be not bad , but the bedspread be never properly make up , and by the third day we become convinced that it be not that the maid be inefficient , but that the bedspread be old and too wear to ever look neat .<ssssss>the furniture be part rattan , part antique and part modern -lrb- they have a dvd player alonside a 1980 's cd player -rrb- , all in serious need of a brush of varnish/paint and repair.the view from the room - we stay in the la vista wing - be really special , except that you dont risk open you door much for the noise from the lobby and pool area just below .<ssssss>neither do you risk open the shades for the view unless you dont mind flash everyone in the pool and general activity area , as all the oceanview room be in full public view of everyone in the pool and activity areas.the less say on this subject the better .<ssssss>you can do much better go into fajardo and buying at sizzler or wendy .<ssssss>in fact you can do better just eat at a mall food court .<ssssss>unless of course , you really enjoy bland overpriced food -lrb- my wife keep remind I that the food isnt awful , just tasteless , and that it could have be worse . -rrb-<ssssss>true.the service be generally good .<ssssss>puerto rican hospitality be very positive and warm and the hotel be no exception .<ssssss>from the concierge to the bellhop , to the parking shuttle driver , the service be above par.and speaking of parking .<ssssss>you should drive , but remember that parking be a nice distance away and the wait on the parking shuttle to the lobby can be dreadfully delay .<ssssss>worse , friday night we find ourselves drive around in circle for over 20 minute in the parking lot just try to find parking , which be non-existent .<ssssss>we notice that they be now build a parking ramp building - which be well overdue as the resort be huge , like mad huge .<ssssss>this become a nightmare when you want to checkout and its a sunday .<ssssss>its like check-in day at a cruise terminal .<ssssss>crowd .<ssssss>if you like massive resort , you will like el conquistador , especially after they complete they renovation , which the frontdesk staff tell I will be complete by this time next year .<ssssss>i for one will want to see if the hotel itself will match up to its grounds and view by then .<ssssss>if you like a intimate setting , it be not for you .<ssssss>stay they be like a mini city on a hill which feel like a mega all-inclusive , but have worse tasting -lrb- and expensive -rrb- food.all in all i would definitely return , if only out of curiosity after they renovation .<ssssss>
2 2 3 4 4 1 3 -1		do not stay here my husband i stay at the hotel balestri for 2 night in february .<ssssss>while i do not recommend this hotel , i can not find fault with its location - across the street from the arno river , a short walk to the ponte vecchio , santa maria croce and the uffizi .<ssssss>while the hotel be under renovation during we stay - that be not even the issue .<ssssss>the front desk staff be so rude !<ssssss>the woman who check we in -lrb- early afternoon -rrb- seem so put off when i ask if she have a map of florence -lrb- this be in stark contrast to we stay in rome and venice -rrb- .<ssssss>there always seem to be two people at the desk in the evening - a older gentleman and a kid -lrb- i be sure he be older than a kid but to I he look 15 -rrb- .<ssssss>the older man could not be bother to acknowledge we and the younger man seem uncomfortable to be there .<ssssss>the breakfast be by far the worst of the three hotel -lrb- hotel nazionale in rome and hotel doge orseolo in venice -rrb- and barely edible .<ssssss>stale bread - ugh !<ssssss>i would not stay here again - i know there must be better !<ssssss>
3 5 5 5 4 3 2 3		it be get cheaper -- in more way than one this be the seventh of the last eight christmas at the hilton hawaiian village 's upscale ali'i tower .<ssssss>it be more economical , but the service plain and simply be not what it have be in previous years.the room itself be fine and scenic .<ssssss>i ask in advance for a upgrade to ocean view ali'i from partial ocean view ali'us , and it be wait on arrival .<ssssss>also ask for a quiet room , and it be that , too .<ssssss>room itself be fine , and the view of the pacific from the 12th floor for a retireee rate of $ 269 a night plus tax , include free hors d'oerve poolside each night , and -lrb- with my hilton gold membership -rrb- free continental breakfast , be in my opinion a good bargain .<ssssss>also get a complimentary fresh fruit amenity plate on arrival.the price have drop twice since i book it in march -- hilton do not tell I this , but when i see it on they website i rebook it each time .<ssssss>consider the category -- ocean view honolulu beach resort at christmas -- i have no complaint about price.so , what be the problem?mainly , housekeeping and service .<ssssss>specifically , little thing that be omit .<ssssss>when you read this list , it will seem petty , but remember , the ali'i tower be suppose to be the upscale tower of the hilton -lrb- ali'i mean elite in hawaiian -rrb- .<ssssss>earlier this decade they use to have a fancy-white-uniform doorman at the tower door , and they service room three time daily -lrb- that be overkill , i admit -- even a bother -- but it show how seriously they use to take service .<ssssss>but now , no doorman , once-a-day housekeeping , and , my gripe : * no laundry/dry clean bag in the holder provide for they .<ssssss>* no ice bag liner for the ice bucket two night out of five .<ssssss>* tv remote that would not work , and when i call guest service hotline ring so long it go to a recording .<ssssss>finally get a human to take the tv trouble call , but then no one show up and i have to call again .<ssssss>* forget to leave regular coffee packet the last day , only decaf .<ssssss>* hilton bedside chocolate only one night out of five .<ssssss>* poolside continental breakfast have now go over $ 20 for those who be not gold member , the fresh-produce quality seem to have decline , and they have switch to disposable plate and dish , and plastic utensils.is it still a decent hotel ?<ssssss>yes.is it a good bargain ?<ssssss>it certainly can be if you book carefully , and keep check back .<ssssss>sure be for me.is it the luxury deluxe tower it use to be ?<ssssss>absolutely not .<ssssss>
2 1 3 2 3 1 4 4		not a good experience i do not even know how to start ... well you room will not be ready until almost 4pm ; *** this be not a place for tourist *** i would say 85 % of the visitor be resident of the island , place like pool table , basketball court and big part of the pool and bar be usually take by resident ; the food be not the best in the main diner , but i get to say , if you do reservation on the exclusive restaurant -lrb- mexican , japanny , spain and brazillian ; all 4 star -rrb- you will love it , but because everyone want to go there , they be just look around just to see if you finish to almost kick you out because they have people waitting , so , you have to eat in a hurry -lrb- but the food be good -rrb- ; i will recommend that you kid use water shoe to get in the pool , cuz the flood its too rustic and they may have minor cut -lrb- mine kid do -rrb- ; room service be fine , do not see anything fun at night , casino be empty , and the kid club its a simple play ground like the one on you nearest park , the beach be nice but i be sorry i do not recommend or return to this hotel ; i have be in 2 other resort in punta cana before and i have a great experience , but this one 0 .<ssssss>

4 5 5 5 5 2 2 5		great hotel !<ssssss>my 8 year old and i be on a alone getaway to see wicked in la .<ssssss>the omnus get good review here , so i book it .<ssssss>the club level room we get be $ 219 per night , cheaper than some of the regular room .<ssssss>i find the rate online , but call to confirm the ammenity .<ssssss>join the frequent guest program for extra perk .<ssssss>perk of the club level room be a room on the top -lrb- 17th -rrb- floor -lrb- with key access to the floor -rrb- , complementary breakfast -lrb- french toast , bacon , lox and bagel , fruit , etc etc -rrb- , and complementary cocktail hour from 5-8 -lrb- alcohol , soda , snack -rrb- .<ssssss>there be so much at the cocktail hour that it be dinner for we !<ssssss>hotel ammenity : small outdoor pool -lrb- too cold outside for we to go in but the pool be warm -rrb- , nice workout room , comfy bed , window that open .<ssssss>when we check in we be give a backpack of toy for my daughter .<ssssss>all good .<ssssss>oh , and we rate include complementary valet parking -lrb- normally $ 30 per night -rrb- .<ssssss>the only problem be that when we call the front desk last night at 9pm to ask about the circle helicopter a couple block away , we be inform that it be due to a movie be film -lrb- 500 day of summer be be film in the park right outside the hotel during the day -rrb- .<ssssss>luckily , we decide not to go check it out , because it be actually the police look for a sniper shooting from another hotel into the street .<ssssss>i have a little chat with the front desk manager about this .<ssssss>she do not seem to grasp the severity of the mistake .<ssssss>i suspect that as long as thing go smoothly , this be a great hotel .<ssssss>and , except for the idiot at the front desk , thing go very smoothly .<ssssss>the staff be not the brightest bulb on the string , but they be very friendly.i would stay here again for sure , especially with the kid !<ssssss>i just would not ask anyone here for advice .<ssssss>

3 2 2 5 1 5 4 5		dissapointed i travel a lot and stay at many different class of hotel .<ssssss>when book the crowne plaza i expect it to be pretty good .<ssssss>upon walk in the lobby i be very impressed .<ssssss>the lobby be very nice with a business center include computer and printer that be easily accessible .<ssssss>there be a mini gift shop with snack , drink and even microwave dinner that be open 24 hour .<ssssss>the restaurant and bar look nice and there be even a starbuck stand that be open until 1pm daily .<ssssss>once i get to my room though ... i be very dissapointed .<ssssss>the room have a terrible odor .<ssssss>the toilet and shower be dirty .<ssssss>it look like the room have not be clean properly after it be use last .<ssssss>honestly - i be afraid to use the cup provide -lrb- i go to the gym and get plastic cup for my water -rrb- .<ssssss>i keep the window open to try and air out the room to get out the smell but be cold because the bed be not very warm .<ssssss>there be a very rough waffle blanket over the sheet that could be feel all night against my skin - not very comfortable .<ssssss>i could hear a train go by during the night , then before i need to wake up the alarm in the room next to I be go off and never do get shut off .<ssssss>in the morning , i go to order room service breakfast , but could only find a lunch and dinner menu .<ssssss>i call and order french toast , bacon with a side of fresh strawberry and a pot of coffee .<ssssss>the coffee be horrible - taste like dirty water .<ssssss>the french toast be cold -lrb- the butter would not even melt - it too be right out of the fridge , or maybe freezer ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the bacon be probably crispy when it be hot , but now cold it be rubbery .<ssssss>the strawberry be good ... they be cold too -lrb- the only thing i want cold ! -rrb-<ssssss>i think this hotel do not live up to the price .<ssssss>
2 2 1 3 5 2 5 1		not a 4 star my 2 friend and i stay at this resort from april 19 to may 3 and i can say it be the worst vacation i have ever have .<ssssss>we book as premium class , get to we room after carr we own luggage up 3 story -lrb- we be in early 60 's -rrb- only to find we have one bed for the 3 of we , go back to the desk and find out there be not another room available untill mthe next day , we agree on a cot for that night and 2:00 in the morning they finally arrive with the cot , next day we have to fight with the front desk and finally felix till we get a room around 3:00 in the evening , then it rain and rain and we have leak on we bed on the luggage and over the tv .<ssssss>we move again only to find ourselves go into a one bed room again , the bell boy have to phone the front desk and find we another room.this be not a 4 stay hotel , , , , , the service be great staff in the dining room and maid be awesome , but the place itself need some serious overalli would not recommend anyone to this hotel ,<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 4 5 4 2		perfect surprise perfect location .<ssssss>excellent staff .<ssssss>the room be perfect â?we stay in one of the top storey room with a patio .<ssssss>there be a/c in the room but we do not need it â?two window have a good breeze go .<ssssss>room be cleanthe best part for we -lrb- and i can see how it could be the worst part for some -rrb- be presence of two bar adjacent to the hotel .<ssssss>one have customer occupy el callejon -lrb- little walk street -rrb- on which hotel be located every night .<ssssss>they create a street ambiance that my wife and i love !<ssssss>on top of that , the second place â?âThe nuorican cafÃ©â ?<ssssss>that i think , be similar to the one in nyc , have life music blast every night !<ssssss>most of the night it be salsa !<ssssss>one day it be latin rock !<ssssss>my previous trip to pr i have to look for salsa place , and with regaton invasion it be a difficult task , believe I !<ssssss>this time we have salsa party with life music go on every night next door !<ssssss>that be beyond my wildest dream .<ssssss>both of we adore salsa and love to dance .<ssssss>we be very happy with we stay in da hause.thank you all very much !<ssssss>
4 3 4 5 5 2 3 -1		great location we arrive at the peninsula excelsior at 3am .<ssssss>the check-in clerk indicate that we would have a wait of about 20 minute while staff ready a new room for we due to a burst pipe on the floor of we reserved room .<ssssss>the old room be in the peninsula tower , and the new room be in the excelsior tower , which i suspect work in we favor .<ssssss>we excelsior tower room be quite nice .<ssssss>it be spacious and comfortable .<ssssss>it be clearly a older hotel , but have be maintain well and be keep quite clean .<ssssss>we breakfast , which be not include in we room price be quite expensive.we could not have ask for a better location .<ssssss>it be a easy walk to the marina , shopping , and most tourist site .<ssssss>
2 1 1 5 4 3 3 -1		worst value in amsterdam this hotel be just a great disappointment.the first room we have have a average view on a small courtyard but it have two bed and we want a double bed so we ask to change .<ssssss>the second room have indeed a double bed , but it have a only a very small window face a wall!both room be small , dark , with average decoration and furniture.the decoration of the common area do not match the standing of the hotel either , except for the bar and the restaurant , which be nice .<ssssss>however , they be on the other side of the buiding , and , in order to get there , you must take a long and gloomy corridor , with no decoration , which look like you be in a basic motel.we use the room service for dinner the first night because we arrive late , and we also take breakfast in we room .<ssssss>the food be also very disappointing for a hotel which be suppose to be first class .<ssssss>
3 2 3 2 2 3 5 2		plan to spend out of pocket for everything the grounds be lovely and the room be adequate .<ssssss>many of the pool and hot tub be open 24 hour which be very nice , especially when the day be so hot.the two unexpected disappointment be 1 -rrb- despite the fact that the resort tack a $ 25/day resort fee onto you room , many of the list amenity be somehow not cover by this fee .<ssssss>want to play tennis on one of the seven court ?<ssssss>plan on shell out $ 20/hour and buy a can of tennis ball for $ 5 from the tennis booth .<ssssss>plan on bring you own car ?<ssssss>-lrb- i would recommend it since there be nothing within walk distance of the resort for shopping/dining/movies , etc. -rrb- valet parking cost $ 25/day and self parking cost $ 10/day .<ssssss>do those poolside tent cabana look like a fun place to hang out ?<ssssss>they range in price from $ 300 - $ 500 !<ssssss>2 -rrb- one of the three restaurant be , unbeknownst to we , close for remodel which severely limit the dining option .<ssssss>that leave guest to choose from room service -lrb- very expensive with gratuity tack onto the already way overpriced food -rrb- , wright 's fine dining -lrb- good , very expensive , very decadent food , not a good place for a light meal in the heat of the day and not enough vareity on the menu when it be the only full-service restaurant on property right now -rrb- or the cafe which be really a small deli where one have a very limited selection of pastry and sandwich for anywhere between twice and five time the price they would be off the resort property .<ssssss>if you do not have a car -lrb- which we do not -rrb- you be stick with the limited food option and the highly overpriced dining options.that say , the pool , landscaping and staff be terrific .<ssssss>we enjoy massage in the spa -lrb- the steam room and one of the shower in the spa man 's locker room be break and the locker room/spa area could have be much cleaner -rrb- and the run of the property but we find that we keep ask staff how much do this cost ?<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 5 4 2		great for first time i decide now to write this review because i really see how helpfull they be ... we have be to carabela from 11/06/2004 - 11/14/2004 on a all inclusive plan .<ssssss>the resort be rate 4.5 starz and i think it almost deserve that .<ssssss>they be extend they construction -lrb- probably they be do by now -rrb- .<ssssss>we find a lot of helpfull tip on -lsb- -- -rsb- you have to tip the guy at the front office -lrb- reception -rrb- - $ 10 to give you the ` best room ocean view ' - we do and we be happy with the roomthe food be ok , you should go to the a la carte restaurants-0 especially el almirante - very good food and servicebr a lot of $ 1 bill - for clean lady , for the bar -lrb- always tip the same guy - i use to give $ 1 when i arrive and $ 1 when i left-usually with something to go ... -rrb- it be a very nice and quiet place , good for fammily - they do not have a kid club-just a playground - but sometimes we would let we kid there with one of the security guy - there be a lot of they - that be why the beach be ok , nobody from outside can come on resort grounds -- that be the bestwe go shop around for souvenir - you have to bargain a lot .<ssssss>we buy a big caracol -lrb- the big shell -rrb- and some painting and statue -lrb- small -rrb- for less than 1/4 of what they ask .<ssssss>do not show they big bill - go shopping with $ 1 and $ 5 billslearn some spanish - they be friendly when you talk to they -- almost nobody understand englishhave fun nomater what !<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 5 4 5 -1		great time , but problem with the room .<ssssss>i read a lot of review about the occidental grand flamenco prior to travel there from april 18-25 .<ssssss>when we read about the problem people have with the occidental punta cana , we be optimistic that those people be just finicky traveler who insist on be treat like royalty .<ssssss>unfortunately , we run into a lot of the same issue that i have read about here .<ssssss>check inâWe didnât have any problem at check in .<ssssss>transfer to the hotel from the airport be a breeze , and a short one at that .<ssssss>when we arrive at the hotel , someone meet we in the lobby with a welcome and a glass of juice .<ssssss>we arrive at the hotel around 11am , and check in be not until 3pm .<ssssss>from read all of the review on this website , i be aware that half of the room at the resort have be renovate .<ssssss>when we check in , i ask the gentleman at the front desk if we could be place in a renovate room , and give he a $ 20 tip .<ssssss>he say he would see what he could do .<ssssss>we have a few hour to kill , so we check out the grounds , have lunch , and hang out in the lobby .<ssssss>when 3pm roll around , there be a huge line at the front desk .<ssssss>the guy i have speak to earlier remember I and immediately waive I over to the side of the counter .<ssssss>he say he couldnât get we in a renovate room , but put we close to the pool and the lobby -lrb- which be very convenient for we -rrb- .<ssssss>the $ 20 i tip he didnât get we a update room , but i figure it be worth since we didnât have to stand in the long check in line .<ssssss>roomsâHonestly , the room be the biggest disappointment for we .<ssssss>i have read a lot of review on here from people i specifically email we travel agent before hand about this , and i be assure weâd get a king bed .<ssssss>lo and behold , we have two twin bed push together .<ssssss>i go back to the front desk and ask about move to a room with a king-sized bed , but the guy at the desk tell I they be full and i would have to come back to speak to a manager the next day .<ssssss>at the same time i be there , someone who be on we transfer from the airport be yell at the front desk that the ceiling in he room be bow down and look it be go to cave in .<ssssss>weâre pretty lay back people and didnât want to act like spoil tourist , so we just deal with the bed .<ssssss>however , once we get settle in , we notice a lot of little thing wrong with the room .<ssssss>two of the light in the room didnât work .<ssssss>i try swap out bulb from one of the work lamp , but they didnât work either , so it be a electrical problem .<ssssss>the refrigerator in we room didnât work .<ssssss>my wife check to see if it be plug in , and she get a electrical shock from the plug .<ssssss>when i pull the fridge away from the wall a bit , i see that the electrical cord have fray and have no insulation on it for a good three or four inch from the plug .<ssssss>the water situation be also problematic .<ssssss>water come out of the shower in a very slow and small stream -- hardly any water pressure .<ssssss>i wound up remove the showerhead and showering under the open water pipe instead .<ssssss>two of the night , we didnât have any hot water .<ssssss>again , we just suck it up and do we best to deal with it .<ssssss>on the last night , we didnât have any run water in the room at all .<ssssss>the only issue we complain about be the slide glass door to we porch .<ssssss>we be on the ground floor , and the glass door didnât close all the way or lock .<ssssss>we purchase the safe key -lrb- be sure to do this , by the way -rrb- for we valuable , but i still feel uneasy have a open and unlock door all the time .<ssssss>i speak to the apple vacation rep who be onsite and it be fix the next day .<ssssss>for what itâs worth , the hotel leave a maintenance request form in every room .<ssssss>i donât know if thatâs necessarily a good thing .<ssssss>we run into quite a few people who have similar problem in they room .<ssssss>we meet two couple who be on they honeymoon .<ssssss>both of they have pay for the honeymoon upgrade package .<ssssss>sometime during they stay , someone in the hotel âlostâ?the paper say they be entitle to the honeymoon package .<ssssss>other also have problem with the water pressure .<ssssss>weatherâThe weather be great .<ssssss>it rain a couple of time , but for the most part there be shower that move through quickly .<ssssss>it do rain very hard for most of we last day there , and that create some problem .<ssssss>the area around we building smell like sewage after the rain -lrb- i suspect this have something to do with we not have any run water the last night -rrb- .<ssssss>also , the building have a open architecture .<ssssss>the room across the hall from we be at the bottom of the step lead to the second floor .<ssssss>all of the rain water have run down the step and be go under the door to that room -lrb- the people stay there have towel roll up in front of the door and at the bottom of the step -rrb- .<ssssss>serviceâThe service be great .<ssssss>we leave the maid a couple of dollar every morning .<ssssss>she bring we new beach towel twice a dayâonce in the morning and once in the afternoon .<ssssss>when i leave she a note -lrb- use my limited spanish -rrb- ask for diet coke for the fridge , she replace all of the regular coke that be in the fridge and leave we a couple of extra every day on top .<ssssss>i wear a beat-up t-shirt with the sleeve cut off to the pool every day .<ssssss>when i it on the bed , she fold it in a fan pattern .<ssssss>we also get massage in the spa one afternoon , and they be very good .<ssssss>foodâThe food be pretty good .<ssssss>the buffet have a lot of choice and we didnât get bore .<ssssss>the burger at the home rum place by the pool be fantasticâthe late night pizza place be absolutely outstanding , especially of a few hour of drinking .<ssssss>there be four a la carte restaurantsâItalian , oriental , mexican , and a brazilian steakhouse .<ssssss>the resort only let you make reservation for three , but on we last night , we go to the fourth one and ask the maitreâd politely if we could come in despite not have a reservation .<ssssss>he seat we without any problem -lrb- after dinner i give he $ 10 and tell he how much we appreciate it -rrb- .<ssssss>the oriental place be awesome , the brazilian place be very good , and the other two be ok but nothing special to we .<ssssss>oh , and the coffee be great -lrb- iâm a big coffee drinker -rrb- .<ssssss>entertainmentâThis be the best part of the trip for I .<ssssss>the bartender be all fantastic .<ssssss>we make sure to tip the bartender a couple of buck each night , and it really seem to help .<ssssss>at night , the hotel lobby be usually pack with people drink at the bar .<ssssss>there be several time where i didnât even finish my beer before the bartender take it away and refill my cup .<ssssss>there be entertainment in the lobby almost every night , and there be usually a lot of people dance and party .<ssssss>if youâre drinking at the lobby bar , be sure to have a shot of mamma juanna or , if youâre really adventurous , order a âReady to goâ ?<ssssss>we never make it over to mangu , the disco .<ssssss>the pool and the beach be also great .<ssssss>cultureâWe take two excursion off the resort .<ssssss>one be the outback safari , where you tour the island on the back of a open truck .<ssssss>we visit a cigar factory , a coffee plantation , a typical dominican house , and then go boogie board on a secluded beach .<ssssss>it be totally worth it .<ssssss>the guide be great and we learn a lot .<ssssss>the second trip be a all-day affair on a air condition tour bus .<ssssss>we go to a small cigar factory in la romana , a underground cave , altos de chavon , and a shopping plaza which be little more than a duty free shop .<ssssss>we think this tour be way too long -lrb- we be go from the resort for about 12 hour -rrb- , and didnât learn nearly as much .<ssssss>the picture we take at altos de chavon be amazing though .<ssssss>lastly , i hate shopping to begin with , but the dominican style of bartering be even more irritating .<ssssss>there be a series of shop a couple hundred yard down the beach .<ssssss>the people who work there be very aggressive about try to get you into they store -lrb- theyâre worse than the timeshare people on the resort -rrb- .<ssssss>if you come in , they give you something small like a keychain or a necklace for free , make you then feel obligate to buy something .<ssssss>there arenât price on anything , so be prepare to barter .<ssssss>one of the guy want $ 100 for a painting we see in another store for $ 15 .<ssssss>also , be aware of fake cigar .<ssssss>all in all , we have a good time in punta cana .<ssssss>we stay at the occidental grand aruba last year for we honeymoon and have a outstanding time , so this one be a little bit of a let down to we , but like i say , we try to make the best of it .<ssssss>i have to say that this website be invaluable in provide we on info about what to expect on we vacation .<ssssss>i hope this review help you plan yours .<ssssss>

's just to scrimp on scratchy tissue that hurt you nose ... two final complaint : the elevator be so incredibly slow !<ssssss>and , the blackout that i endure while get ready for the evening be very inconvenient .<ssssss>i know that it be not they fault that the power go out , but it will , of course , remain a tarnish on my trip as i scramble to dress , do my hair and apply make-up all in the dark.i do , however , like the view i have from my room and those from the balcony at the ghostbar .<ssssss>the bar have a fun atmosphere , though the service be less than impressive.all in all , i do not expect that i will return to the w when i be in dallas again .<ssssss>i have hear that w 's in other city provide better service , so may try one of those in the future , however .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 3 1 3 3		only ok when we arrive , the hotel have we reservation wrong , although we book directly with they .<ssssss>with confirmation in hand , i show they the two couple have reserve king bed room .<ssssss>they have one king reserve and one with two queen bed .<ssssss>it take they over 30 minute to find a second king bed room and check we in ... not the best way to start a vacation.while we be wait for we room , we go to lunch at the pool restaurant ... 4 people , some wing , some salad , some drink ... $ 150 plus tip , and the food be not great .<ssssss>.<ssssss>then there be the room , they be holiday inn quality , the bathroom be old and do not have a seperate shower , the furniture be nothing special , the balcony be very small with two little metal chair and a small round table .<ssssss>we be all very disappointed with the rooms.the beach be beautiful , large and not crowd .<ssssss>the breakfast buffet be very good .<ssssss>the staff be lovely .<ssssss>except the front desk , where incompetence rule .<ssssss>both couple bill be wrong , have to be correct no less than three times.i would not return to this hotel , definitely not worth it .<ssssss>

-rrb-<ssssss>we make a point at the end of we holiday to tip female more.we always tip maid and fridge people about $ 2 dollar daily but once we forget to leave anything as we leave early and it make no difference but just remember it may be nothing to we but a hell of a lot to them!entertainment : - most common complaint amongst the rest of holiday maker we speak to be that at night there be nothing to do as disco be really smelly and dark and casino be a absolute rip off , theatre bar be gear towards spanish speak guest and so have a few cocktail in the bar be just about all there be really.brush up on you spanish before you go!excursions : - saona island be to die for - the whole day be a day that will live with I forever , it be fab , we pick up great big beautiful shell on the shore and all in all have fabulous time.monster truck safari : - unmissable - such fun and facinating to see the real dominica , take old clothes for the poor people at the railway track where the voodoo doctor be as they as they be so in need.flies and bug : - fly and bug be everywhere but i think it be because of the humid weather but after about the 5th or 6th day they really start to get to I as well as the really damp smell as it be everywhere!i be not posh , high maintenance or fussy but after just about a week i want to come home , i have be abroad numerous time and usually be on a downer about 3 day before come home cause i do not want to , i even imagine myself live there but not this time , i be ready for home about 8 day in and even my husband who never complain say the same thing.hotel shop ; - mega expensive , over inflated price just what you would expect from hotel shop really but pay in dollar and get you change in peso so take both!summary : - barcelo premium punta cana - great beach , great female staff , tired and smelly communal area and entertainment at night very poor , overall this hotel be in dire need of a makeover.any question - e-mail I and happy hol x<ssssss>

4 5 3 4 3 5 4 3		tremendous value we stay here november 1-8 , 2008 .<ssssss>the review i read be decidedly mixed but in spite of this i book a stay in a 1 bedroom suite .<ssssss>the suite consist of 2 hotel room with a connect door .<ssssss>one room be set up as a bedroom with a bath , the queen size bed look tiny in the room , the other room be set up as a living room and a kitchen as well as a bath .<ssssss>the living room have 2 couch that be pullout that be serviceable but not great bed .<ssssss>the room be clean and the maid service be exactly as the hotel describe .<ssssss>the staff be very friendly and helpful .<ssssss>when we check in we be give a very complete run-down of the activity and service the hotel provide .<ssssss>wireless internet be provide as part of the 3.99 per night resort fee as be access to the business center computer and printer.if you be look for luxury and ocean view , keep look , if you be look for value and expect to spend you day at the beach or see the many site this be the place for you .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 2 3 -1 -1		a short enjoyable stay stay at this hotel with my girlfriend for two night .<ssssss>the hotel be very basic , but we be in san francisco to see the city , not the hotel.the room be small but clean overlook the street and we have a great view .<ssssss>the elevator scare I a little , but it seem to work for most people who be not as claustrophobic as i be .<ssssss>as i do not like the elevator i walk to the seventh floor everytime we walk in or out .<ssssss>at least we get we daily work out !<ssssss>; -rrb- the staff be curteous and check we in without a problem.the breakfast consist of bagel and cream cheese basically .<ssssss>coffee be available as well .<ssssss>a budget hotel i would definitely recommend for someone on a budget who want to have everything within walk distance .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 3 -1 4 -1		just ok , nothing more stay at nadia hotel for one night , in a single room.so my rewiew be base on the single room.the room be really , really small , actually the smallest ive ever visited.the room have the most necceasry thing , but no shower soap.i give this hotel on star for the loccation , which be really great.short walk to anne frank house , and short walk to dam square.i also give one star to the helpful staff , they be very keen to help I arrange thing .<ssssss>i pay 85 euro for one night , it dont think thats worth it.so , my conclusion be ; i wont stay here again .<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 4 2 2 3		a bit of style , not a lot of substance this be a small boutique hotel with cozy , chic room that be ideal for a weekend visit to london .<ssssss>but if you be look for a hotel that have all the usual mod con this be not it .<ssssss>hotel 41 rely on the hotel next door -lrb- the ruben -rrb- for a lot of its service which make the hotel incredibly inefficient .<ssssss>thing you take for grant in other hotel be a absolute chore here -lrb- and the staff make it feel that way too -rrb- .<ssssss>the porter have to run from the hotel next door to greet you if he be not too busy and food take forever to arrive either to you room or in the club lounge .<ssssss>if you just need a nice look room for a night this fit the bill - otherwise look elsewhere - there be much better alternative for the same price .<ssssss>
5 -1 5 5 5 3 3 5		amazing hotel !<ssssss>we stay at this hotel last week and it be lovely - the decor throughout be gorgeous it be only a few minute walk from the tube station only a few block away from the eiffel tower.we have such a amazing time in paris as it be we first time but the hotel be such a great find , there be so many to choose from but we definatley make the right choice when we book the are eiffel.i would most certainly recommend this hotel to anyone , it be spotless , the woman on the front desk be helpful the location be perfect !<ssssss>
5 -1 5 4 5 4 5 1		very nice this hotel be very nice .<ssssss>i be just there for a very large conference .<ssssss>i read the review on this site and be a bit apprehensive by some comment .<ssssss>my husband be the one participate in the conference and i would basicly be on my own every day , during the day .<ssssss>the hotel be in a decent location -lrb- within walk distance to many place -rrb- on we way to chinatown we be able to catch the love parade on saturday ... interesting !!<ssssss>i do not know man -lrb- only 3 but more than enough for my taste -rrb- could down a busy city street buck naked .<ssssss>my stomach hurt from laugh so hard .<ssssss>sorry guy there be no girl to follow suit .<ssssss>also i get to see the motorcade of the king of sweden pass in front of the hotel .<ssssss>not everyday that you get to see that .<ssssss>anyway ... back to the hotel .<ssssss>we king room be big enough for the 2 of we .<ssssss>the bed be fantastic .<ssssss>thumb up of that one .<ssssss>i read on this site that a coffee maker be not supply , so i bring my own .<ssssss>the pot however break during the flight .<ssssss>i call the front desk and they provide we with a coffee maker .<ssssss>it be 2 cup only but good enough to get I go .<ssssss>you just have to call the front dest and ask for it and it be provide at no charge .<ssssss>the internet service , however , be not .<ssssss>the conference that we attend pick up the tab on all of we internet service .<ssssss>if you be attend a conference , you should ask the front desk to see if you conference be the same .<ssssss>if that have not be we case i would have be upset .<ssssss>if you be read this marroitt , please consider change this policy and make it comp .<ssssss>the conference that we attend demand nothing but perfection and this hotel certainly step up to the plate .<ssssss>the reception , food and staffing be top notch.we have a terrible view of a roof but we never request a view so no complaint here.my recommendation : mel drive in across the street be great for a quick breakfast or lunch .<ssssss>very busy , fast service , cute happy day decor , good food at a decent price.i do not like the bistro across the street for dinner .<ssssss>i think it be over price and i do not like to have to ask for a explanation of the item on the menu .<ssssss>this resturant just leave a bad taste in my mouth .<ssssss>if you listen to one thing that i say , go the beard papa 's right behind the marroitt .<ssssss>they have the best cream puff that you have ever taste .<ssssss>i have the vanilla bean and it be out of this world .<ssssss>i be not a sweet eater but i hear about this place and i could not resist .<ssssss>wow , you just have to try it for yourself to see what i mean .<ssssss>over all , i would say that this be a very pleasurable stay .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 4 4 3		great location the location be what make this hotel so good .<ssssss>the accommodation themselves be not great , as the hotel be a bit older - uncomfortable bed , scuffed wall , mismatched decor , ancient hair dryer !<ssssss>but it be right in the heart of florence , a few minute ' walk from pittus palace in one direction , and across the bridge to the uffizi , excellent shop dine in the other direction .<ssssss>not sure if i would stay here again simply b/c the hotel itself be not a comfortable stay .<ssssss>breakfast find I walk across the street to the cafe by the 2nd morning to find something worth eating .<ssssss>but again , walk distance from everything you could possibly want to see in downtown florence .<ssssss>
3 3 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		first timer in paris my girlfriend and i book we weekend trip via the eurostar website .<ssssss>hotel littre 's location suit we very well .<ssssss>we walk or take the metro to all of the site without much trouble .<ssssss>there be plenty of good restaurant , brasserie , delicious bakery and shop near by too.overall we be satisfy with the hotel , it do seem a bit stick in the late 1970 's , but the staff be polite and attentive and we room be clean and quiet .<ssssss>how ever we be non-plussed as to why it be class as a four star hotel .<ssssss>we room and en-suite bathroom be in serious need of decoration as it all feel a bit tired and worn .<ssssss>there be no special touch usually associate with a four star hotel .<ssssss>one last thing , on sunday evening we tell front desk staff about we intention to check out at 10am on monday and ask about the need to book a taxi to gar du norde .<ssssss>we be tell not to worry they could organise this in the morning , no problem .<ssssss>monday morning , after settle we extra 's bill we potter off for a final stroll with we baggage leave in reception .<ssssss>on return we ask for we taxi to be call , only to be tell rather snottily by reception , who seem to have wash he hand of we , that it would be very difficult because of the fare !?<ssssss>we wait patiently whilst a really sweet guy -lrb- desk porter ? -rrb-<ssssss>try in vain to get we a taxi , but we end up rush to the station via the metro , a bit of a struggle with all we baggage and leave we feel a bit peeved to say the least .<ssssss>we would try somewhere else next time .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 3 3		great location have just return from a 4 night stay at the london nyc .<ssssss>the location be superb within easy walk distance of broadway theatre , fifth avenue shopping and time square .<ssssss>the suite be spacious , clean and stylish however there be a few less positive point to raise .<ssssss>check in be disorganised and the twin room i book be not ready until after 6pm .<ssssss>i feel that the reception staff be a little disinterested and do not go out of they way to help .<ssssss>there be 3 of we stay and the twin bed be actually single bed , so we request a roll away which be quite uncomfortable .<ssssss>while wait for the room , we have a drink in the bar area - 2 small glass of house wine cost $ 40 with tip .<ssssss>on the first night we order room service - the bill for 3 very average sandwich and drink be $ 170 .<ssssss>there be plenty of less expensive diner and restaurant close to the hotel .<ssssss>ellen 's stardust diner be great fun .<ssssss>overall , we love the hotel , have a great stay and would definately return<ssssss>

3 5 4 5 5 3 4 3		great location , be not overwhelm stay at the westin market street while travel with family .<ssssss>the hotel location be the best part of this hotel as it allow great access to the publicj transportation line .<ssssss>the cable car , street car and bus line be all step away .<ssssss>the neighborhood be also good with surround hotel include the fou season , st regis , palace hotel and the hotel palomar .<ssssss>the service be average , not overwhelming but not underwhelming .<ssssss>we breakast server be very good and attentive to we need .<ssssss>we arrive back late one night right about close time for the restaurant and we want to order dessert .<ssssss>they allow we to which be very nice and the dessert themsleve be just ok .<ssssss>i really only have 2 issue with the hotel , we stay in room 405 and for the entire stay we never have a trash can in the bathroom , only under the desk which be unusual .<ssssss>also , every night we stay the room attendant short sheet the bed by 2 inch .<ssssss>i dno ' t know if the sheet they buy be too short or if this attendant be make the bed wrong but be six foot five it become annoying to constantly rub you foot on the mattress and mattress pad .<ssssss>otherwise , the room be well maintain and clean consistently , have a great 42 inch flat tv and in room safe .<ssssss>the only other downside would be the bathroom be on the small side .<ssssss>
2 1 4 5 5 2 2 3		need serious improvement room be clean and comfortable .<ssssss>staff be average at best and be not what you should expect in 5 star hotel .<ssssss>my impression be that it be once a very good hotel which be not do very well now .<ssssss>
4 4 2 5 4 5 2 -1		a wonderful stay we have a wonderful stay at this hotel .<ssssss>the location be great , close to rue clar .<ssssss>the room be very small , but clean .<ssssss>it be a five minute walk to the eiffel tower and handy to public transportation .<ssssss>the bathroom be clean , but so tiny .<ssssss>be sure to ask for a room with a window to the street , the one in the back be a little dreary.there be wonderful cafe and market all around the hotel and two very good restaurant on the same street .<ssssss>be sure to try chez agne right next door for a very unique experience .<ssssss>also , my favorite meal be on the same side of the street at the other end at a place call la varengue , best beef bourguigonne ever!the best part of this hotel be the location .<ssssss>the only thing we find hard be it do not include breakfast and we have no access to make tea of coffee .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 4 3 3 -1		not a peaceful haven by any means we stay here over the weekend 5-9 september and be , to be frank , slightly disappointed but not surprised , have read some of the more objective review here and on other site .<ssssss>yes the hotel be conveniently located but it be far from peaceful .<ssssss>although we be upgrade to a king suite this be street face and incredibly noisy so be warn if you get a room at the front it will not be a oasis , there be construction site more or less opposite where they work all night and the traffic be incessant - on the plus side the air conditioning unit be so loud they will drown out any external noise .<ssssss>the room be not soundproof as they advertise , but we room be spacious , very clean and comfortable .<ssssss>however we have virtually no sleep for 4 night .<ssssss>as other have say , rick 's cafe be very nice but lack enough table for breakfast , there be only 4 -lrb- not really enough for 48 room -rrb- where you can sit normally otherwise you need to have you breakfast sit on settee or low chair or get down early before the business people with they laptop monopolise these table .<ssssss>the wine and cheese in the evening and all day pastry and drink be a welcome touch and the staff in there be kind and polite .<ssssss>i would also echo some other comment about the reception staff , helpful - to a point but not overly so.we eat in the associate tonus di napoli restaurant one night but unless you and you partner -lrb- s -rrb- want the same dish avoid it ; they only serve -lrb- indifferent -rrb- food for 2 or 3 people , they would not even prepare a single side salad â?it 's basically a family fast-food place with abrasive staff .<ssssss>walk a few block and there be much better place to eat .<ssssss>all in all , $ 2000 dollar -lrb- include tax -rrb- for 4 night at a standard room rate even though we be upgrade , be not value for money in this hotel and i be sure as other have state there be probably much better option .<ssssss>the minus point outweigh any good point and we would not return .<ssssss>read all trip advisor comment about this hotel - it be easy to get carry away with the effusive âPeaceful havenâ?impression that some convey .<ssssss>
1 1 2 5 3 2 3 3		unbelievable for a hotel of this suppose category truly unbelievable to be awaken by construction at 7 am.as a previous reviewer post it be outright dishonest not to advise guests.i spend $ 459 a night for a tiny room , this special wake-up call and increasinlgy indifferent service.i usually stay either at the omnus or at the regency.guess who be have my business from now on<ssssss>

1 2 1 1 3 3 4 2		you can do better .<ssssss>the bottom line be , if you want to get any sleep you should find a different hotel .<ssssss>this one be set within a few foot of a very busy road and the mattress on the bed feel like six inch of foam rubber set on a board .<ssssss>the room be tiny even by european standard .<ssssss>the room be clean enough and there be a gas station nearby if you have a rental car to fill up which we do .<ssssss>we be book at the holiday inn express the night before a flight by the company that invite we to germany .<ssssss>obviously none of they have ever stay there .<ssssss>i recommend pay more and stay at the sheraton frankfurt airport instead .<ssssss>

2 1 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		great location , small room , not great value a great location , good service -lrb- through not up to the normally high standard of other mandarin oriental hotel -rrb- , very small room for the price -lrb- though well lay out - room fine for one person would have be too small for two and be supposedly a executive suite ? -rrb-<ssssss>feel the room be too expencive for what it be much better value elsewhere in new york .<ssssss>would only stay here again if i need to be close to lincoln center and be on a tight schedule<ssssss>
4 5 5 2 5 5 5 4		great bed , nice decor stay overnight on business .<ssssss>room be on the smaller size , yet feel bigger and more luxurious - very nicely decorate -lrb- warm , modern , neutral -rrb- .<ssssss>great value business hotel , i would stay there for a city break weekend as well -lrb- might get a bit claustrophobic over a week-long stay tho -rrb- .<ssssss>friendly efficient service from desk , concierge and room service .<ssssss>the bed be one of the most comfortable hotel bed i have sleep in - soft featherb on top of firmer mattress , excellent .<ssssss>room service breakfast be just adequate for the price .<ssssss>surprise at how quiet it be give that the view from the window be of train pull in and out of london bridge rail station a couple hundred metre away .<ssssss>no sound from neighbour .<ssssss>the neighbourhood be not anything special but it be a fine place to park you bag and get a good night 's sleep , and there be good underground connection very nearby .<ssssss>
2 2 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		smile but total ineficiency first surprise : the hotel have be change because of !<ssssss>overbook !<ssssss>we -lrb- 9 people -rrb- be transfer to other melia hotel , less rate than paradisus .<ssssss>no explanation at all .<ssssss>at this hotel the room be not yet available , even they do not know we be to arrive .<ssssss>that mean 3 hour more of lobby .<ssssss>the passive behaviour of the staff be the problem .<ssssss>they say yes to everything but nobody take really care of the demand .<ssssss>desperatingly we have to arrange the transportation to paradisus the next day .<ssssss>when arrive at paradisus hotel , needless to say , the room be not yet available , so we have to wait until 4 pm to get finally to we room .<ssssss>if you want a beach chair in the shadow you have to stay at the beach before 8am .<ssssss>i expect more chair available in such a luxury hotel .<ssssss>the food be really good in almost every restaurant .<ssssss>the romantico be a must but make reservation asap .<ssssss>the staff be friendly , may be too friendly but it seem to be the caribbean way of life .<ssssss>ineficieny be unbeliveable even consider the caribbean standard .<ssssss>probably the problem be not the hotel itself but the staff lack of professionality .<ssssss>
2 3 3 4 4 2 1 3		conveniently located .<ssssss>i feel a bit mean only give it a 2 rating but i be quite disappointed .<ssssss>we have a room on the side of the building , across the street from some house .<ssssss>a typical set up for a city hotel i be sure.the room be ... small .<ssssss>it be pretty well impossible not to trip over you bag on the way to the miniscule bathroom .<ssssss>you would not want to be clostrophobic!the bed be fairly comfortable but the pillow be rock hard.bring you own shampoo , etc. as there be no bathroom complimentary .<ssssss>only one towel per person and no floor matt .<ssssss>there be a tea/coffee service but no raw sugar .<ssssss>later that night as the cold settle in i go downstairs to ask for another blanket .<ssssss>the staff be amuse at my request .<ssssss>the look they give each other seem to say we be not one of those kind of hotel .<ssssss>i be instead instruct to use the air conditioning which be ridiculous as i would not like to sleep with it on all night .<ssssss>we pile we winter coat on the bed for warmth instead.the ` sleep ' part of the hotel be attach to the original sullivan hotel -lrb- pub section -rrb- .<ssssss>we go there for dinner and be very happy !<ssssss>the service be absolutely fantastic , the food be fresh and tasty and reasonably price -lrb- we have the bean nacho and the salt and pepper squid which come with a yummy salad -rrb- .<ssssss>one thing that must be say about the sullivan hotel be that it be in a excellent location .<ssssss>you can not beat it for the price -lrb- though not cheap , fairly cheap for sydney -rrb- .<ssssss>the room be clean and it be great not to have to share a bathroom.go to the sullivan hotel for dinner and a beer and a city-sleep ; -rrb-<ssssss>
3 5 2 5 4 5 5 3		budget hotel with great location .<ssssss>room<ssssss>
3 3 4 5 5 3 3 4		not there yet .<ssssss>after stay and dine at all the 5 star hotel in hong kong over the year , i decide its time to check out the new four season hotel in hk .<ssssss>i have hear conflict comment from friend of mine who have stay at the property during the past year .<ssssss>the lobby area be kinda sparse , with not much of a focal point .<ssssss>the check in and concierge counter be off to the side and the low ceiling kinda make the area feel cramped -lrb- as the lobby have a 4 storey height to it -rrb- .<ssssss>service be quick , efficient but be cold and without much of a four season touch .<ssssss>its as if they be there to get you in and out asap ... maybe that how they want it to be see - a efficient biz type like hotel - again , this be not a four season trait .<ssssss>the other better four season that i have stay in , offer a gracious charm to it , efficient but fill with care and warmth .<ssssss>diligent attention and a open to get u what u want and beyond that , get u who u do not know u want .<ssssss>fs george v in paris do that so well .<ssssss>thats the benchmark of all four season should be compare to.room be alright , a bright blend of east and west , view be quite good , if its a clear day , otherwise , u will be look out to a grey harbor .<ssssss>the funny thing be that the apartment block next to the hotel , which i understand be also manage by the four season in hk , offer much better harbor view .<ssssss>room at the apartment block face more towards the central and causeway bay direction , while the hotel block face more towards tsim sha tsui west and the macau ferry terminal .<ssssss>if you be look for the room with the best harbor view from hong kong side , this be not it .<ssssss>the harbor view room at the grand hyatt , shangri-la , conrad offer better views.i check out the dining facility at the hotel during the stay and have dinner at both the french and chinese restaurant .<ssssss>since the executive chef at the caprice come from le cing of george v paris , i expect a great meal .<ssssss>alas , that be not the case .<ssssss>quite disappointed be my feeling .<ssssss>service be like the check in - fast and furious .<ssssss>its as if they be try to outdo each other in try to get the table turn .<ssssss>see a waiter break some glass that be place in the long glass cabinet place in the middle of the restaurant .<ssssss>the rush rush rush feel do not do it for I in a french restaurant , especially with staff from george v paris run the place .<ssssss>i speak to the manager of the restaurant and make he aware of my observation and he concur .<ssssss>he be definitely not happy with the level of service be offer .<ssssss>as for the food , i be a frequent guest at le cinq , and the food at caprice be not a true reflection of what it be in paris .<ssssss>guess something have lose itself in the translation of the cooking .<ssssss>i understand that the executive chef from le cinq visit the restarurant a while back and be quite disappointed with the level of food .<ssssss>effort have be make to rectify that problem but i still do not see it as even offer the best french fine dining in hong kong .<ssssss>gaddi 's at the pen be still the best in this aspect .<ssssss>so much for my french fine dining.the chinese restaurant be modern , silverish grey in color and a bit cold .<ssssss>just like most of the staff at the hotel , the four season touch just do not show itself .<ssssss>one thing i have notice be that many of the staff seem to be a bit distance and act cool .<ssssss>thats again , not a four season trait - cool be just not four season .<ssssss>four season be all about warmth , openess , and willingness to aid and get the guest feeling top of the world.food at the chinese restaurant come in pretty dainty size offering , do not make the dining experience that great , as i be with a group of friend that all make comment that we need to double what we order .<ssssss>guess that what management decide to go with .<ssssss>again , i be disappoint with the chinese food , as i can get much better fare at many great chinese restauratn in hong kong .<ssssss>if one need just to entertain in central , i guess fs hk be a alright choice .<ssssss>if u need to entertain with great food , this be not the place to go.the swim pool area be pretty nice -lrb- located at and angle face tsim sha tsui and wanchai -rrb- , especially at nite and desert .<ssssss>the shimmering light of hong kong harbor and kowloon be always great to check out .<ssssss>for any traveller with friend with american club membership , u should check out the nite scene of hk from the club 's city location - located in side 2 exchange square , 49th floor -rrb- .<ssssss>all in all , f hk be a middle of the road four season , with much lack befitting a city like hong kong .<ssssss>it do not come close to the other great four season around the world .<ssssss>i place it on the same level as the four season in singapore and sydney , albeit in a brand spanking new building .<ssssss>and way way behind the four season flagship , four season george v paris .<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 3 3 4		very convenient i live here quite a few time .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i know the manager because of my frequent stay so i always get good benefit .<ssssss>to tell you the truth the rooom be very bad so everytime i live here i only live in the presidential suite ... .<ssssss>it be a big big big big difference with other room , other then live in the presidential suite then there be no point living here .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but i must say the price be a great deal for other room , but room be poor .<ssssss>as you can see my other review , i say i be willing to help anyone so you can email I and i will tell you the truth about hotel .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the real face of they ...<ssssss>
4 5 2 -1 5 -1 4 -1		excellent value for money just get back after a 4 night stay at the bany orientals.the hotel be excellent value for money - right in the middle of the old town - everything be within easy reach.the hotel room be excellent - clean every day + spotless .<ssssss>i can understand some of the other review even though i would definately go back to the bany again .<ssssss>the noise from the street be not a problem at all , but as say previously the wall be very thin + if you be unlucky enough to have a very loud spanish man staying in the room next door to yours who insist on use the telephone for about a hour each night at 3.00 be -lrb- as we have for the first two night -rrb- it can be very frustrating - but that be the gamble you take - the last two night be noise free !!<ssssss>the bathroom be spotless + even though there may have be a slight smell - as soon as you walk around the old street you can tell where its come from - the drain be very bad.all in all i would definately recommend use the hotel - for the price you pay + the location it be in it be excellent - we will definately be go back !!<ssssss>
1 1 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		pathetic excuse for service my wife and i dislike this hotel so much that i don ; t want to waste too much time write about it .<ssssss>outwardly nice room , but actually very cheaply put together .<ssssss>we toilet overflow twice !!!!<ssssss>incredibly rude service on multiple occassion .<ssssss>terrible restaurant recomendation .<ssssss>ridiculously expensive breakfast and drink .<ssssss>10 euro for a beer , seriously this place be not the 4 season .<ssssss>in general highly recommend against stay there .<ssssss>if you do stay there , there be a wonderful bakery and pastry shop down the street .<ssssss>the eclair be ... mmmmm eclair !!!!<ssssss>

2 1 2 3 3 1 2 -1		nice but would not go back my boyfriend and i recently take a trip to the majestic in january .<ssssss>the resort be very nice with lush landscaping and be very clean .<ssssss>although we have a good time there be some problems.our room be not ready when we first check in which be not that big of a problem because we spend time at the bar .<ssssss>however , we be tell to come back in 30 minute and the room would be ready .<ssssss>of course we come back and then they tell we another 35 minute .<ssssss>.<ssssss>so we wait for a while for the room .<ssssss>the check-in process itself be very chaotic and the staff be just run around like chicken with they head cut off .<ssssss>the one thing we be very upset about be the fact that they have we check out a day earlier .<ssssss>thank goodness the departure bus service -lrb- which you have to register with so you can find out what time you bus be leave -rrb- notice that they have we leave the wrong day .<ssssss>well , try to correct that be hell !!!<ssssss>they keep tell we we have to prove to they that we be stay til the 31st and not the 30th ... well , that be pretty hard to do since they have we itinerary which they request when we check in .<ssssss>all in all , we be able to fix it.the pool and beach be very nice and we have no problem get towel or lounge chair ... the food be bland ... and they do not label anything at they buffet so you be constantly walk around wonder what the food actually be .<ssssss>plus , every buffet be the same .<ssssss>the only restaurant that be good be the le gourmet .<ssssss>get reservation and eat there .<ssssss>the chinese and steakhouse restaurant be decent as well.the room be ok .<ssssss>the bed be like sleep on the floor .<ssssss>the mattress be so hard .<ssssss>i have never sleep on something so hard in my life .<ssssss>the bathroom be tiny ... well the toilet area ... you feel cloisterphobic if you shut the door to use the bathroom ... the shower be big enough to fit five adult and i cant understand why they make that so big and the toilet so small .<ssssss>also , room location be key .<ssssss>we pay for a upgrade to have a pool side room , which be nice .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but beware .<ssssss>my boyfriend and i be not partier .<ssssss>we like to relax when we go away .<ssssss>it be very hard to do this at colonial majestic .<ssssss>they have wedding here daily .<ssssss>.<ssssss>which be fine during the day .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but at night , the wedding reception be hold at the pool bar which be right smack in the middle of all the room ... and of course , right in front of hour .<ssssss>so from 7pm to 12am every single night , we have to listen to loud music and holler guest .<ssssss>i mean , i be all for have fun at wedding , but this resort need to find a reception area that do not interfere with its other guest .<ssssss>i do not pay for a five star resort to hear someone wedding all night long .<ssssss>plus , you can hear the entertainment from other area of the resort as well .<ssssss>the only way for peace and quiet be to book a room by the ocean , but this resort be not worth all that money.the weather be beautiful and we enjoy relaxing by the pool everyday ... but we will never go back to majestic .<ssssss>take this review as you see fit .<ssssss>i read all review before i go and i take the positive one over the negative ... wish i didnt do that ... think about it before you book .<ssssss>

4 2 4 2 5 4 4 -1		a comfortable stay hi , i stay at holiday inn during my 3 day business trip to amsterdam .<ssssss>i be put up on the 11th floor and my window overlook the city light during night time .<ssssss>it be quite near to the schiphol airport and i be charge eur 30 for one way drop by taxi from airport .<ssssss>the hotel be well connect with public transport -lrb- station rai -rrb- by tram and metro nearby.a -rrb- room quality amenity : the room quality and amenity be quite good especially the toilet be quite neat and clean.b -rrb- room service : though i do not order much but whenever i need some amenity , they be promptly attend to by the staff .<ssssss>so there be no complaint on that end.c -rrb- staff response : i particularly like the warmth of the porter , who would traditionally guide guest at the hotel on how to go about navigate around amsterdam .<ssssss>he in fact go out of he way to printout a route map for I to reach my office destination and explain several way in which i could reduce my personal cost of stay in amsterdam.d -rrb- negative aspect # 1 : the hotel itself be a little far off from the city .<ssssss>though there be a regular tram service and a metro service to the city centraal -lrb- the centre of the city -rrb- , where most of the activity really happen , it take about 30 minute one way to reach the center of the city .<ssssss>it be certainly inconvenient to catch a tram everyday after return from office .<ssssss>one prefer not to travel much after a long hard day.e -rrb- negative aspect # 2 : this be particular to ` vegetarian -lrb- no meat no fish variety like I -rrb- ' .<ssssss>there be hardly much to eat at the restaurant of the hotel .<ssssss>also there be not any food outlet in the vicinity of the hotel where one could just walk across for have dinner or food .<ssssss>so i have to go to the city every time that i need to have vegetarian food.overall , i have a comfortable stay at hotel holiday inn but due to its distance from the city 's center , it become incovenient to travel to the city for food and sightseeing .<ssssss>i would certainly recommend this hotel to people who be there in amsterdam on business and have a short stay and want to stay nearer to the airport .<ssssss>

3 3 5 4 4 1 3 -1		poor first impression we stay here from the 10th january for 3 night and the last leg of we honeymoon.we have travel from fijus to auckland , sit in auckland airport all day then have a 12 hour flight to san francisco .<ssssss>we breeze through we immigration and we case be there as we approach the carousel .<ssssss>outside a cab be ready to take we to the vitale , we arrive there within a hour of touch down , to be great by a member of staff who clearly have more important customer than we , she simply tell we that we room be not ready and that nothing could be guarenteed before 3.00 pm , it be currently 12.30 .<ssssss>after a long journey i expect a better welcome , afterall the hotel know which flight you be on and when to expect you .<ssssss>for a hotel which be aspire to great thing this attitude be something fundamental which need to be address .<ssssss>in a country which be well know for it be customer focussed service we be a bit disappointed to be greet by this attitude.i ask if we could wait with a drink in reception , the answer be no!luckily another staff member intervene and , although he do not tell we anything different he manner be more acceptable .<ssssss>we be offer a room a the 4th floor or , a hour later , we room on the 7th floor would ready , we wait the extra hour in the bar.room be ok , a partial bridge view although i be expect a habour front room , it be comfortable enough and the bed linen be excellent , the room be not as big as i be expect either.after a long day we opt for room service in the evening which be very good .<ssssss>we eat in the americano on we last evening which be buzz with a afterwork crowd , the restuarant too be busy , the wine list be good and the food be very good .<ssssss>we eat in one market the evening before and to be honest even though it be more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the americano , there be nothing wrong with the americano just that one market just give that little bit more for you dollar.we would stay there again as the hotel , bar and restuarant be all very good lively place , it be just a shame that in the last place of we honeymoon we be greet by such a abrasive staff member , maybe she should look for a career which be not customer face .<ssssss>

1 1 2 4 2 1 1 -1		awful hotel , would never recommend i have never have such a negative experience at a hotel as i do when we stay two night at the normandie .<ssssss>i would never recommend this hotel to anyone , and strongly caution anyone from stay there.our first impression of the hotel be good , the lobby be nice and very art-deco .<ssssss>however , we be disgust when we open the door to we room .<ssssss>there be little tiny bug crawl all over surface in the room , rust on anything metal in the room , and paint be chip off the wall .<ssssss>we shower look like it have not be clean , as there be some kind of liquid -lrb- look like body wash -rrb- drizzle down the side of the bath tub .<ssssss>the toilet only flush when you hold down the handle for ten seconds and even then a lot of time you have to flush twice .<ssssss>in the morning there be no hot water and we take cold shower two morning in a row .<ssssss>when we open we blind to look out the window , we discover dirty kleenex behind the blind .<ssssss>it be absolutely disgusting .<ssssss>for the money we pay , we expect a four star hotel as they claim they be .<ssssss>i would have classify it a 2 star.the gross room be not the least of we problem at the normandie , though .<ssssss>we have book we stay for two night over the phone and be give a confirmation number .<ssssss>we have re-confirm that reservation just 3 day before arrive , and everything be set .<ssssss>however , on the second night at about 5:00 , we receive a call from the front desk tell we we need to check out immediately or face a $ 50 late check out fee .<ssssss>i argue and say we have a reservation for 2 night , but since i have no proof other than the confirmation number , they continue to insist i check out , as they have no availability for that night .<ssssss>i ask to speak to the manager several time , but he refuse to speak with I .<ssssss>one time he come out of he office , look at I , say something to the front desk clerk in spanish , and then walk back into the office .<ssssss>i think that be the most ridiculous thing i have ever see , i could not believe a manager refuse to talk to a guest .<ssssss>remarkably they find a room , but i have to pay twice what we regular rate be for it .<ssssss>i be absolutely livid , but we do not have a choice at that point and have to pay the rate in order to have a place to stay that night .<ssssss>be a experienced traveler , i have a feeling that they do not want to honor we discounted rate for that night and decide to con we into pay more .<ssssss>we travel agent tell we that happen a lot in mexico and the caribbean , so i would bet that be what happen .<ssssss>so moral to the story : if you book over the phone , always get something additional in print!our nightmare continue that second night when the hotel host a pre-new year eve party for the local -lrb- i would bet only about 10 % of the hotel guest actually go to the party -rrb- .<ssssss>we be give no notification about this when we make the reservation or at check-in other than that the restaurant would be close for set it up .<ssssss>what be ridiculous be that they host it in the atrium , and the hotel be set up so that all floor of the hotel look down into the atrium , so the noise travel up .<ssssss>there be hundred of people there which be loud enough , but then the band start play at 10:00 and go until 1:15 am .<ssssss>they have to have have the speaker on the loudest possible volume .<ssssss>we be on the third floor and we furniture be vibrate .<ssssss>it be perhaps the most inconsiderate thing i have ever see a hotel do .<ssssss>the purpose of a hotel be to have a place to sleep , and how could anyone sleep when there be a band blaring .<ssssss>i be particularly upset because we have to get up early the next morning .<ssssss>when i call to complain , the front desk clerk be rude and just tell I the music will be off by 1:00 , which should give you plenty of rest .<ssssss>it be not off by 1 , though ... the band keep play encore and then people hang around in the atrium after that and the noise still come up into we room.when we check out the next day i complain again about the noise but be not give any apology or compensation .<ssssss>overall the room be gross , the customer service be awful , and it seem to be a very corrupt hotel .<ssssss>it be extremely over price , yet i do not think even if it be cheaper i would ever recommend the normandie .<ssssss>this hotel be truly a nightmare experience .<ssssss>

2 2 2 3 5 2 3 3		mixed feeling about the novotel montparnasse my wife and i , together with we 2 year old daughter , stay at this hotel on two seperate occasion each of one night in late september and early october -lrb- on the way to and from a holiday in the south of france -rrb- .<ssssss>i book the hotel via they website and order a cot for we daughter .<ssssss>my booking this hotel be base on read good review from other visitors.on arrival we impression be mix .<ssssss>the location be reasonable , but even though it be close to the departure end of montparnasse sncf station , the metro be a very lengthy 20 minute walk from the hotel through a packed station .<ssssss>also , it be not on the rer line so travel across paris to gare du nord can take about half a hour , not include the walk from hotel to metro.the receptionist be very much the pushy salesman , butter we up by offer we daughter a cuddly toy and then give she two -lrb- even though he give two to every child ! -rrb-<ssssss>, then push they loyalty card on we with a big sale pitch about it all .<ssssss>it take age to just check in and get to we room when we be all very tired.on both occasion there be no cot in the room and none forthcoming when ask , despite have book this in advance.the website give the impression that the hotel be very child friendly and that there be a play area in the hotel for young child , however , there be no such play area.the room be small with not that much storage space for clothes , but luckily we be only stay one night.we be tell on the website that there be unlimited tea and coffee , but find in the room just one sachet of coffee and one very small sachet of milk , not even enough for one person to have one drink !<ssssss>also , the cup be two of the most revolting plastic container i have ever see ; i do not even realise they be cup at first !<ssssss>not what one expect from this class of hotel , especially as stay in a mercure -lrb- supposedly a lower class of hotel -rrb- in calais the night before we have a lot of coffee sachet and very nice real mugs.the novotel also have no minibar , just a small bottle of water in the fridge.there be wifus in the room but a payable service .<ssssss>there be a terminal in the lobby that be free to use for twenty minute at a time.the one good thing about the hotel be the breakfast , which be vary , with cereal , fruit , cold meat , bacon , egg and sausage etc. , although no better than any other hotel we have stay in .<ssssss>it do cost 16 euro each though!all in all we be not that impressed and will not stay there again , or in a novotel .<ssssss>it just be not up to the standard one would expect from that class of hotel charge the high rate we pay for each night .<ssssss>there be also better located hotel nearer the rer line as well as the metro if you want to enjoy paris and get round quickly .<ssssss>the location be fine for we as we be travel from montparnasse sncf station the next morning.all in all , mixed feeling and not as great for family as other review make out .<ssssss>
5 5 4 5 4 5 4 2		excellent location , low price the hotel be in a excellent location and perfect for anyone young , single , and travel alone .<ssssss>yes , the room be as tiny as all the review say , but you can not beat the location .<ssssss>and really , how much time do you actually spend in the room.the hotel staff be courteous .<ssssss>although the restaurant next door can not compete with san francisco 's finest , annabelle 's be great for a quick meal at the end of a long day .<ssssss>

4 3 5 3 5 3 4 -1		nice hotel with many amenity we stay here for 5 night to celebrate we 5th wedding anniversary .<ssssss>we be upgrade from a city view to a garden view room , which be on the 6th floor so you could see the ocean too .<ssssss>the room be a good size with a flat screen tv , separate couch/sitting area , fridge , plenty of counter space in the bathroom , and a small balcony .<ssssss>the bed be really comfortable .<ssssss>the ac unit like most everywhere i have stay kick on a off all night .<ssssss>there be no noise by the pool at night -lrb- i have be concern about this -rrb- and very quiet in the hall , no noise from other rooms.check in-our room be not ready until after 3 , which be a pain b/c we get there at 10:30 , not the hotel 's fault by any stretch and they do offer we the hospitality suite if we want to change.one recommendation i would have would be for the hotel to invest in a couple of inexpensive chair to fit on the balcony , it would really increase the experience to be able sit outside with coffee in the am , or ` apre beach ' to watch the sunset .<ssssss>the hotel surprise we with a bottle of champagne and chocolate cover strawberry with a lovely note from irene , the guest relation manager whom i correspond with prior to we visit .<ssssss>that be a really nice touch.the beach be great .<ssssss>i think the umbrella should just be include in the cost of the room .<ssssss>for we they be a must as we be not use to the hot hot sun .<ssssss>sometimes they would run out of towel if you go down late afternoon .<ssssss>but no rush to get chair etc. the pool area be beautiful , we do not use the pool though , as we like the beach better .<ssssss>the beach could get windy sometimes to the point of be sandblast .<ssssss>the water be beautifully warm , and no seaweed .<ssssss>the beach be clean and it be great to have the little cafe/bar right there , though expensive !!<ssssss>sticker shock even though i be warn .<ssssss>it give one pause to order a bunch of frozen drink all day !<ssssss>nice mellow bar with friendly staff .<ssssss>we only eat at the cafe -lrb- a ok pizza -rrb- , and al fredo for a appetizer of prosciutto and melon .<ssssss>breakfast be really only the expensive buffet , we sit at the bar for a couple of coffee that run $ 10 .<ssssss>if you get off campus we eat at metropol twice , great down home cuban/puerto rican food .<ssssss>mi casita for breakfast once , ok , but not great service from we waitress who insist on give we american coffee when we want it puerto rican style .<ssssss>we also eat mexican at lupi 's , it be ok.taxi 's as other have say expensive , $ 25 w/tip to old san juan .<ssssss>do not use the spa .<ssssss>gamble a bit , small casino , but you can get a $ 5 blackjack table and not as intimidate as some of the larger casino if you be not a big gambler.i guess if i be not sound overly enthused it be because i discover i really like smaller hotel .<ssssss>we also do not rent a car , so while everything you really need be right at the hotel , it can cost a small fortune .<ssssss>for a family vacation i do not see how it could be affordable if you only stay on campus .<ssssss>the area outside the hotel be urban .<ssssss>we walk around a bit to check out some of the other hotel .<ssssss>the walgreen only have two aisle open , the supermarket seem like it be ready to close down too .<ssssss>the mall be definitely not a mall , just a few stores-not that we be look for a mall , but in case someone be !<ssssss>overall i find it a perfectly acceptable nice place to stay , nice lobby area , gorgeous pool , beach , restaurant , spa , casino , bar .<ssssss>a pretty mellow ` scene ' , unlike the el san juan which be very glitzy .<ssssss>but i would stay in a different area next time .<ssssss>oh and the plane nearby be no problem .<ssssss>

4 5 4 4 4 5 4 2		a nice find stay in the hotel for 3 night in august .<ssssss>its situate between 3 metro station so its pretty easy to reach from wherever you be apart from the airport -lrb- cdg -rrb- which be slightly trickier .<ssssss>to start with the reception be always staff and they always greet you when you arrive with a smile .<ssssss>all the staff we meet speak good english and be very helpful .<ssssss>we never eat there at the hotel so i can not comment on that.the room be a-bit odd and look as though it have be two room some time ago but this wouldnât be a problem .<ssssss>the bed be nice ; a lot of closet space and bath room be also very nice .<ssssss>
2 1 4 -1 4 -1 1 -1		awful cost/quality rate this be one of the symbol of san francisco , as many person of the place tell we .<ssssss>yes , its saloon be opulent and really wonderful but there be many bad thing , especially think of the incredible price you can pay for such kind of hotel .<ssssss>first , the service be incredibly awful and you would expect something wonderful in that level of hotel .<ssssss>we be completely astonish by the afternoon tea we have : the price be quite high but more importantly , we ask for one bottle of champagne -lrb- of course very high price -rrb- and the smell and the taste be really awful .<ssssss>we then ask the waiter to change the bottle and he could not even understand what we be say and he have to call the manager to do that !<ssssss>-lrb- in every little osteria in italy you would immediately get a new bottle without any comment ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the room be elegant but we really think that the hotel do not deserve the price .<ssssss>go there just if somebody else be pay for you !<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 2 -1		the dirtiest hotel i have ever stay in this hotel be dirty , in need of urgent renovation .<ssssss>the bathroom be moldy , the decor be very tired and goodness know what be grow in the air vent .<ssssss>the comb supply by the hotel be useful for jam in the wardrobe door to keep the light off .<ssssss>the reception staff be not particularly interested in any of we concern about the hygiene standard of the room .<ssssss>i would not recommend this hotel to anyone .<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 5 2 2 4		good location , clean modern hotel a pleasant , modern hotel in a good location for all the barcelona sight and the paula sant jordi .<ssssss>right outside the paral-lel metro station if you do not want to walk.lot 's of cheap place to eat in the local area - beware that barcelona have become a tourist trap and some place be very expensive .<ssssss>lot of petty crime too , but this hotel be in no worse a area than any other.pro 's - nice clean modern room , cheap for the quality , free wi-fus , good view over the hill , good transport links.con 's - not a friendly reception , night porter do not speak much english , the pool be deceptive on the picture - i have see bigger jacuzzis!overall , a bargain quality hotel .<ssssss>
2 1 3 -1 3 2 1 1		not what we think it would be ... .<ssssss>we be really look forward to we san francisco vacation and it really be a perfect weekend - except for the hotel .<ssssss>when you think of a 5 star hotel you think service , luxury and proximity .<ssssss>hmmm ... the jw marriott do not even reach 5 star quality in any of these area .<ssssss>while the room be spacious they be completely outdate .<ssssss>it take room service over a hour to get to we and they act as if i do something wrong .<ssssss>the concierge -lrb- kyle ? -rrb-<ssssss>be completely off the mark when recommend restaurant .<ssssss>sound like it be more base on a kick back than anything else b/c he send we to some young kid bar at 50 year old !!<ssssss>check in be just fine except for the check out part .<ssssss>you feel as if they could not wait to be rid of two people who make absolutely no trouble .<ssssss>i would never stay in a marriott again - all b/c of this place .<ssssss>awful , awful , awful ...<ssssss>
2 3 2 4 5 4 3 -1		mercure ginza hotel this hotel be located in the central ginza district of tokyo .<ssssss>the room be small , the bathroom be small , storage space be minimal and the step up into the bathroom in some room be about 50cm -lrb- not good for the elderly -rrb- .<ssssss>the area be nice , with interesting food hall a however the shopping be expensive and mainly include western or european brand .<ssssss>also , language can be a real problem with many menu and sign write only in hiragana or kanji .<ssssss>language be a positive for the hotel , as they have a number of english-speaking staff on hand .<ssssss>the view from many hotel room be non-existent .<ssssss>also , the room i stay in be poorly lay out with a chair block access to part of the room .<ssssss>the breakfast be ok , but do not have a huge variety when it come to choice .<ssssss>the hotel also do not have any leisure facility like a pool or a gym , which be a shame.overall , i would say the mercure ginza hotel be reasonable , but do not go there expect too much .<ssssss>

3 3 4 -1 5 -1 2 -1		good but very business orientate we like this hotel though i find it a bit cold and the service not very good so we would not stay there again.decor be modern and the room be nice - very very nice bathroom in fact.breakfast be expensive but excellent quality.the place just feel too anonymous - there be mix-up at breakfast every day when my partner and i do not arrive at exactly the same time , and we get either double-charge or not charge at all , as they could not grasp the fact that we be together even when i try to explain .<ssssss>and there never seem to be a barman in the lobby , and no one to look out for whether people might want a drink .<ssssss>staff at reception be coolly efficient but that be absolutely the limit of what they would offer.on the other hand , it be comfortable and a very good location .<ssssss>
2 3 2 4 4 4 5 2		good hotel , a few gripe the sofitel layfayette square be a very elegant hotel .<ssssss>the place be very clean , the room and particularly the bathroom be beautifully design and decorate .<ssssss>the bed be some of the best i have ever sleep on .<ssssss>the staff be exceptionally polite and helpful .<ssssss>nonetheless , i do not think i will stay here again , for a few reason that be mostly the result of my own relatively minor gripe about what make a hotel stay comfortable for I .1 -rrb- many room face alleyway .<ssssss>it seem like at least a quarter of the room face a dark alleyway in the back of the hotel .<ssssss>there be another building across this alleyway , so when the curtain be open , you be literally on display to the office worker in this other building .<ssssss>further , this alleyway be busy with delivery and trash removal fairly constantly , so there be quite a bit of noise .<ssssss>lastly , this alleyway be blindingly illuminate at night .<ssssss>in short , the shades of you room need to be draw pretty much 24 hour a day .2 -rrb- no thermostat in room .<ssssss>i tend to like my room on the cold side , and my guess be the room be keep at about 75 degree , night and day , which make it pretty stuffy for I .3 -rrb- no coffee in the room .<ssssss>i tend to need coffee right when i wake up , and there be no coffee pot in the room .<ssssss>there be free coffee in the lobby , which mean you have to make yourself at least somewhat presentable before you venture downstairs .4 -rrb- no free wireless .<ssssss>wireless internet access be $ 5.99 per day .<ssssss>it be provide by t-mobile , and require you fill out a lengthy form and provide you credit card number .<ssssss>my first complaint be just bad luck .<ssssss>2-4 be the reason i probably will choose another hotel next time .<ssssss>even discount hotel provide thermostat , in-room coffee and free wireless , so i be fairly surprised that these amenity be not available at the sofitel .<ssssss>
2 4 4 3 4 1 2 3		great hotel , shame about the staff hotel be very nice - quite newly build with a very modern design.unusual or modern bathroom layout depend on you perspective.brown glass slide door to bath/shower / toilet / bidet - whole wall make of glass .<ssssss>not exactly see through - but enough so you could see if some one be sit on the loo .<ssssss>a distinct lack of privacy !<ssssss>wash hand basin out side of this glass area.had breakfast once - food be very goodonly problem be the staff - reception staff be very very slow to do anything - appear disinterested in help we / check we in or out etc. no-one say hello / good bye as we enter or leave hotel - even when we say it ourself .<ssssss>no rush at all - which can be very frustration when all you want to do be check in!a little isolate - easy taxi ride to port vell / olympic.i suggest the tourist bus - get you to the main area overall all i would stay there again , at a push , but would have a low expectation of reception !!<ssssss>
5 3 5 -1 3 -1 5 -1		best place i have ever stay this be easily the best place i have stay ever .<ssssss>the surroundings be not too glamorous but once you be inside it be a piece of paradise .<ssssss>the villa be surround by wall and each have its own pool .<ssssss>the villa be on two level and be not large but be everything you will need .<ssssss>each villa have a kitchen outside and the staff cook breakfast for you each morning at the time of you choosing .<ssssss>the shower be also outside which be briefly disconcert until you realise that you can not be see .<ssssss>there be a spa next door to the villa which be very showy -lrb- worth see once -rrb- but for much less you can get something better at another hotel .<ssssss>

2 4 3 -1 2 -1 2 -1		call to confirm you room request ahead of time !!<ssssss>i book this hotel through expedia , and request a non-smoking room .<ssssss>when i check in , the manager on duty say to I , unfortunately , we do not have any non-smoking room available .<ssssss>i have not mention anything to he about it , so i figure he must have see my reservation request .<ssssss>i say , but i specifically request a non-smoking room , and he say , yes , and we try to honor those request , but we can not guarantee they if people check in before you who have also request non-smoking .<ssssss>later , as he be finish my paperwork , he say , again , i be sorry , we just do not get you request from expedia .<ssssss>if we have get it , we would have honor it .<ssssss>now i be piss ... because this be a flat-out lie .<ssssss>he obviously forget that he be the one who first bring up the subject , and that the only way he could have know i want non-smoking , be because he see it on the reservation request .<ssssss>the best he could do be offer to move I to a non-smoking room for we second night.smoking room : it be terrible .<ssssss>it not only smell heavily of stale smoke , but also of stale urine -lrb- even my husband , a former smoker could not stand it -rrb- .<ssssss>the room decor be old and like a cheap motel -lrb- for example , the tv be not inside a wooden armoire , but be perch on top of a pole that be screw into the floor . -rrb-<ssssss>i have to put a t-shirt over my pillow just to sleep because the pillow stank of smoke .<ssssss>i keep wake up cough because of the condition of the room .<ssssss>thankfully , the next night we be move to a non-smoking room.non-smoking room : this room be a completely different class of room , and be more like what i be expect from the internet picture .<ssssss>it be newer , have nice dark furniture -lrb- tv be inside of a armoire -rrb- , it be bigger , clean , it smell fresh , and be a great deal .<ssssss>if i could have stay in this room for the entire stay , and have never see that other room , i would have rate this hotel above average .<ssssss>the place really be in a nice location -lrb- walk distance to prudential center , the t , and great restaurants/shopping -rrb- , and you can not beat have free parking in downtown boston !<ssssss>the price be really excellent , but before stay there again , i would call and confirm any and all room request , or else you might get stick in that pit of a room we have .<ssssss>

2 2 4 4 4 2 1 -1		positive this property be the only negative during a 2 week west coast vacation .<ssssss>negative : book in april online directly with hotel for a 2-day stay in june + call hotel a couple of time before arrival .<ssssss>arrive at 8 pm on confirm date to discover we do not have a room .<ssssss>the clerk -lrb- owner 's daughter ? -rrb-<ssssss>be surprise to see we and all , but admit she have give we room away - despite the confirmation !<ssssss>turn out there be a gay pride celebration that weekend and room be in demand .<ssssss>she be apologetic and say she have to try to reconfirm we reservation earlier that day -lrb- call we home number , but we be already enroute -rrb- .<ssssss>we suspect since it be late evening , she do not think we would show and expect to get double payment -lrb- we confirm rate plus whatever the new tenant pay -rrb- .<ssssss>she do make other arrangement for we , however , at a low rent motel in a seedy part of town at a higher rate ... it be a bit scary , but we be tired and need a bed .<ssssss>positive : she promise we 2nd night be still reserve and would be wait .<ssssss>we choose to be optimistic and return .<ssssss>the room be huge , very comfortable and clean .<ssssss>it be a great place to stay !<ssssss>we would have rate this hotel excellent if we room have not be give away the first night .<ssssss>in 20 year of travel , we have never experience this so please be forewarn that you be take some risk when make a reservation here.note : when travel on the west coast , always confirm the hotel be air condition if that be important to you .<ssssss>many hotel do not have a/c because the night tend to be cool and you can open the window , but it be not very safe so you end up sleep in a stuffy room .<ssssss>happy travels !<ssssss>
4 2 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		not a bad choice stay in the hotel for 3 night over the weekend .<ssssss>overall i be impressed - room be big and spotless , service be friendly and efficient , and value be good .<ssssss>we get a 3 night for the price of 2 deal on expedia which mean it be under 300 euro for a double -lrb- exclude breakfast -rrb- .<ssssss>only downside be that everything extra be horrendously expensive - 25 euro for continental breakfast , 10.50 euro for gin and tonic , 13 euro for a sandwich .<ssssss>there be bar and restaurant just outside so they prove to be the best bet for eat out!it have a gym and pool that cost a extra 10 euro.location be great for the football , 5 min walk from camp nou , also 5 mi walk to maria christina underground , and bus stop outside .<ssssss>tour bus stop at camp nou so also handy if you want to do that.would recommend to other , but do not eat or drink in hotel !<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 5 -1 4 -1		resort be beautiful , but not ever go back .<ssssss>another of the beach<ssssss>
2 1 3 2 4 2 3 4		secret excellence be not excellent !<ssssss>i want to start off this review by state that although i do expect a certain level of quality and service when travel i be by no mean a vacation snob .<ssssss>i be picky but not a snob .<ssssss>this be my second time in the dr. the first time we -lrb- hubby and i -rrb- stay at iberostar bavaro in nov 2004 and you can read we review at -lsb- -- -rsb- we be the 14th review down so we have a basis of comparison and think we know what to expect .<ssssss>we stay for 4 nights/5 days.overall iâm go to state right up front we think this resort be no where near a 5 star/6 golden apple resort .<ssssss>after be to other 5 star resort -lrb- iberostar in the dr , atlantis in the bahama , aruba , etc -rrb- this be somewhere around a 3 .<ssssss>my suggestion for anyone book at this hotel now or look to book be to contact you travel agent or tour rep and if you buy insurance switch !<ssssss>itâs free to switch and the only cost be any cost difference from you package to the one youâre switching tooâ?since youâve pay for a 5 star resort in most case it will either cost the same or be just a few dollar to switch .<ssssss>no amount of adult only exclusiveness can cover the thing that just arenât 5 star quality and make this vacation less than enjoyable .<ssssss>trust I switch now!let I also state that i book my travel after read another review with judy and marie travel -lrb- just do a search and you will find they -rrb- .<ssssss>this be by far the best decision about this trip that we make .<ssssss>if you be think of travel to the dr and be plan to use a travel agent i would highly recommend themâ?heck even if you werenât plan on use a agent i would still recommend use they .<ssssss>youâll get the same price and probably much better service at you hotel.drive : we get a private transfer instead of ride the bus .<ssssss>we figure with it already be a hour away a private van would be faster than take the busâ?we be right .<ssssss>the drive there be awful as we driver feel compel to race any car/bus/truck in front of we regardless of how far away it be .<ssssss>also it be very bumpy and terribly scary as there be plenty of pot hole and hill .<ssssss>they be build a new highway which i hope will make the drive through to the resort more pleasant.check in/out : my bil book a swim-out excellence room however when we book we just pay for the regular garden view room .<ssssss>when we arrive i be pleasantly surprise that the manager have arrange for we to receive a free upgrade to the excellence club because of maria and judy .<ssssss>i have ask maria to request a 3rd floor room as i have read those be nice and again they deliver .<ssssss>the only issue be that because we didnât arrive with the other bus we have to wait about 10 minute until a excellence rep come to get we to walk we to the club to check in.excellence club : although a very nice touch and a great perk i would never ever pay the $ 70ish a day it cost to actually participate in this unless you really need internet access while on vacation .<ssssss>room : these be fairly nice .<ssssss>we be on the third floor , as request , and i be please to find out that they have elevator as i sprained my ankle just before come .<ssssss>each room have a sink/dressing area , a separate water closet/shower room , and a jacuzzi tub .<ssssss>the bed be definitely hard as rock .<ssssss>the room be always clean , no bug , and the maid service be very nice .<ssssss>we have turn down service which be a nice little extra .<ssssss>the only complaint here be that the minibar isnât a actual refrigerator but more like a high end cooler .<ssssss>so if you open it often by the end of the day everything would be warm .<ssssss>for a five star resort you would think they could get actual minus fridge .<ssssss>also because we be on the third floor we room never cool down to where we like it but it be pleasant and workable .<ssssss>oh and make sure you keep the little do not disturb card in you outlet thingy at all times.resort : beautiful grounds .<ssssss>they have a nice little wildlife area and amazingly enough most of the animal stay within that area .<ssssss>we see a stray chicken by the pool area where we stay but thatâs about it .<ssssss>we do see plenty of lizard which be cute .<ssssss>the best part of this resort be that there be covered walkway throughout the whole resort and you can walk around from the main lobby to you room and other important part of the resort without get wet on the few day it rain .<ssssss>this resort be much smaller than iberostar but just as lovely .<ssssss>the bug here however be another story and if you do come to secret bring bug spray .<ssssss>i spray daily and be fine until the last night when i run out and the next day be scratch like crazy.pool : secret have two pool .<ssssss>although we see the cascade pool since it be on the other side of the hotel we didnât swim there .<ssssss>we mostly stay in the big pool -lrb- actually two pool since itâs cut in the middle but a little rock wall -rrb- which run most of the way horizontally along the beach and resort .<ssssss>the pool be lovely and we be very pleased to see king size bed with mild cover along pool as well as chaise lounge .<ssssss>the pool be about 4.33 ft deep everywhere which be great for everyone except I as iâm 5 foot even and have to stay on my toe the whole time in the water .<ssssss>the blue floaty be hard to find mid day as people state but we get there early and stay late so we didnât have a problem .<ssssss>i must say i donât understand why they donât have more of they .<ssssss>obviously they be at a premium and honestly for a 5 star resort they should have at least one per room available .<ssssss>the swim up bar be nice but we mostly stay on the other end and just have the lovely lady who circle the area bring we drink .<ssssss>my biggest complaint about the pool be that if you be short like i be get in and out of the pool be difficult .<ssssss>stair be located throughout the pool area but be space so far apart that i have to walk , on tippy toe , probably over 25 foot from where we be to the closest staircase .<ssssss>the only walk in access be on the far left side of the pool .<ssssss>not a big deal unless you really need to use the lady room .<ssssss>this basically cause to I to stay out of the pool most of the day.beach : very pretty but very rough .<ssssss>if you be use to the east coast water , like ocean city , md , then this be pretty similar to high tide .<ssssss>the only difference be that because the water be knee deep so far out the wave be break several time and cause a huge rip current .<ssssss>we be beach people and love to play in the wave but even we find it a tad rough.nightlife : the casino , where we spend most of we time , be probably twice the size of the iberostar .<ssssss>although it have a crap table it be never open which disappoint my husband .<ssssss>we mostly play blackjack and roulette and have a very nice time .<ssssss>this casino get pretty busy at night and honestly be lot of fun .<ssssss>however as the brochure from the hotel state beware of the keno game .<ssssss>they suck you in by give you a free turn to start but itâs a loosing game and we never see anyone leave win at this game all 4 night we play there but see several people loose hundred if not thousand of dollar .<ssssss>we try to catch two show but honestly unless you show up 30-40 minute before the show start youâll never find a seat where you have a good view and can hear well .<ssssss>what we see be okay and probably good give where you be .<ssssss>this isnât vega and we never expect a vegas show but the sound quality could be improve .<ssssss>also show start at 10pm be a little lateâ ust my opinion .<ssssss>we never go to the disco as it didnât open till 11pm and honestly be quite a walk.food : the food here be just plain terrible !!!<ssssss>i donât know a single person at the resort that i speak with that think the food be any where near a 5 star resort .<ssssss>my friend just get back from the secret in mexico where they canât stop rave about the restaurant and such and all i can say be that i wish there be even a mcdonald around because that would have at least be better .<ssssss>iâve be to dr before and other caribbean island so i certain understand that we arenât in the we but the food here be just plain bad .<ssssss>forget lack of flavor it be just poor quality .<ssssss>breakfast be by far the best meal -lrb- carlo the omelet guy be great -rrb- but in general even breakfast wasnât that great .<ssssss>we try the italian and steak restaurant .<ssssss>we want to try to french restaurant but there be a two hour wait the first night we try and it be close the second night we want to go and since they donât let you know ahead of time which day it close itâs hard to plan you time wisely .<ssssss>the best meal be the beach party because you could actually see they cook the meat and try to pick out the best cut that werenât cook to a crisp .<ssssss>the fact that you can eat at any restaurant when ever you want be a nice touch if you donât mind wait over a hour to eat at some of these place since they wonât take reservation .<ssssss>i understand the benefit of not have you have to make reservation but you should be allow to make they if you choose tooâ?it would make dinner time more enjoyable for most people .<ssssss>every day they have a special on the beach but it be locate so far away from the pool that you have to get dress to go and who want to be botheredâ?another point that bug meâ?you need to get dress to eat lunch because all the restaurant be away from the pool and the snack shack by the pool be nasty !<ssssss>i honestly could go on and on about the food but i will just say that the reason we choose to stay at secret this time be because when we be here two year ago people say how great the food and resort be in comparison to iberostar -lrb- and food be we only issue with iberostar -rrb- .<ssssss>maybe two year ago it be but now itâs at best mediocre food .<ssssss>absolutely not like a 5 star resort should be and unlike the iberostar where there be plenty of decent food around just everything be bland here the food wasnât always fresh , be not of good quality , and honestly there wasnât a great selection .<ssssss>yes we never leave hungry , per se , but we never feel like we eat well.dress code : this truly tick I off about the resort .<ssssss>they claim resort casual in most restaurant and i specifically packed nice clothing for this very reason .<ssssss>i hate dress up and would have love to wear shorts and comfy shirt the whole time but i understand that this wasnât go to work here .<ssssss>my husband be a polo and jeans guy and be tell no jeans .<ssssss>we be both very upset to not only see people wear flip flop in the restaurant but some man be even wear shorts .<ssssss>all this would have be fine if there wasnât such a big deal in all the brochure about the dress code.bar : iâm russian and shoot vodka frequently at family gathering .<ssssss>if that be real stolyâs they be serve out of they stolyâs bottle iâve get some ocean front property in arizona to sell you .<ssssss>the drink be either too light on the alcohol or too much alcohol and there be absolutely no way you will convince I that they have top shelf alcohol in the bottles.service : maid and room service be great !<ssssss>the lady walk around the pool to get we drink be great !<ssssss>the wait staff in the restaurant be terrible !<ssssss>ask for a diet coke and itâs like ask for diamondsâ?in fact we start ask for the bottle in addition to glass of ice because it take over 20 minute to get we first round of sodaâs never mind a refill .<ssssss>when we would ask for the bottle we would get look of sheer panic from the staff like the management would fire they for even consider give we the bottle .<ssssss>it be easier to get wine but anything that have to be mix by a bar tender or bring from the bar take forever .<ssssss>i think the biggest problem here be that most people we see be tip the staff regardless of service and tip often .<ssssss>so the staff be use to the tip and honestly didnât work to get they .<ssssss>we stop tip after the first day and the service didnât get any worse .<ssssss>i know that these people be overwork .<ssssss>i know the long hour they put in .<ssssss>but i also know that i be at a different resort with the same condition two year ago and receive service that be 1000 time better than hereâ?enough said.overall as i say this resort be possibly a 3 star probably less .<ssssss>if youâve never be to another 5 star beach resort you might think that this be a great resort because itâs get the general feel but itâS not !<ssssss>yes itâs beautiful .<ssssss>yes itâs relaxing .<ssssss>yes it feel like paradise .<ssssss>but itâs not 5 star .<ssssss>if this be you first trip out of the we and to the dr do not judge all beach vacation against this resort because you get so much more for the same money at other resort .<ssssss>for the money dr be one of the nicer island in term of value iâve travel too .<ssssss>the value be amazing .<ssssss>however i will never stay at this resort again .<ssssss>next time iâll go with what i knowâ?iâll go back to iberostar!if you have any question feel free to contact I at rinibini@aol.com .<ssssss>make sure that you put âSecrets vacation questionâ?in the subject line .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 5 3 3 2		a pleasant surprise !<ssssss>i have never stay at a club quarte before , and be slightly wary of the budget accomodation , but need a place for one night so i take a chance .<ssssss>i be very pleased with my choice .<ssssss>it be located on a side street in a old building very near faneuil hall , quincey market , and the aquarium .<ssssss>check in be do by machine -lrb- a first for I -rrb- but there be someone at the desk 24/7 to help if need .<ssssss>the lobby be small but nice and there be a large club room open to all adjacent to it that be plush and comfortable .<ssssss>the hallway be narrow as be typical in this type of building .<ssssss>my room be smallish -lrb- although i have be in much smaller room ! -rrb-<ssssss>, cute , and very well appoint .<ssssss>it be very cleverly design to make the most of the space and to soundproof the wall of adjoining room .<ssssss>everything -lrb- tv , microwave , phone , bed -rrb- seem fairly new .<ssssss>i love the self serve water bottle bar in the hallway .<ssssss>the next morning i be able to leave my bag for $ 1/bag while i roam around .<ssssss>i arrive late in the evening after the kitchen in the adjoining restaurant close and there be no other nearby restaurant which do not upset I much but would certainly present a problem for the hungry or those with kid .<ssssss>the wireless be not work the night i be there which be a disappointment to I .<ssssss>some reviewer have comment on the noise but to I it be just big city noise ; come from sf i be not bother .<ssssss>i do occasionally hear a noise from the hallway that i might not have hear in a larger or newer establishment but the price and charm of this hotel far outweigh any negative .<ssssss>
3 2 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		i beg to disagree - not the 5 * experience i have expect .<ssssss>the exterior<ssssss>
2 3 4 -1 2 -1 1 -1		good and bad point , especially for family my husband and two young kid and i stay here over the memorial day weekend .<ssssss>we kid love the hotel - they enjoy the pool , the room size and the bird in the hotel lobby .<ssssss>i think the room be a great size for a family of four , and with kid , the fridge and microwave come in handy .<ssssss>the beach be great as well and do not get too crowd while we be there .<ssssss>on the negative side , we find the service to be uniformly terrible .<ssssss>i do not think we have one friendly or helpful exchange with a single staff person , from the desk clerk who check we in -lrb- bored , surly and unhelpful -rrb- , to the restaurant where we eat lunch -lrb- we show up at 1:00 and stand wait for some time , with staff people avoid eye contact so they do not have to seat we - i finally have to call to a waiter across the room and tell he we be sit down ! -rrb-<ssssss>, to the maid who never say hello .<ssssss>the clientele be quite mixed , and there be not many family stay there , though it seem there be a lot of family pay from the outside and use the pool , which get quite crowd .<ssssss>there be no lifeguard or any kind of supervision at the pool area , which get really crowd on the shallow side .<ssssss>while we be there , a couple engage in some inappropriate behavior at poolside - particularly in front of a pool full of kid !<ssssss>
4 5 4 2 5 5 5 5		great hotel i stay here for a weekend break and i have no complaint .<ssssss>it be clean , well maintain and the staff be extremely friendly and helpful.the room facility be excellent even though it be a bit small for my liking .<ssssss>the room and bathroom be in a great condition and very clean.the breakfast buffet on the first floor really surpass my expectation , there be a excellent choice of food and there be no problem with go back up for more.there be really only one downside to this hotel and this be the reason i be only give it a 4 ; it be the location .<ssssss>the hotel be well away from the main centre of barcelona which be a annoying at night .<ssssss>it be ok during the day as there be a metro about 3/4 minute walk away and you can access the main tourist spot fairly quickly .<ssssss>the neighbourhood may look a bit dodgy but it be perfectly safe .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 4 4 -1		beyond small !<ssssss>my husband and i be particularly fond of funky/modern boutique hotel , however the size of we room leave we a bit disappointed .<ssssss>the room be clean and decorate cool , but there be very little space .<ssssss>we be not expect a 900 square foot suite , but it be so small we could hardly find carpet to walk on !<ssssss>the bathroom be hand down the smallest either of we have ever see in we life .<ssssss>although maybe there be advantage to be able to shower , sit on the toilet and wash you hand all at the same time .<ssssss>the sushi restaurant attach to the hotel be great , and the staff be all friendly enough .<ssssss>it be also a good location be close to shopping and pike place market .<ssssss>
2 2 5 2 5 2 2 -1		er ... what can i say ?<ssssss>i get to amsterdam a lot and this time , some friend and i decide to stay at the new movenpick .<ssssss>i feel compel to post a reivew this time.i will start with the positive point : the room and bathroom be lovely .<ssssss>we have a great view over the city and harbour .<ssssss>pillow etc be really comfy .<ssssss>interior be great and it be very clean.now the rest : most of the staff , with the exception of a few , that we encounter be rude , could not understand simple question or request and simply have no idea what be go on .<ssssss>both my friend and i agree that there be bit of a attitude problem go on .<ssssss>this be surprising to I because at any other hotel i have stay at in amsterdam over the last 9 year , from the 1 * to the 5 * i have never have those issue .<ssssss>for example .<ssssss>.<ssssss>we find that most -lrb- not all -rrb- the day time reception staff pleasant however the night time staff be a different story .<ssssss>they be unhelpful , not bother and rude .<ssssss>a example : simple question like ` do you have internet here ? '<ssssss>or ` do you know of / can find I a mechanic ? '<ssssss>prove too difficult or too much of a effort to understand and answer .<ssssss>one member of staff think we question be beyond the service the hotel provide .<ssssss>we have only ask he about where we could find a mechanic and not ask he to fix the car .<ssssss>when ask if they have internet , she reply ` no ' .<ssssss>i ask ` do you have a business centre ' ?<ssssss>she reply ` no ' .<ssssss>i say well do you know any internet cafe 's near by she say ` no ' .<ssssss>i assume the reason for she unhelpful abrupt answer because i may have interupt she have a happy chat with the colleague even though i have wait for she to finish.we have 3 people stay in we room .<ssssss>2 people for 2 night and 3 people for 3 night .<ssssss>on the last night with the 3rd person we be give 2 towel and no extra bed linen for the sofa bed .<ssssss>fair enough but then when we call reception to ask they on late saturday night to bring extra bed linen and a towel up - they do not !<ssssss>i order a taxi - the concierge tell I to come down as it be there .<ssssss>it be not there .<ssssss>i ask and be tell 5 min .<ssssss>i wait for 20 min , ask again but then no one know , until think it would be quicker to walk or take the tram rather than wait for the hotel to do anything for me.on check out i ask the receptionist to put a certain amount on my credit card and the difference on my friend 's card .<ssssss>i explain this to she three time .<ssssss>she then charge my card for the full amount .<ssssss>when i mention she mistake , she say , rather annoyed , that ' i have tell she to do that ' .<ssssss>i look at my friend rather puzzle as we have explain three time .<ssssss>she correct it.i think it would be a better hotel once fully do and certain staff member get lesson in communication and interpersonal skill .<ssssss>i would not stay here again .<ssssss>i prefer a hotel that more centrally located so i can walk to most place in 5 - 10 min as oppose to 20 - 35 min but on that note it be we fault for choose this hotel and interpret ` walk distance ' as mean 5 - 10 min .<ssssss>
2 3 2 1 2 3 4 -1		ok , some major problem get this room thru hotwire , so i guess i can not complain , but be give the smallest room know to mankind , like a 13x13 size , window look out into a crack between the building altho i request a street view .<ssssss>room clean , bathroom ok .<ssssss>ac break after first day , miserable condition , come back to room at 430pm , to find nothing have be down , towel on floor , bed not make , etc.complained at desk and they switch my room to a suite , with a window view .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>bed be comfortable .<ssssss>so for the price i pay , it be decent .<ssssss>food in restaurant awful , have the breakfast buffet for $ 21.99 and it be awful.it 's located 2 block off canal st , not bad , unless you can not walk anywhere , 2 block from the st. charle streetcar .<ssssss>
4 4 4 5 4 3 4 2		for nature lover ok with the rough edge ok , here be the deal.i stay at the waka shorea for 5 night in august 2006 .<ssssss>i be pretty curious about the waka shorea since i have a hard time find any review of the place!the waka shorea be for nature lover unafraid of a few rough edge .<ssssss>the location of the waka shorea be in a very remote part of the national park .<ssssss>there be long hair deer -lrb- more like moose -rrb- and grey monkey roam the grounds .<ssssss>wake up at the waka shorea be kind of like be in a safari .<ssssss>the ocean be the clearest and bluest water i have experience surround balus .<ssssss>snorkeling be truly amazing just off they peer .<ssssss>-lrb- i have snorkele in the maldive , tahitus , and hawaii -rrb- they have sport center that give mountain bike and hiking tour through the park .<ssssss>there be snorkele trip everyday to the famous deer island .<ssssss>i be travel solo so i do not want to snorkel by myself so the waka shorea assisgn one of they diver to snorkel with I which be alot of fun .<ssssss>go to station number 2 on the island .<ssssss>it be one of the best place i have ever snorkeled.back to the hotel .<ssssss>if you be look for a luxury hotel , the waka shorea be not you choice .<ssssss>yet , be in such a amazing natural santuary make I forget about all the rough edge .<ssssss>they really need to have a reception area at the waka shorea .<ssssss>it be hard get a manager to speak with but when i do finally speak to one my request be always fulfilled.i wish they would have a bar where guest could relax and hang out.the food be ok .<ssssss>fresh fish mix in with some balinese dish at reasonable price .<ssssss>they also have italian and inter continental food to please all taste .<ssssss>they do make they own bread .<ssssss>the breakfast be perfect with egg , fruit , and fresh bread .<ssssss>there be no bar but you order a drink at the pool they will make one up for you .<ssssss>i see several family with small child who seem to be enjoy themselves , all the cabin be make with natural material so it be very zen .<ssssss>they have 2 massage therapist work on the premise .<ssssss>i would not recommend the waka for elderly people who have a problem with stair since there be a few .<ssssss>they beach be not that friendly since the low tide make it impossible to enter the water without cut yourself on the coral.all in all , it be the location of the waka shorea that be really special.if you be willing to give up some of that western luxury to experience a truly unique location , then the waka shorea may be for you !<ssssss>
4 4 4 3 5 5 5 3		good choice , a bit off the beaten path , and a bit of charm i spend 2 night at the atla .<ssssss>it be a very solid 3 star hotel .<ssssss>the atlas be not pretentious .<ssssss>it be quiet and personal .<ssssss>what the atlas especially have go for it be the place itself and the location .<ssssss>it be a lovely converted mansion , i think , and it be literally a few meter walk from vondelpark .<ssssss>kind of a wow location in a very upscale residential neighborhood with charming early 20th century home and apartment building around it .<ssssss>my room be top floor , in the front , so under a gabled roof , probably the former attic , so i have a bit of a view of the street .<ssssss>there be room down to the basement .<ssssss>my room be small , but that be amsterdam for you .<ssssss>i have be to that city several time and smaller room be usually the case .<ssssss>it have a tight but complete bathroom with lot of hot water .<ssssss>the color in the room tend to orange , but that be not a big deal .<ssssss>the room feel homey and it have a flat screen tv .<ssssss>the bed be supremely comfortable .<ssssss>i do not try the breakfast , because there be a nice cafe-bar a minute away.i find the staff very helpful when i ask for transportation information .<ssssss>the girl on the desk pull out map , find schedule on the internet , and so forth .<ssssss>quite a nice surprise.you think the atlas be out of the way , but it be 50 meter from the # 2 tram stop which take you right into the center of amsterdam in under 10 minute , and it be no more than a 10 minute walk to the van gogh museum -lrb- and another few to the rijksmuseum .<ssssss>the only drawback in location be that tram stop around midnight so you need a taxi to get back late in the night .<ssssss>and the night rate start at a ridiculously high 7.50 euro .<ssssss>
2 1 2 -1 1 -1 5 -1		location good , hotel not 4-star pro : convenient location opposite central station , within walk distance of everything , staff extremely helpful friendlycon : very basic , look date , in need of refurbishment .<ssssss>breakfast expensive @ â ?<ssssss>0 per person for a buffet -lrb- food not hot -rrb- .<ssssss>hotel charge extra for use of gym , sauna steam room , even use of towel !!<ssssss>this be not acceptable in a 4-star hotel - we complain and get a gym session free.would not recommend this hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 2 4 3 3		okay hotel , do not live up to expectation ... we stay at this hotel columbus day weekend with we two child and basically it be not worth the money we spend .<ssssss>the location : excellent , walkable to the aquarium , right near quincy market and coffee/bagel shop .<ssssss>the lobby : nice lobby , friendly check - in staff and it be a very quick check-in .<ssssss>the room : when i call i have request a room as high up as possible , we end up on the 6th floor .<ssssss>not a big deal , but dissapointing just the same .<ssssss>when we first walk in , we be happy about the size of the living room area , there be a table with four chair , a little kitchen area with a sink and lot of cabinet , dish , coffee pot , and microwave and refridgerator .<ssssss>the bedroom be tiny , barely enough room to get around the bed which we think be hard and not very comfortable .<ssssss>the pull out couch be awful , we two kid sleep on it , but the mattress be bent and dip down in the center .<ssssss>the bathroom be okay , nice size , but could use some update , the whole room need to be repaint as the paint be just chip off in a lot of area throughout , the worst part of the room be the filthy carpet , they either need to be steam clean or totally replace .<ssssss>after walk around in we room in clean white sock -lrb- one person have grey sock on -rrb- we notice that the bottom of we sock be black .<ssssss>it be pretty disgusting .<ssssss>for $ 385 a night and $ 365 -lrb- aaa discount -rrb- a night , we would expect a cleaner room and a better maintained room .<ssssss>we would not stay there again .<ssssss>

2 2 4 -1 4 -1 2 -1		not at this price just get back from the westin rio mar on saturday april 15th , we be there a week .<ssssss>the hotel property itself be very nice and well keep .<ssssss>the staff that be there be very helpful -lrb- more on that in a minute -rrb- .<ssssss>we have a mountain view room and it be fine .<ssssss>we be there with we two child 4 9 and the room be fine for all of we .<ssssss>now the downside all of the on-site restaurant be price out of site for dinner and none better then outback .<ssssss>we go to all of they palio , the grille room , aqua luna .<ssssss>we average dinner bill with one bottle of wine be over $ 250.00 every night .<ssssss>please keep in mind the kid be eat a hot dog or macaroni and cheese .<ssssss>i read some of the review before i start to write this and some of the reviewer state that the hotel be only 45 minute from the airport or old san juan .<ssssss>well , to I that be a pretty long drive .<ssssss>since the hotel be in the middle of nowhere you pretty much feel like a prisoner of the resort .<ssssss>if it rain while you be down there or if you need a break from the pool , boy be you in trouble .<ssssss>to break up we trip we decide to take a cab ride to old san juan .<ssssss>.<ssssss>$ 180.00 round trip .<ssssss>would have rent a car for the day but the avi on site have no car available .<ssssss>all in all there be plenty of place you can spend $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 for a week vacation and it be my opinion this be not the place .<ssssss>oh get back to my above mention staffing issue .<ssssss>you could never find a waiter around the pool area and on top of that each restaurant be close at least 2 night while we be down there because they do not have the proper staffing level .<ssssss>i know i may sound a little tough on this place but do not only take my opinion we end up meeting about 7 couple while we be down there and they all have the same opinion except for the family that golf .<ssssss>this be what i would call a one and do ... but if you can get it for real cheap go for three or four day only .<ssssss>hope this help ...<ssssss>
3 1 1 3 5 1 3 5		wish i could have love it more the property be very beautiful and have fabulous common area and yes , breakfast be fantastic - esp outside in the courtyard .<ssssss>the people who serve breakfast be really nice - great service.the location really be not that great compare to other paris 6/7 property .<ssssss>it be on a non-descript side street that lead into another non-descript side street that be then off a busy avenue or two - it be near st. sulpice but there be hotel that be closer to the seine , the heart of st. germain and the luxembourg gardens.it be very expensive for what you get - we book a suite and what qualify as a suite be pretty funny even for paris standard - it be basically a large room but with enough space for two chair and a desk .<ssssss>we frequently stay at another nearby hotel that really provide a suite for a similar price to what we paid.service -lrb- breakfast -rrb- be great but i agree with comment about reception .<ssssss>in particular there be a gentleman with no hair and glass -lrb- the only one -rrb- who be downright rude to we .<ssssss>they will not win any service award .<ssssss>

1 1 5 4 5 1 4 3		really unenjoyable pr vacation - rio mar just return from a week 's vacation at the rio mar in pr with 2 of we child and 4 granchildren and 2 inlaw with 2 other child -lrb- 8 adult and 6 child in total -rrb- .<ssssss>we be part of a modest size group .<ssssss>on a scale of 1 to 10 , we opinion , two .<ssssss>first , we be to have receive a lower group rate of $ 369 a night , however , what no one tell we be that the hotel add on a resort service fee 8 % , so the room be about $ 30 more per night .<ssssss>this hidden charge be , in we opinion calculate to fool the traveller and we believe be unethical and dishonest , since the room charge be not $ 369 but $ 369 plus $ 29.52 per night .<ssssss>the hotel also add a bellman charge , but do not advise we when we check in so we unnecessarily also tip the bellman .<ssssss>also add in be a room housekeeping gratuity charge , which we be also not advise of but discover when we ask for the bill the night before check out .<ssssss>we also discover one of we room -lrb- we have 4 -rrb- be overcharge because of a mistake , but the night manager would not attend to it at the time and since we be leave at 5 be the next day there be nothing that we could do .<ssssss>the night manager be less than helpful and we do not expect much more from the hotel manager , mark stevenson , whom we will send the information contain herein .<ssssss>the hotel staff appear to be more concerned with attend to a convention group of 600 there at the same time than we modest size group as well as small group or individual .<ssssss>worst yet be the meal service : lunch at the hotel .<ssssss>a patio restaurant .<ssssss>if you be serve in less than a hour after you give you order -lrb- and you have to sit at a table to give a order since they would not take the order in advance -rrb- you could consider yourself among the fortunate .<ssssss>staff alternate between unconcerned or could care less .<ssssss>a turkey burger sandwich with a piece of tomato that be inedible and not ripe .<ssssss>dinner - although the actual food in the restaurant be tasty , the kitchen be either understaff or incompetent .<ssssss>we make advance reservation at 3 restaurant for each night there and the earlest we be serve be in the japanese -lrb- a hour -rrb- .<ssssss>the other two -lrb- the italian and fish restaurant -rrb- average from a hour and a quarter to over a hour and a half after we give we order .<ssssss>by the time the food come the child be tired and cranky , the parent be also the same and the experience be more unpleasant each day .<ssssss>moreover , we make reservation at the early time of 6 p.m and be one of the first one in eacfh restaurant so we could get moderately quick service - if we have come later i think a sleep bag would have be necessary .<ssssss>room be clean and fine and housekeeping staff be excellent .<ssssss>golf course staff helpful .<ssssss>but these positive could not overcome all the negative .<ssssss>all in all , if i have a choice for a vacation resort in pr , it would not be the rio mar and i a inclined to think this be a wyndham problem also so we will make it we business to avoid the wyndham chain in the future .<ssssss>

2 3 2 4 5 2 2 3		the grand hyatt seattle corner suite be not so grand !<ssssss>we stay at the grand hyatt seattle for 3 day between christmas and new year .<ssssss>we choose this hotel base upon location for shopping and trip advisor review for a luxury weekend without the kid .<ssssss>last time to seattle , we stay at the waterfront marriott for 2 night before a alaskan cruise , and i must say we both like the marriott overall much better than the hyatt .<ssssss>we have a corner suite at the hyatt and the layout be really weird .<ssssss>there be a small entryway lead into the living room .<ssssss>the living room have the most uncomfortable sofa , a match chair , -lrb- both scratch and wear -rrb- mini bar and a desk and chair .<ssssss>one wall be floor to ceiling window and one small panel the size of a large mailbox at floor level be the only opening window in the whole suite !<ssssss>and this be a smoking suite !!!!<ssssss>there be a very narrow hallway with closet on the leave where the window would be and the bathroom off to the right .<ssssss>the problem with the closte be that if you have one of the closet door open , the other person in the room can not pass to go back and forth between the living room , bathroom or bedroom without close all the closet door .<ssssss>this be a very bad design flaw and we would never book a corner suite here for this reason again.the bathroom be large , clean and very nice .<ssssss>separate shower , tub and lot of marble .<ssssss>it be the only part of the suite which live up to the grand hyatt reputation .<ssssss>the bedroom be small -lrb- comfortable king bed , 2 nightstand , 1 chair and a dresser with a tv on top -rrb- and have 2 wall of floor to ceiling window .<ssssss>unfortunately you have to close the curtain completely if you want privacy as there be a new building go up across the street and the crew could and would look right in .<ssssss>on a postive note , the corner bedroom be incredibly quiet .<ssssss>ruth cris be they hotel restaurant and even though you can charge it to you room , you do not accrue gold passport point for dine there .<ssssss>unfortunately my husband and i lose each other in nordstrom and upon return to the hyatt , the front desk would not give I a key to we suite .<ssssss>apparently we reservation be under he name and even though it be for a party of 2 and i have my id and the credit card which be the same one that they have take a imprint of from I at check in , they still would not let I in until he arrive .<ssssss>i be a bit miff to say the least .<ssssss>if you stay here , make sure the front desk have each person name on the reservation in case you get lock out .<ssssss>register as mr and mr be not enough .<ssssss>
3 3 4 3 3 2 3 5		excellent with a couple of hiccough to be fair , this be a good hotel .<ssssss>we have a club level room and love have the apple computer and free internet access .<ssssss>it be extremely useful.we choose to stay here follow read a number of review on this web-site .<ssssss>the room be a good size and it be tastefully decorate .<ssssss>it be useful have breakfast in the club room especially with little one .<ssssss>the location be good too .<ssssss>i have no problem with the location .<ssssss>some people mention that time square would be a nightmare for drive because of the one way system .<ssssss>we have a navigation system in the rental car -lrb- a absolute must for go to nyc -rrb- and we do not get lose once .<ssssss>toy r we with its ferris wheel be very close and the kid enjoy the ride.on the negative side , we arrive at about 3.00 and the lobby be heave so it take we about 30 minute to check in .<ssssss>if you have a car park at the hotel , do remember to get the reception to stamp you ticket and also to hand over the porter/bell hop ticket so that you luggage be deliver to you room .<ssssss>i would have give this hotel a much higher rating if we do not have a problem with the room cleaning .<ssssss>have be out all day , we return to we room to find that it still be not make up .<ssssss>i have leave we dirty laundry in the appropriate bag on we door , as the laundry sheet advise that laundry to be do the follow day should be outside you hotel room by 9.00 in the morning .<ssssss>i dutifully do this , but do not call reception to ask someone to pick the laundry up .<ssssss>the maid therefore see the laundry on the door and decide not to clean the room .<ssssss>the maid give I real attitude when i ask she why she have not clean the room and if she could do it now .<ssssss>i be quite surprise by how rude she actually be !<ssssss>i report this to the concierge and to be fair the next day the cleaning be do quickly and efficiently .<ssssss>lesson learn : if you want tray pick up , laundry pick up or anything else do - simply call the express phone number on the phone and do not hang around wait for thing to happen because they will not !<ssssss>finally , we take advantage of the hotel doctor because my son have develop a ear infection and be in a good deal of pain .<ssssss>i should stress that there be not a hotel doctor , but a number the hotel give you for a on-call doctor who will come to you hotel room .<ssssss>the doctor call to understand the age of the patient and the problem before arrive laden with all the correct medication , antibiotic , drop , injection etc. it be a little ott but we be fly in 36 hour and i do not want to risk a problem .<ssssss>i be fairly impress by the doctor 's conscientiousness until i get the bill which be for $ 510 .<ssssss>i almost faint !<ssssss>worse , i have to pay the doctor in cash as she would not take any card .<ssssss>fortunately , there be a atm in the lobby , but i do feel a bit like a pimp pay she by the elevator .<ssssss>we insurance would not cover the bill when we get back home because the doctor be outside of we health care network .<ssssss>just beware of this in advance and check that you be cover should the need arise!another plus -lrb- i think -rrb- be the food .<ssssss>the room service menu be unusually good , varied and healthy !<ssssss>the child 's menu be also a refreshing change to the norm .<ssssss>i be impressed .<ssssss>
1 1 2 3 2 1 1 3		go somewhere else !<ssssss>i make my booking at this hotel directly from the hotel website .<ssssss>i have opt for a harbor view room but i be give a room that they refer to as hill face .<ssssss>i call up , visit the reservation desk regard this but to no avail .<ssssss>finally , they change my room some 10 hour after my arrival after i have express enough displeasure about all this .<ssssss>below be a few thing that i would like to share : * the room be tiny with barely any space to even walk .<ssssss>* the shower cabinet be so small that you would invariably bump yourself against the wall no matter how straight you stand while take a shower .<ssssss>* i have never experience so much noise inside a hotel room .<ssssss>even with the television on inside the room , the sound of people walk in the aisle could be hear loud enough inside the room .<ssssss>moreover , noise from adjacent floor be also fairly apparent .<ssssss>* even though the hotel be close to mtr quarry bay station , there no market nearby that you can walk up to .<ssssss>* request for wake up call be ignored.my suggestion would be to opt for some other hotel .<ssssss>this one be horribly expensive if you look at the pain point -lrb- even otherwise it be very expensive -rrb- .<ssssss>
2 2 4 2 4 1 -1 -1		terrible service this be my first trip to paris .<ssssss>we hotel be book via a travel agent .<ssssss>the hotel be clean and charming but the service be terrible .<ssssss>prob .<ssssss>the worst service i have ever experience .<ssssss>the front desk send we to a restaraunt that be literally shut down .<ssssss>look like it have be out of business for month .<ssssss>then , we go to the bar to relax b/f head out for the evening and there be no one working .<ssssss>we ask the front desk and they send someone over to take we order and make we drink .<ssssss>once the drink be make -lrb- one round -rrb- the woman wish we a good evening and go out with she friend -lrb- whom be wait for she while she serve we -rrb- .<ssssss>that be it .<ssssss>no more bar service .<ssssss>finally , we check out and go to the english countryside .<ssssss>when i arrive i realize that i leave the painting i have purchase in the room .<ssssss>i have a hotel rep. in england , who speak french , call the front desk .<ssssss>when she tell they i have leave the painting and could they ask housekeeping if it be find , the front desk clerk say sorry , no painting be find .<ssssss>he didnt even bother ask anyone , he just say sorry .<ssssss>i call again the next morning in hope of talk to someone more helpful and they do the same thing .<ssssss>so , make sure you dont leave anything behind .<ssssss>the last thing , the area the hotel be in lack restaraunt choice , esp in the evening .<ssssss>i would stay near the latin quarter and when we visit again , we will not be return here .<ssssss>
4 2 5 4 4 2 4 -1		some good , some bad , but definitely overprice .<ssssss>just come off a 6 day , 5 night stay at el san juan , travel with a bunch of friend in they mid-twenty .<ssssss>this be definitely a party hotel , and the lobby give that away right off the bat with a assortment of very impressive bar area and restaurant .<ssssss>the lobby be pretty calm during the day , but at night its very exciting if you want to party .<ssssss>the pool area be also very nice , with three different pool , swim-up bar , a few nice hot tub and alot of comfortable seat to lounge in .<ssssss>pool area be a big plus for me.now the bad stuff ... my room be keep very nice and clean , but we see a bunch of we friend ' room , and one room have a problem with ant in the bathroom , another room have really gross mold and mildew in the shower , and one of we friend in another floor have such noise problem that they could barely sleep any of the night .<ssssss>i personally do not have any of these problem , but we see three room that do , so i guess its a bit of the luck of the draw there.the hotel staff , especially at the front desk , be generally pretty rude and sometimes even outright mean .<ssssss>one concierge outright lie to we when we ask about the means of transportation to get to the el yunque rainforest , and another be extremely condescending when ask about restaurant that have vegetarian option -lrb- pr be not very big on that fyi -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a couple nice and patient front desk worker , but overall , the attitude be still poor .<ssssss>overall , my experience be positive , but you have to be willing to overpay for the value , and you may get a really loud floor or a poor room .<ssssss>it be a great place for 20-30 year old that want to party .<ssssss>

3 3 4 5 5 3 2 3		modern decor , irregular service as many other reviewer have note , the hotel be located very conveniently , a short walk up from where the much larger westin palace -lrb- can count on find taxi there , if not in front of the vincci 's often clogged , narrow one way c prado -rrb- and very close to the prado museum , two block from the always bustling plaza santa ana and a very manageable 15 minute walk to the main atocha train station .<ssssss>common facility be very attractive and clean , and all the room we see clean and modern , befitting a very new hotel -lrb- vintage 2006 ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>we be one of three couple stay at the hotel for several night in late sept through oct 2 : room face the main calle prado bit brighter but small and expose to road noise ; we have a back inner courtyrard -lrb- in fact , more like airshaft0 face room , a bit larger , and quiet but very dark -lrb- worsen by the very dark decor -rrb- .<ssssss>third room look out over the large inner patio/courtyard , with a small balcony and be by far the largest and brightest .<ssssss>we find voices/noises from other room amplify by the inner airshaft .<ssssss>we biggest complaint : two different morning request for wake up call be entirely miss and a promise to respond to request re travel information ultimately never elicit a response .<ssssss>bathroom be spacious and windowed .<ssssss>there be no clock in the room , and note by other , just one pillow per person .<ssssss>the wireless connection be expensive -lrb- at 16 euro .<ssssss>which i pay first night -rrb- but in fact turn out to be notnecessary since there be a broadband cable plug in wall -lrb- unadvertised -rrb- that deliver free high speed internet if you bring cable .<ssssss>while the facility be modern and stylish , do not find it particularly enjoyable to actually stay in the room -lrb- as oppose to say , the alfonso in seville , where we spend 3 night follow week ... -rrb- .<ssssss>incidentally , we rate , exclude breakfast for vincci be just 25 % below alfonso .<ssssss>we do not have breakfast in we rate package -lrb- we friend do -rrb- and staff be very inflexible regard minor adjustment .<ssssss>
5 4 5 5 5 5 5 1		superb , but ... stay at this great hotel for the third time this year .<ssssss>as i have diamond status i be immediately put on the 59th floor and as usual service , room etc. be great.the only thing i continue to critisize be the extra money such a hotel want from you for the use of in-room internet access .<ssssss>the smallest hampton inn , also part of the hilton chain , less posh and a lot cheaper offer this service for free .<ssssss>a logic i fail to understand .<ssssss>
1 1 2 4 1 2 1 4		no mango shake , no stay .<ssssss>hilton hotel be never impeccable but always decent .<ssssss>but , this one be a disaster , in my experience.the exterior be under construction , so arrive on a rain day be a yuck first impression .<ssssss>then the front desk woman have a attitude .<ssssss>the room and bathroom be small .<ssssss>the luggage bench have a visible layer of white dust which be unacceptable .<ssssss>finally when i go to one of the hotel restaurant , the staff could not accommodate my simple request .<ssssss>i ask they to not use the ginger in the mango shake with honey and ginger .<ssssss>the waitress say she have to check with the chef , and then tell I the chef say we can not do it b/c it will not be the same drink any more .<ssssss>i tell she i would take full responsibility for the drink be unoriginal or whatever it would turn out to be , because that be what i want .<ssssss>she then have to check with the manager , and return to tell I we manager say you should maybe order the orange juice instead .<ssssss>i be stunned but be really in the mood for a mango shake .<ssssss>so i order the mango shake with the ginger .<ssssss>i then pack my stuff and leave in a hurry .<ssssss>you might think it be funny that i leave a hotel for a mango drink .<ssssss>but it be the principle of it that i can not tolerate .<ssssss>in the capital city of china where thousand of new and exist hotel be compete for the summer olympic customer and beyond , there be no need to put up with anything that be below satisfactory.btw , the marriott west hotel in beij that i move to be a hidden gem .<ssssss>beautiful french decor .<ssssss>amazing city view if you get a nice room .<ssssss>and , great service !<ssssss>

1 1 3 1 3 3 3 1		cancel after one night when we get to the hotel , we have a 0.5 mile trek from the parking lot to we villa .<ssssss>the security guard post at the entrance ignore we -lrb- would have be nice to know that a shuttle service run ! -rrb-<ssssss>while the property be rather nice and the room be nice , it be so spread out that you have to take a shuttle to the pool , which just be not very helpful if you need to go back to you room.the hotel do a good job at extra cost - 6 phone call to san juan -lrb- short call to book another hotel -rrb- = $ 34.00 ; parking -lrb- nightly , in the middle of nowhere puerto rico -rrb- = 10.00 .<ssssss>this place be not a vacation destination - it be good for convention and that be about it .<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 3 4 3 -1		basic but good value i stay in this hotel during the world cup of 2006 .<ssssss>it be in a very good location , close to the trainstation and a short walk to the river which be one of the best feature of the city .<ssssss>the room be small but we didnt spend much time in they there be air conditioning and a small fridge which help as there be a bit of a heatwave on .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and hotel clean frankfurt be a beautiful city and i would go back , i would also go back to europa .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 4 5 5		huge telephone bill we stay 5 day at the casa camper .<ssssss>the service be nice and very helpful .<ssssss>however there be two flaw .<ssssss>one of they be that at the day we check in at the hotel , we ask how much it will cost to make international call .<ssssss>the girl at the entrance tell we about $ 1 for every 5 minute which sound very reasonable , and not a rip - off price as many hotel be take .<ssssss>however when we receive the bill at the end of we stay , we have to pay $ 23 for 13 minute of call time .<ssssss>there be a few call that no one even answer -lrb- e.g. a 3 second call for $ 0.40 and no answering machine answer -rrb- .<ssssss>the other issue be that we friend stay in barcelona and they come to visit we , and the hotel personnel let they in , while at the end the bill show $ 14.10 for this visit .<ssssss>nobody tell we that there be a fee involve for let we friend in .<ssssss>we should have know this fact before let people in.besides these flaw the stay be ok , but the hotel be very simple and the price -lrb- 235 euro -rrb- be definitely not worth the stay .<ssssss>we stay one night at the marina hotel which cost a little more -lrb- 280 euro -rrb- but be definitely a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>if the free food be important for you , think about all the delicious food that you can taste at the street of barcelona .<ssssss>this hotel be nice , but the price be too high for what you get , and for I it be very important to get the real fact before you pay -lrb- telephone and friend visit -rrb- .<ssssss>
3 4 3 4 5 2 4 3		good quick getaway my husband and i stay in early november for a four day anniversary trip .<ssssss>hereâs a overview of we experience : roomwe stay in a royal service deluxe junior suite .<ssssss>the floor and the bathroom be marble -lrb- except for the tub -rrb- .<ssssss>the mattress be hard , but we sleep fine .<ssssss>the linen be okay , but there be some hole in the pillow and sheet that we notice on we last night .<ssssss>each morning , the room be make up , but the night turndown service be inconsistent .<ssssss>one night we come home to a bottle of rum , candle and flower on the bed and in the bathroom .<ssssss>the other night , nothing .<ssssss>the room be clean , and housekeeping keep the bathroom stock -lrb- but take away all of the conditioner and put extra lotion in itâs place -rrb- .<ssssss>we refrigerator have complimentary beer , soda and water that be inconsistently refill .<ssssss>one issue with the room be that we travel agent have request a king bed â?she have write âcelebrating anniversaryâ?and king bed , pleaseâ?in all cap on we paperwork .<ssssss>we be show to we room , and find two double bed .<ssssss>we ask to be move , be tell it would take a hour , and it actually take three .<ssssss>we have leave we luggage in the first room , so we couldnât change out of we travel clothes .<ssssss>we give ourselves a tour of the resort in the meantime.foodthere be a number of restaurant in the hotel , and with only three night , we obviously didnât get to all of they .<ssssss>we try to get some of the staff to tell we which to try , but they give we a non-committal âtheyâre all goodâ?answer .<ssssss>we eat at the gabus restaurant , exclusively for royal service guest , each day for breakfast and lunch and the first night for dinnerbecause we couldnât get a reservation due to we late arrival .<ssssss>the food at dinner be ala carte and buffet , and my husband be happy to eat two appetizer and a dinner .<ssssss>the food be decent â?not great , but not terrible .<ssssss>the buffet breakfast and lunch be good .<ssssss>we really enjoy the dominican offering â?the rice and bean be a different style each day , and the plantain dish be tasty .<ssssss>reservation could only be make a day in advance .<ssssss>because we enjoy the dominican food , we book reservation at el guarapo .<ssssss>the food be âupscaleâ?dominican , and it be not that impressive .<ssssss>we be in and out of the restaurant in about 45 minute , include appetizer , main course and dessert .<ssssss>the food seem pre-cooked , and come out very quickly .<ssssss>there be a wedding in another part of the restaurant , so i donât know if that contribute to the pace of the meal .<ssssss>we werenât do we first course before the next one come out .<ssssss>we final night , we eat at capri , the seafood restaurant .<ssssss>the food be better here , the kitchen be open , and they definitely prepare the food to order .<ssssss>at the beach bar and pool bar in the royal service section , there be snack offer throughout the day .<ssssss>service/staffthe staff , for the most part , be accommodate and willing to help .<ssssss>we have issue with we second room â?no robe , the tv remote didnât work , we toilet run â?that take over a day for they to attend to .<ssssss>however , they be minor issue that be fix .<ssssss>the golf cart driver always stop to see if we want a ride â?we be located near the royal service lobby , and the walk to the beach be about 7 minute , so we usually decline .<ssssss>royal serviceit be a nice upgrade , as the beach and pool be never too crowd .<ssssss>however , while not crowd with people , there be a lot of beach chair cram into the royal service beach area .<ssssss>weâre early riser , and be at the beach before 9 , so we never have a problem sit where we want .<ssssss>part of the royal service be suppose to include butler service -lrb- we never see a butler -rrb- and a pillow menu -lrb- didnât see that , either -rrb- .<ssssss>the r lobby do have a nice selection of alcohol after dinner where you could make you own drink , as well as a espresso machine that be available all day.overallthis vacation serve itâs purpose â?it be inexpensive , all-inclusive and get we a few day of sun .<ssssss>iâm use to smaller resort , so one with over 1000 room overwhelm I a bit .<ssssss>the grounds be well keep and there be turtle , heron -lrb- or egret -rrb- and lot of anole .<ssssss>we have tiny little bug in we bathroom , but nothing more scary than that.i speak basic spanish -lrb- two year in high school a decade ago -rrb- , and be fine with communicate .<ssssss>most of the staff speak english well , and there be other staff member who be communicate with the french and german speaking guest .<ssssss>there be a large non-american guest population and a lot of topless sunbathing .<ssssss>there be some seaweed in the water â?i donât know if it be due to the tropical depression that go through the week prior or if itâs normally like that .<ssssss>i wasnât wow by the resort , and do not know if i would go back , but it be a good quick getaway .<ssssss>

2 2 3 3 4 3 4 1		stay somewhere else next time my husband and i go to the ritz for a wedding .<ssssss>we be really look forward to stay at the ritz again , because we get marry at the ritz in laguna beach/dana point in california .<ssssss>we arrive at the ritz 8 day into we trip to bali , after stay at the nusa dua hotel and spa and a beautiful local hotel in ubud .<ssssss>in both place we be upgrade to suite and or villa , full of balinese culture , charm and elegance and lot of amenity .<ssssss>upon arrive at the ritz we be very disappointed with we ocean view room , that look like any other room in any other ritz hotel around the world .<ssssss>in other word it lack much balinese culture and style .<ssssss>the amenity that be include with we other hotel that we stay at before the ritz , far outweigh what be include at the ritz and at a more affordable price .<ssssss>pay $ 10 a hour for internet service be ridiculous , when we get it for free at all other hotel , drink super expensive with little alcohol , food ok , and the grounds lack the true balinese culture and feel .<ssssss>additionally the room do not have any drawer space which i thought be odd at a 5 star hotel .<ssssss>the ocean front infinity pool be the highlight of the trip along with a great spa treatment .<ssssss>but overall i think the value be not there for the money .<ssssss>when we return to bali we will not be go to the ritz .<ssssss>the competition be too good with other hotel that offer more value for you money .<ssssss>
1 3 -1 -1 -1 1 1 -1		reservation refund problem i be a very frequent traveler and have never have to work so hard to get a deposit return .<ssssss>after book a stay at this property i be charge a one night deposit -lrb- typical for a new year stay in nola -rrb- but ultimately i have to cancel my reservation -lrb- and this be do several week before the deposit forfeit deadline -rrb- .<ssssss>the deposit be key in manually -lrb- not through a automated process -rrb- within 48 hour of make the reservation .<ssssss>the problem arise when i try to get the hotel to refund my deposit .<ssssss>it take almost six week and four phone call -lrb- the fourth call be to my credit card company -rrb- to get the deposit return to my credit card , which be totally unprofessional and unacceptable .<ssssss>and who can say whether i would have ever get the refund if i have not call .<ssssss>the staff member i speak with each time be pleasant about the situation -- no complaint there -- but they be completely ineffectual .<ssssss>ultimately after be tell three different time that it would be take care of -lrb- ... we will take care of that immediately sir ... i be send this to account again sir ... i will bring this matter to the gm 's attention myself sir -rrb- i finally file a dispute with my credit card company to force they to return my money ... which seem to have do the trick .<ssssss>this clearly show how interested they be in customer service and it be a shame because i visit nola often and would have consider stay there in the future , but i would never stay there now , not at any price .<ssssss>
4 1 1 2 2 2 4 2		a cool place to recover from jetlag the good : this property be architecturally gorgeous and well-designed , with a fabolous pool surround by day-bed and perfectly place for a sneek view of the ocean that be some distance away .<ssssss>the room be equally-well design and comfortable , with a adequate seating area and beautiful bathroom .<ssssss>the staff be quite friendly , and do go out of they way to assist you .<ssssss>the bad : that say , we experience at the bale fall short of what one would expect of a property with a high-price tag .<ssssss>although service be generally excellent , there be some shortcoming in this area .<ssssss>check-in be adequate , but ithe hotel fail to adequately explain the complex control in the room to we .<ssssss>check-out be especially challenging and unpleasant .<ssssss>although a car be wait to transport we , we luggage be in fact hold hostage in the room until the hotel be certain that we bill have be pay .<ssssss>this simply delay we preparartion for depart .<ssssss>breakfast be excellent ; dinner above-average , but lunch merely marginal at best.one would expect that the hotel would -lrb- as other hotel of this caliber in balus do so -rrb- provide bottled water for free whether in the room or dine with the hotel , as most hotel do not have potable water .<ssssss>be charge $ 5.00 we for a bottle of aqua simply becuase you request it with lunch be ridiculous .<ssssss>that be gouge the guest for a little extra money.the ugly : there be problem with the airconditioning and ceiling fan .<ssssss>when we move into a new room we second night , which have already be reserve in a different , lower price category , the new room have multiple problem , from a sink that obviously leak -lrb- with a towel place under the sink to catch the drip water !! -rrb-<ssssss>, a toilet that run all night , and a resident frog in we room , which defy we attempt to move it outside we quarter while we try to sleep . -rrb-<ssssss>although the hotel clearly know about some of the problem with the new room before it move we into it , instead of inform we of they , it try to upsell we into another room at a higher price !!<ssssss>indeed , when bring these problem o the attention of the room manager at the time of check-out , we be inform that the hotel have plan to take this room out of service because of the problem with it .<ssssss>this do not sit with we well .<ssssss>the hotel do not offer anything to address these issue other than a smile .<ssssss>we be not smile when we leave .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
1 1 1 -1 3 -1 2 -1		very different experience than other i make my reservation base on the comment here and perhaps because i be a single woman travel alone and the other be couple , i may have get the short end of the stick at this hotel .<ssssss>my room be literally not large enough for I to open the desk drawer and walk around ... i have to crawl on the bed to get around the desk .<ssssss>my room be on the ground floor and so noisy ... i do not understand the comment about this be a quiet location because i hear every conversation from the street .<ssssss>and , the air conditioning do not work in my room and i could not open the window because of the noise .<ssssss>i have travel a lot in europe and this be one of the worse hotel experience i have have .<ssssss>i have stay earlier in the week with my co-worker at the monna lisa which i have recommend base on review here and that one exceed my expectation , so perhaps my experience here be just a anomaly .<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 4 1 2 4		too bad service be so bad i like stay at the gallery hotel because it be located in a nice area of singapore -lrb- within walk distance to one of my company 's partner 's office -rrb- and the internet be free .<ssssss>the room be almost kind of modern , or at least they probably be when they first open .<ssssss>but this last stay at the gallery hotel really sour my experience and i do not think i will ever stay there again.when i check in i do not get the room type i want .<ssssss>i request a non-smoking queen/king bed through agoda and they be out of they when i check in .<ssssss>i ask they if they could upgrade I to the next size room with one bed , and they say they would check .<ssssss>but when they find out that i have book my room through a online service they say sorry , no .<ssssss>they do offer to upgrade I with $ 60 + + sgd more per night which i decline .<ssssss>i really do not know that book through a online service would mean that would be less motivate to keep a loyal customer happy.anyway , the stay be fairly uneventful until i get stick in one of the elevator .<ssssss>the elevator have not work for over a hour -lrb- it would not open on the 5th floor -rrb- but there be no sign for it warn guest .<ssssss>when i take the elevator up it get stick and i have to call for help .<ssssss>they admit that it be not work but only for the 5th floor .<ssssss>so they ask I to go up to the 6th floor and then walk down the stair .<ssssss>i be really shock that they would keep a elevator operating know that it be not work and with no warning to guest .<ssssss>in fact , the engineer do not even tell the manager -lrb- he do not know -rrb- until i make a fuss.i think sometimes you get a sign to not stay somewhere anymore , and the elevator incident be my sign .<ssssss>i hope that the management at the gallery change because it be too good of a hotel to be perform so poorly .<ssssss>it be really too bad because the housekeeping staff be excellent and very helpful , but they have these kink that show inflexibility and lack of concern for guest welfare , which so damage the hotel .<ssssss>

2 2 1 3 1 1 -1 3		not my best experience with marriott let I start of by say i be a big fan of marriott hotel but i think if the member of the board of marriott stay at this hotel they would not let they call it marriott .<ssssss>the front desk staff hardly respond when we check in .<ssssss>hand my room card and point towards the elevator do not smile or extend any welcome .<ssssss>the evening concerge act like i be disturbing he when i ask for info about place to see in napa.on the second night my daughter leave a tiffany neckace in bathroom on return she find it miss when we call the front desk they abruptly transfer I to housekeeping who reply they know nothing about it .<ssssss>what a suprise !<ssssss>no one ever call to address this theft .<ssssss>which bring I to the issue as to why there be not a safe avail in the room ?<ssssss>and lastly the bed where old and very uncomfortable , so if you stay here expect atleast the well know comfort of marriott bed you out of luck .<ssssss>
4 4 3 3 3 4 5 2		i be satisfied i stay on the hyatt for about a week do business in miami .<ssssss>i have a nice stay , and the staff be really friendly .<ssssss>very nice breakfast and a wellequiped and clean gym.room be spacious and clean.only bad thing to add be the fact that wireless internet access cost and parking be a bit expensive .<ssssss>
3 4 4 -1 2 -1 3 -1		nice hotel , but in the red light district we stay at hotel luxer for 3 night in february .<ssssss>we pay 70 euro/night and for that price , the hotel be very good .<ssssss>we choose it because it would allow we to walk to all the place we want to see , but it end up be right in the middle of the red light district , so we be constantly surround by post-teen tourist crowd the coffeeshop , and drug pushers.not so good aspect : * it would be really great if i could walk down the street to the hotel at the end of the day without be offer heroin or cocaine multiple time .<ssssss>it really get annoying and kind of ruin the great atmosphere that exist everywhere else in the city .<ssssss>* the reception at the hotel be also the bar , so it be always really smoky * we room stank of smoke when we first get there despite book a non-smoking room .<ssssss>it take a couple of day of open window to get rid of the smell .<ssssss>* there be a lack of decent food nearby , most of it be level at people come out of coffeeshop , we have to go pretty far to find a fresh meal.positives : * i actually find the staff to be really helpful , they be fairly pleasant .<ssssss>* room be a good size - lot of floorspace for luggage , table and chair , comfy bed .<ssssss>the bathroom be not big , but be very good and the shower be very good .<ssssss>tv have a good range of channel .<ssssss>* great breakfast - bread , cereal , juice , coffee machine , cake , pastry , fruit , cold meat .<ssssss>good variety and a good start to the day .<ssssss>* we be able to walk everywhere from there - anne frank house , museum , canal tour , heineken experience , and the train station be about a two minute walk away .<ssssss>* internet and a laundromat be both on the same street , a couple of door down and across the street.so overall , it be not so much the hotel that be a problem , just the area it be in .<ssssss>if you be plan to visit coffeeshop the whole time it would be perfect , if you want to see some sight you can walk everywhere from here , but be aware you will be in a dodgy area .<ssssss>not so much unsafe , just dodgy .<ssssss>as for the hotel itself , it be excellent value if you pay a lower rate as we do - if it be in a different area , i would definitely consider stay there again .<ssssss>i would still recommend this hotel , mainly to student and/or budget traveller .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 4 4 3 3		ok let 's get the good stuff out there : location : superbcommunal area : these make the hotel , they be old-fashioned but very cosy and you will happily sit in the library read the papers if you so desire.service : helpful and friendlyhowever , i always look forward to two thing when i go to a hotel , and they be a great room and a delicious breakfast .<ssssss>breakfast be distinctly average , not a very wide choice .<ssssss>and the standard room be tiny .<ssssss>i know this be standard for city-centre hotel , especially in a canal-house , but there be no floorspace even for we bag !<ssssss>we have to move chair to get the wardrobe open , there be nothing in the mini-bar , the bed mattress be awful and shower room be a different climate to the rest of the room , seemingly be located somewhere near the north pole.whilst i would not put anyone off stay here as the price be reasonable , it be not somewhere i would return simply because get a good night 's sleep be so hard .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 5 3 5 3		great location for air traveler plan and reserve 8 night , stay 1 .<ssssss>parking space be too close and barely allow enough room for a mid-size suv to pull in , nonetheless have enough room to open you door far enough to be able to get out without hit the vehicle next to you .<ssssss>the room we stay in be on the first floor but not really .<ssssss>you have to step up from the lobby to get to the same level and you have to step up from the parking lot as well .<ssssss>this mean you canât use a luggage cart to wheel you many piece into you room , you have to do it manually .<ssssss>the outside exit door relock when you leave so you canât reenter through it so you have to walk back to the side entrance to get in , and it wasnât even lock even though thereâs a card reader to stop unwanted traffic .<ssssss>the bathroom have just a shower , no tub .<ssssss>the refrigerator wasnât even on a shelf or a table , it be on the floor .<ssssss>iâm not talk about one of those large refrigerator either ; this be a small , rv-sized one .<ssssss>the closet be tiny and for a room with two full bed thereâs barely enough room for one person to hang they clothes and a jacket let alone a second person in the room .<ssssss>the dresser have only 4 drawer , one of which have 4 phone book in it .<ssssss>the light by the âdeskâ?can only be turn on if the switch on the wall by the main door to the room be on .<ssssss>this also turn on the light next to the television .<ssssss>luckily it have its own separate switch so you can turn it off if you donât need it while you work at the âdeskâ ?<ssssss>i say it that way because the âdeskâ?is about 4â ?<ssssss>x 2-1/2 â?and be merely a table .<ssssss>itâs hardly large enough for my notebook computer and mouse then they stick the internet connection device and a large plastic pamphlet holder on it too .<ssssss>there be no surge protector for the ac plug where one would normally insert a laptop/notebook plug and the cat5e cable that be for the internet isnât connect to one either , itâs just there lay on the floor hope youâll find it instead of think the internet in this hotel be wireless â?like the rest of the country be .<ssssss>i mean really , itâs seattle for peteâs sake .<ssssss>i would think that theyâd have wireless in the room , heck i see a bus drive by that say âWi-fi hotspotâ?so if a move bus can do it , why canât they.the shower be not small , at least compare to the one i have to deal with at home .<ssssss>the water valve assembly isnât firmly attach to the wall stud so it move around .<ssssss>the trim ring around the shower head pipe doesnât stay against the wall , even though it look like someone caulk it in a attempt to get it to stay.for a dog-friendly hotel they truly suck .<ssssss>thereâs virtually no grassy area and for the spot there be , be just mud .<ssssss>the hotelâs location isnât that great for walk you dog either .<ssssss>there be busy street all around and no walk path .<ssssss>the only option be to walk you dog around the build a few time and maybe on one pass youâll find the tiny spot of grass for they to use but since itâs the only one , donât expect it to be as clean as the toilet in you room.if you smoke donât plan on find a place to smoke outside .<ssssss>apparently thereâs a law about smoking within 25 foot of any entrance which may explain why thereâs no ashtray near the door .<ssssss>there be instead a nice few -lrb- thousand -rrb- pile of cigarette butt on the ground surround the hotel on the parking lot and in the rock garden and in the bushes.the hotel back onto the airport so itâs a bit noisy at time .<ssssss>luckily the runway be over a hill and pass a few building so when the large plane take off , the noise be somewhat muffle .<ssssss>if you like the noise , open the window and turn off you in-room air conditioner or heater , depend on the time of year .<ssssss>
1 1 4 -1 3 -1 1 -1		dont waste you time do yourself a favor and dont book a trip here !!<ssssss>the service be flat out horrible this apply to about 85 % of the staff -lrb- there be a few good people work there -rrb- .<ssssss>example be too many too list , but i can say make dinner reservation and tee time be a hassle .<ssssss>the employee either dont understand english , or pretend not too either way they be very unhelpfull and quick to have a attitiude , they basically dont care .<ssssss>the room be nice and the grounds and beach be beautifull , but that about it for this place .<ssssss>i have be too many other great place , this certainly be not one of they .<ssssss>dont make the same mistake i make !!!<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 5 2 4 2		nice hotel , nice location .<ssssss>room view<ssssss>
1 3 1 -1 1 -1 3 -1		smelly and cramped room hotel globus be a disgusting hotel .<ssssss>the bed linen be dirty and the view be of the trash pile below .<ssssss>it be smelly and the room be awkward and too small to even fit one large suitcase .<ssssss>what a terrible way to end a lovely tuscan vacation .<ssssss>the staff be helpful and the location be good but the hotel itself be a total dump .<ssssss>do i mention that it smell terrible ?<ssssss>i spend at least 100 night a year in hotel and this one be one of the worst .<ssssss>i can not believe the good review .<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 3 -1		damp depressing room this hotel look good when enter but the room we have be simply awful .<ssssss>it be very basic with no view but the worst aspect be it very damp and feel wet .<ssssss>we pay $ 114 for a day stopover which be a waste of money as we could not bear to stay in the depressing room and so glad we be not stay the night.the restaurant be okay and the outside pool be fairly good .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
1 1 1 3 1 3 2 -1		hate this hotel my partner and i hate this hotel so much we only stay one night instead of the 10 we would book .<ssssss>i would book a deluxe room and it be anything but .<ssssss>the room be extremely dark and you need light on during the day .<ssssss>we also find the room none-too-clean and the sheet be stain .<ssssss>the outside sit area be tiny and there be absolutely no privacy whatever .<ssssss>the bathroom be also very dark with a lethal slippery floor .<ssssss>the inside sit area , which make the room deluxe would have be like sit in a container ; it be horrible .<ssssss>we find the general attitude of the staff to be unfriendly .<ssssss>this hotel have a restrictive cancellation policy and we have to pay for a extra night for leave early but it be worth it to get out of there .<ssssss>they on-line rate be $ 80 we ; i later find a site quote $ 66 we and they do honour that rate -lrb- although they then refuse to do a airport pick-up -rrb- but in all honestly that be still way too much to pay for this third-rate properly .<ssssss>
4 3 5 -1 2 -1 4 -1		overall a good experience we find the w french quarter to be a clean , modern hotel with excellent staff .<ssssss>the bed , glass shower , huge bathroom and aveda product be heaven .<ssssss>it be fairly close to everything in the french quarter , the aquarium and harrah 's .<ssssss>the only thing i would recommend if you stay here be to request a room that do not face chartre street , as the street noise be terrible -lrb- garbage truck wake we up every morning at 4am -rrb- .<ssssss>also , if you expect you room to be clean every day you will be disappoint .<ssssss>we have a 4 night stay and we room be only clean once , but the staff be very prompt and helpful ; when we call the front desk to request anything they bring it immediately .<ssssss>they be also very helpful with direction and restaurant suggestion .<ssssss>another recommendation : the restaurant attach to the hotel -lrb- bacco -rrb- be not very good .<ssssss>extremely bland food ; there be so many great place to eat in new orlean , do not waste you money there !<ssssss>
2 2 4 3 5 1 1 -1		sterile hotel fita expect clean room , but not kind service from hotel fita.i and my fiancee book the place base on the positive review from the hotel .<ssssss>we book for a double room for one night last week.the seed of we problem be we late arrival at the airport .<ssssss>we do not take the taxi as be recommend and take the train to city center first , and be furthermore delay by a bad taxi driver who overcharge we .<ssssss>upon arrival at the hotel we be scold at length by the lady at the reception for be late and ` not listen to she ' .<ssssss>grant she have to wait 30 extra minute , but we have never receive such a treatment from a hotel management in we life .<ssssss>we want to run out of the place but it be too late to do so.for the hotel 's credit the room be clean although lack in style , double room consist of two twin bed , the no-smoking policy mean the hotel do not stink .<ssssss>breakfast be okay .<ssssss>service be meticulous , with han ensure that we get good , legal taxi -lrb- a lesson we learn the hard way indeed ! -rrb-<ssssss>through the hotel 's reservation service .<ssssss>as a veteran traveler i think a hotel management 's first virtue be kindness , not cleanliness .<ssssss>alas , that be what they lack .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 5 4 3 -1		nice hotel , shame about the noise this hotel have a lot of thing in its favour .<ssssss>it be very conveniently located , almost within sight of the st george metro station .<ssssss>the room we stay in be very clean , especially the bathroom , which put the bathroom of some 4-star hotel i have stay in to shame .<ssssss>the staff be friendly and helpful , the area be pleasant and we always feel safe when come and go to and from the hotel .<ssssss>the price of the room be good and there be a very handy little supermarket across the street for drink and snacks.so why only three star ?<ssssss>one word : noise .<ssssss>there be some external noise if you room be located on the street-facing side of the hotel , but no more than you would expect in a busy city like paris .<ssssss>it be the noise from inside the hotel that be the real problem .<ssssss>during we visit we be treat to all manner of nocturnal disturbance , include a woman yodel , laugh and shout into the early hour , and shriek from the upper floor the cause of which i would not like to imagine .<ssssss>on top of this , there be the constant door slamming .<ssssss>the room have the kind of door you might find in office building , and have no sound insulation whatsoever .<ssssss>whenever anyone slam they door -lrb- and we fellow guest seem incapable of simply close they door -rrb- the sound would travel through the entire building .<ssssss>not much help after midnight when you be try to sleep.basically , if you can sleep through any amount of racket or be prepare to invest in a set of industrial strength ear-plug then this could be the perfect parisian hotel for you .<ssssss>however , if noise be something that be go to bother you , you might want to look at other option .<ssssss>it be a shame really , as this one aspect let down what would otherwise be a real gem of a hotel .<ssssss>
2 3 4 2 4 1 1 3		the worst , barely sleep , bad service too ... the room in this place be nice , comfortable , and clean .<ssssss>the service be awful and the room i have be right off the street and very loud , you could hear car , music , and people all night long .<ssssss>this be not a hotel for any one who actually want to sleep in they room .<ssssss>.<ssssss>every morning around 8am the maid would bang on the door with the cord to the vacum cleaner and see if you want you room to be clean if not they skip it ... you could hear the maid in the hallway from 8-2pm talk very loudly with music playing from they cart ... i also ask the reception for information on get a shuttle to the airport and he look at I like i ask for he first bear and hand I a phone book ???<ssssss>pro - clean and comfortable room , close to ala moana mall , free internetcon - poor service , loud , staff very unorganized and rude , location not so nice .<ssssss>
4 -1 4 3 4 5 5 3		good value for the $ we stay in a king room with microwave and bar fridge .<ssssss>my wife and i find the room very clean , quiet and the bed be comfortable .<ssssss>extra pillow be promptly provide when request .<ssssss>the first night we eat in houlihan the hotel restaurant and enjoy the meal .<ssssss>the hotel be extremely easy to find and the highway access be right across the street so travel to sf or south to san jose / monterey be quick and no hassle .<ssssss>part of the time we be without a rental car but the include shuttle service get we to the bart station at sfo in a matter of minute .<ssssss>the $ 5 fare to the embarcadero/union sq. be a bargain consider the high cost of parking in those area and take less time than drive .<ssssss>staff be cordial and helpful in provide travel tips/directions .<ssssss>when we ask for restaurant location at the front desk they print out yahoo map for we convenience : -rrb- we room be spotless on we return each day .<ssssss>check in and out be quick .<ssssss>the location be a bit remote in that other than other hotel and the nearby ihop there be nothing within walk distance .<ssssss>we have no complaint about we stay here and would definitely recommend this hotel for the value we believe we receive<ssssss>
3 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		great location - average hotel be there in feburary , and yes , after a long flight on iberium the room be not ready and it take a additional 4 hour for it to be finish and find ourselves in the extension .<ssssss>lobby look tired and be very small .<ssssss>room be small , on the inside , and we be unable the turn down the heat that blow at hot no matter what be done.only way to lower the tempurture be to open the window .<ssssss>room be nicely decorate though .<ssssss>we do not eat at the hotel so i can not tell you about the food .<ssssss>housekeeping be very friendly ; i be have a really bad day and they make I laugh so hard i be cry , but the desk girl give we a look because we be go to share a bed .<ssssss>lot of business people but have no problem with them.the biggest grip be the overly confusing light switch !<ssssss>we never do figure out how they work !<ssssss>we usually stay at the gran vina but could not get in and someone recommend this place .<ssssss>we most likely will not stay here again and will try the majestic if the other place be not available .<ssssss>great location -lrb- and housekeeping staff ! -rrb-<ssssss>but that be all .<ssssss>
2 3 1 5 1 3 2 3		ugh !<ssssss>will not come back for the second time we book this hotel w/o read much review .<ssssss>then after read all the negative review , it be already too late to change .<ssssss>so we decide to go with it and hope for the best .<ssssss>the hotel lobby be nice , spacious , airy as mention by other poster .<ssssss>the ground and facility be well maintain .<ssssss>staff be always clean .<ssssss>beach be gorgeous , we would definitely come back to punta cana for the beach -lrb- stay at a different hotel thou -rrb- .<ssssss>now i will go to detail of the negative : food : only 2 a la carte restaurant to choose from for each day .<ssssss>i think they alternate those 4 restaurant .<ssssss>d'oriental be suppose to be the best but it be not at all .<ssssss>food be tasteless and bland .<ssssss>the decor be not great either .<ssssss>we try the italian restaurant and food be bad as well .<ssssss>chicken and lasagna be very dry .<ssssss>basically , food and service be cafeteria standard .<ssssss>on we last nite , we go to the lobster sea side restaurant -lrb- it be not in the all-inclusive package .<ssssss>it be $ 45 per person -rrb- .<ssssss>we both order lobster and they be great .<ssssss>the restaurant ambiance be very nice .<ssssss>this be what i think all restaurant and they food should be like .<ssssss>room : ac be not work .<ssssss>the room be musky and floor be not clean .<ssssss>we see ant everywhere .<ssssss>once , there be some on the bed .<ssssss>they do come and spray the room but it do not help much.bathroom : the tub be disgusting .<ssssss>overall , i do not recommend this resort at all .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 3 5 4 4		2-3star hotel with great service i book via hotwire b/c they state this hotel be a 3?1/2 star hotel .<ssssss>i would rate this hotel as 2-3 star max .<ssssss>it do have a small bar area and a restaurant which be ok .<ssssss>breakfast be 9 euro .<ssssss>you be better serve to walk into the underground subway station by the irish pub and get a snack or go to burger king and save the euro .<ssssss>the staff be super efficient , friendly , and helpful .<ssssss>4 star staff .<ssssss>internet computer for free in the lobby .<ssssss>quiet room and maybe a bit expensive at $ 130 usd , but i would stay here again , i would just know it be a 2?1/2 star hotel .<ssssss>restaurant and bar do not mean too much to me.being next to the train station be awesome .<ssssss>red light district and its element be overrate as bad in this area .<ssssss>i would not let this fact deter you since it be not as in you face as i worry about .<ssssss>you can easily bypass this area and not worry about it so stay here with confidence .<ssssss>there be a le meriden around the corner so you know the hotel 's know this area be good for traveller .<ssssss>
3 3 5 3 5 3 4 -1		relax and live up to expectation my boyfriend and i stay in this hotel in feb 2008 for one week .<ssssss>we be in we late 20 and want to go leave london for a relaxing week in the sun , which be what we get !<ssssss>from the minute we get to the hotel to when we have to leave i be in a very relax holiday mood without worry or concern -lrb- could have be the rum , though ... -rrb- .<ssssss>the hotel be clean and most of the staff very friendly .<ssssss>the entire hotel area , which be quite big , be very nicely look after and you could go for stroll and look at the flower and bird .<ssssss>i be slightly worried that there would not be enough thing to do , but there be plenty .<ssssss>the good thing be that you can do just as little or as much as you want , so you can customise you holiday that way.saona island be a must !<ssssss>this one day trip be something you can not miss as you will visit a paradise island and enjoy a beautiful boatride .<ssssss>other thing we do be to go for a little shopping trip -lrb- not recommend -rrb- and to go on speed boat and snorkel -lrb- good -rrb- and in the hotel we play tennis , have a massage and go paragliding.the reason i be -lrb- in spite of all the good thing -rrb- not give this hotel a higher rating than a 3 -lrb- would do 3.5 if possible -rrb- be that the beach be not as nice as we expect and this be important to we as we be not big fan of the pool .<ssssss>also , the wine be terrible so i suggest you bring you own if you be not happy to drink beer or cocktail for a week .<ssssss>the food in the main restaurant be ok , there be always something you could eat , but it be not great .<ssssss>we try one of the other restaurant one night but it be just awful , so do not bother try to book one of those!overall , i have a feeling many of the hotel be quite similar in this area , and there really be not anything wrong with this one even though it be not perfect and it may be too big to give you a luxury feeling but we do have a really nice stay anyway .<ssssss>
5 2 5 4 5 5 5 3		great hotel , very expensive book through starwood which be probably a mistake .<ssssss>they be unclear as to the final price of the stay .<ssssss>they only quote one night 's price and state that that price be for the entire stay.hotel itself be very nice .<ssssss>the room be elegant , well lay out and have plenty of light .<ssssss>all the control be fully automate and be accessible via a remote by the bed .<ssssss>the bathroom be spacious and the shower feature a rainfall shower head and a seat area in the shower along with a separate bath area .<ssssss>the concierge be helpful along with the front desk .<ssssss>everyone be very courteous and service be excellent .<ssssss>only blemish would be the lady who come by to fluff we bed .<ssssss>she ignore we do not disturb light and walk right in .<ssssss>i suppose that get a bed fluff might be important to some people but it be rather a nuisance to have someone just barge in .<ssssss>the restaurant below , ame , be _ ok _ but not as good as some review would have it .<ssssss>the staff there be also excellent and helpful although we waiter disappear for long period of time to talk ot 2 -lrb- single ? -rrb-<ssssss>female eat together .<ssssss>he seem to enjoy talk to they quite a bit which deter from the otherwise great service.the elevator be quick and we only have to share it once with one other couple .<ssssss>they be well time and calibrate so you barely notice the acceleration and deceleration of the elevator.the indoor pool , outdoor lounge area , indoor lounge area and the fitness center be top notch although the indoor pool can be a bit tricky to find .<ssssss>that may have be the reason why it be empty when we go which be a boon for us.parking be valet only and internet be not free .<ssssss>there be supposedly a business center but we never could find it.but for all this there be a price to be pay .<ssssss>at the original price of $ 800 / night for we room , it would be very hard to justify stay there .<ssssss>i be sure you can get cheaper rate than that as the price may have be inflate due to the all star game .<ssssss>still very hard to justify when other great hotel be in the general location at 1/3 the price .<ssssss>

2 3 2 5 3 5 5 3		great but ... the best thing about this resort be the beautiful grounds , a exceptionally friendly and helpful staff and the beautiful beach-side bar area .<ssssss>if you need to be on the west side of puerto rico , between mayaguez and isabella , this be the best place to stay .<ssssss>however , we have find the best beach and resort on vieque island near san juan .<ssssss>we stay in a one bedroom downstairs villa that be larger than the ciff room but still pretty small .<ssssss>the full size bed be squeeky , hard and have see better day -- we do not get a single good night 's sleep ... villa need some maintenance.with all of the awesome restaurant review we think that the eclipse would be great -- however , the whole time we wonder if perhaps they have change chef .<ssssss>the food be ok but certainly not worth we time even though the restaurant itself be breathtaking -- we find great fresh local fare at luna marina down the road .<ssssss>

2 2 2 5 3 2 1 3		it could be delightful but ... we stay twice - a week apart - at this hotel and have almost exactly the same experience each time which motivate I to write this review .<ssssss>the convenient location just ten minute drive from the airport and right on a very nice stretch of beach have let this hotel get away with the huge flaw the management do not seem to want to do anything about .<ssssss>a former 50 's motel with tiny room , it be be tidy up and freshen with simple cosmetic .<ssssss>the room , though tiny , be clean enough , but the window be hermetically seal , and the very loud air conditioning compete with the non stop blare noise from the on site disco which make sleep a challenge , even on a sunday night .<ssssss>the biggest shortcoming at the beach house hotel be the poor quality of service by the staff who , though pleasant , be either clueless , disorganized , or incompetent , and need training , guidance or replacement .<ssssss>the follow be just a few example : we sit for nearly a hour at the outdoor restaurant try to get someone to take we order , and when we try to use the one-free-drink-coupon we receive at check-in , be tell it apply to only one wine selection and one beer selection ... no special drink like pina colada or daquiri .<ssssss>we salad arrive without dress and we still have no fork , knife or napkin .<ssssss>it take so long to get utensil we start to eat the salad with we finger .<ssssss>there be not very many patron in the restaurant , but the one table that be receive a lot of attention be where the owner and he family be eat .<ssssss>the owner get up to do thing a number of time but never notice we be not be attend to .<ssssss>finally we utensil arrive and we order the saffron color seafood paella which we see at the owner 's table and make a point of tell we waiter we want exactly that paella -lrb- because the week before we have order the seafood paella and after a very long wait have be serve a mixed paella with bit of sausage and meat instead ... we be so hungry we eat it anyway -rrb- .<ssssss>we have be seat for almost two hour when we be serve we seafood paella which be not like the owner 's at all .<ssssss>no golden saffron color rice like what he be eat ... instead meager piece of fish and seafood in a bed of overly salted , greasy rice , a disappointment which we express to the waiter who shrug he shoulder and say it be not he fault .<ssssss>again , we be hungry and eat it anyway .<ssssss>only one of the dessert on the menu be available and no coffee because the coffee machine be break .<ssssss>we actually wonder if we be on a candid camera show because we be be so poorly serve and treat , we think it could not be for real ... but it be !<ssssss>at breakfast -lrb- which be include in the price of the room -rrb- , there be coffee -lrb- different coffee maker ? -rrb-<ssssss>but no milk for the cold cereal or coffee , and the fruit be so far past its prime it be moment away from rotten .<ssssss>the waiter be pleasant but say sorry we be out of milk .<ssssss>there be a 7eleven across the street , why would they be out of milk ?<ssssss>at breakfast during we previous stay the week before , the strawberry , pineapple , and cantaloupe be rot ripe , but the grape be good , but this week there be no grape ... and no milk .<ssssss>this hotel/restaurant experience be unnecessarily bad and not worth the price we pay .<ssssss>the beach setting be very nice , but it be only worth stay at the beach house hotel if you do not care about eat or sleep there .<ssssss>

2 2 2 4 3 1 3 3		very over-rated we have stay at many upscale hotel , both in the we and in europe , and we be very disappointed with the four season .<ssssss>this be the first time that we stay in a four season , previously stay more in the ritz carlton hotel , so we decide to give it a try .<ssssss>first , we have to wait for we room and we be not the only one .<ssssss>it be not ready until a hour after check-in and then the original room that we request be not offer to we .<ssssss>to compensate , they direct we to the lounge and invite we to have a complimentary drink .<ssssss>initially , they have say something about upgrade we due to we wait but this never happen and unfortunately , we do not push it .<ssssss>i have not be feel well and all i really want to do be get into we room .<ssssss>the check-in process be definitely unpleasant .<ssssss>also , there be no wow factor to this hotel .<ssssss>when you be spend upward of $ 500.00 a night for a deluxe garden view room , i be expect some kind of luxurious room .<ssssss>the linen on the bed be just ok , the bathroom be a tub/shower combination with a shower curtain -lrb- glass enclosure be much classier and less claustrophobic -rrb- , there be only one sink in the bathroom and the room be not overly large .<ssssss>also , one of the courtesy bathrobe 's be dirty .<ssssss>there be spot on many of the chair in the bristol lounge and on the chair in the lobby .<ssssss>this be unacceptable as far as we be concern .<ssssss>we definitely feel that some major upgrading should be do in order to classify this as a upscale hotel .<ssssss>

1 2 3 1 4 1 1 1		friendly hotel staff would have go a long way the location be not ideal for someone look to explore the city .<ssssss>it be too far away and consider the cost of transportation in amsterdam , a hotel in the city be a better option.the staff be not very friendly and to I they seem to always wear sour face , whcih be a surprise since everywhere else in amsterdam , everyone i meet be extremely friendly and helpful .<ssssss>a smile will go a long way to make hotel guest feel more comfortable.the staff and manageent be also dishonest .<ssssss>i be expect a package from hamburg and for two day i be follow up with management if the package have arrive .<ssssss>all i get be a response that no package have arrive and i have to check out of the hotel without the package .<ssssss>surprise , surprise ... i later find out from the delivery company that the package be not accept by the staff for some unknown reason .<ssssss>all along , someone make a mistake of refuse to accept the package on my behalf but they could not own up to the mistake and tell I what have happen .<ssssss>
4 3 4 3 4 1 4 -1		nice , but unpleasant front desk the front desk be the front door in term of customer service and it just amaze that some hotel do not get this .<ssssss>i book one night with my hilton point and then book two more pay night .<ssssss>i do this on the hilton website and i clearly add comment with each separate reservation that they should ensure i do not have to change room when i arrive .<ssssss>my wife and i arrive and check in and the woman checking in be less than pleasant , and then proceed to tell I that i would have to come back the next day before 6 p.m. to get a new key , but she keep I in the same room .<ssssss>she say this as if she be do I a favor .<ssssss>it be just a amazing attitude when i be longtime hilton honor member .<ssssss>i ask she what be the point of I add the comment in the reservation form ?<ssssss>do you read those or not ?<ssssss>incredible .<ssssss>i walk out to the car and ask my wife if she find the woman rude , and she immediately agree .<ssssss>unfortunately , she do not have a name tag .<ssssss>the rest of the stay be pleasant enough , as be the room , the pool area and the golf course , -lrb- and we be pleasantly surprise by the generally good quality of the food at the restaurant , and we cook and eat out frequently -rrb- but what do i remember ?<ssssss>my experience at the front desk when i check in .<ssssss>
1 2 2 5 4 3 1 3		my wedding my family i visit this resort in august 2004 .<ssssss>this resort be beautiful , clean , and the beach be everything you could imagen .<ssssss>front lobby have two grand stair case .<ssssss>exotic flower and furniture .<ssssss>after travel and the bus ride , we arrive at the resort and we wedding guest and i be in awe .<ssssss>staff be very polite , although it take roughly a hour to get to we room .<ssssss>when we book 6 month earlier we request the honeymoon suite as the wedding couple .<ssssss>but be give a ocean view room with two double bed .<ssssss>the view be breath taking .<ssssss>but we room be nothing special for a bride and groom .<ssssss>we speak with front desk and they say they could not help we with a room change .<ssssss>i find this to be of poor service to the bride and groom who undoubt should have a honeymoon suite.we have a wonderful time with family and friend through the first two day .<ssssss>then on the 3rd day we be inform we wedding which we have book for 5pm sunset on the beach for august 25th .<ssssss>be move ahead to august 24th .<ssssss>we have plan to have we wedding date on my father birthday since he have pass away and could not attend .<ssssss>this be disappointing , and again the hotel would not assist we in keep the same date as plan .<ssssss>also my fatherâs identical twin brother who walk I down the aisle be very upset in the change of date .<ssssss>the day of the wedding i go to the salon spa to have a gel nail repair and paint before the wedding while i be get my hair do .<ssssss>the girl in the spa have not see a gel nail product before , but insist they could fix it .<ssssss>the one girl tear the gel nail off but do so also remove most of my actual nail .<ssssss>this be my ring finger .<ssssss>i feel a panic start to set in , and they continue to tell I it be ok ... and they could still fix it .<ssssss>i be in pain , but also worry that as my ring finger be bare of a nail .<ssssss>i ask they to do something .<ssssss>so i place a small band aid over my open nail bed .<ssssss>and they glue a spare nail find in a vase to the band aid with hot glue .<ssssss>then paint this to match my other nail .<ssssss>i be horrify .<ssssss>i really do not know how to react .<ssssss>i leave the spa before have my hair finish .<ssssss>this be truely the worst service at a spa anyone could ever recive.also the morning of the wedding we be inform that the resort staff could not set up the beach for we wedding , as they say weather could turn at any moment .<ssssss>they then decorate the lobby balcony for we wedding .<ssssss>my uncle speak with the hotel manager and tell he we do not fly 20 guest at $ 1100.00 each to hold we wedding inside a building .<ssssss>so we be able to continue the wedding on the beach without flower or chairs.we pay $ 1200 we upon arrival at the resort for we wedding package , which we be tell include a wedding coordinator .<ssssss>but of course we be tell the wedding coordinator be away on business that week .<ssssss>everything i pick out from the book be not do for we .<ssssss>include type of flower .<ssssss>i pick a local exotic flower in a small bouquet .<ssssss>i get large peach rose that be weave into a flower display that go to the floor .<ssssss>the hire judge do not correctly say we name .<ssssss>but we proceed anyways .<ssssss>we do hire a band for a extra $ 375 we .<ssssss>which be worth every penny .<ssssss>they play music on the beach for the wedding , and then follow we to the beach bar where we socialize with family as the play beautifully .<ssssss>during dinner they play the entire time .<ssssss>and also play 5 song for we to dance too .<ssssss>although the dinner it be self be great from what i hear .<ssssss>i myself the bride do not get a meal ... and family i all inform waiter staff three time , then be tell the kitchen be close .<ssssss>this be all in a hour and half from the start of dinner the day after the wedding , i go to the safe to get some of my thing , and my austrian crystal martini necklace and match earring , with emerald and ruby olive on they be go .<ssssss>this be my wedding gift from my husband .<ssssss>i run to the front desk to report this , but be tell nobody could speak english and i would have to come back later .<ssssss>i keep go back every 10 min and ask to speak to the manager rueben .<ssssss>nobody could speak english when i need to report the theft .<ssssss>but on a different occasion i go to the front desk and ask for a room key to my motherâs room .<ssssss>they hand I one key with no question ask .<ssssss>this make I very uncomfortable as i only request a room number and not even by name .<ssssss>this resort be very beautiful and the beach be even more amazing .<ssssss>but hotel staff be impossible and i feel very disappointed even with all the excitement of we wedding .<ssssss>the more time that have pass i feel more rob of what should have be a amazing trip and celebration .<ssssss>i will not recommend this place to anyone planning to get marry .<ssssss>or look for a place with great staff .<ssssss>if you be look for a beautiful hotel and beach this be the place to go .<ssssss>do not bring anything you value , because they safe be not a safe place to store thing either.other wedding guest stay at the hotel also report theft of item , high heel , clothing , and money leave in shirt pocket from visit the beach market .<ssssss>my family be very easy go , and despite all this ... we still look back and say what a great time .<ssssss>and laugh about all the mis-hap ... but in all honesty no vacation or wedding should have this many problem .<ssssss>
5 4 5 4 3 2 3 3		love the marriott marquis i be a bit unsure about this location due to the possibility of noise .<ssssss>we have a room on the 30th floor .<ssssss>it be very quiet and we have no complaint .<ssssss>everything exceed we expectations.the only negative would be that it take more time that it should have at check in .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 4 -1 4 -1		ok , good start , but some disappointment book in to le lavoisier on the strength of the review on here .<ssssss>first impression be good - very friendly staff , the lady who greet we , fabienne i think be she name - be very friendly .<ssssss>the room be ok , quite small but clean and seem ok .<ssssss>despite there be shutter however , the room be very noisey - it be right at the end of a side road , off a busy road , so it actually might aswell be on the main road .<ssssss>car noise most of the night unfortunately .<ssssss>the second day we go for a meal in the evening arrange by the hotel as a package which be good , and good value .<ssssss>on we return to the hotel we go into the hotel bar , which be actually a small room .<ssssss>we be direct towards a cupboard and tell to help ourself to beer or wine .<ssssss>i take a bottle of fairly basic muscadet ; we have to go to we room as the night porter be watch tv in the bar .<ssssss>i be quite surprised and disappointed next morning to find i have be charge 30e for the wine ; a similar bottle be sell next door to the hotel at a supermarket for about 4e !!<ssssss>.<ssssss>overall the hotel be fair , nothing special , probably wouldnt go back , and my view be that the review on here be wrong when they say it be a quiet hotel .<ssssss>

have pay for .<ssssss>these be cheaper , smaller room with no view !<ssssss>we have no other option but to accept it and move on.as of today , they have not yet reimburse we the difference!they do smile and apologize in the end and promise they would make it up to we during we stay .<ssssss>they also say they would send 3 fruit basket to we room as apology gift .<ssssss>you can probably guess that we never receive anything !<ssssss>the problem be not the miss record , but that no one care enough to take charge to try to resolve the problem .<ssssss>they keep we stand for 3 hour at front desk , thirsty , hot and exhaust and nervous .<ssssss>we ask for at least water to drink and they keep say sure , we have phone the bar and they will bring you some water in a minute !<ssssss>, but it never arrive .<ssssss>all the check in trouble aside , the major problem be the security in this resort : before i go into detail , please note that no local be involve in any of the incident and all the troublemaker be among hotel guest / tourist .<ssssss>also , the local police/judge be extremely professional and helpful .<ssssss>there be fist fight over chair next to the pool and towel almost regularly .<ssssss>the security staff do too little to supervise or break the fight .<ssssss>as if they only job be to just hang out , dance and joke with guest and nothing more !<ssssss>the incident be too frequent and too violent to ignore .<ssssss>my husband and i personally witness two incident of violence attack -lrb- one against a young lady -rrb- and one theft which end in violence , all in front of security staff right at the pool side in the middle of the day .<ssssss>my husband , i and my brother in law bring they up to the manager 's attention at different point of time .<ssssss>we decide to report it to local police , since management refuse to take any report on anything regard security .<ssssss>the general manager try to stop we from report to the police .<ssssss>he try to stop we from call the police by refuse to give we the local law enforcement contact number .<ssssss>the general manager simply put it this way : if the police get involve , it will hurt my hotel reputation !<ssssss>we take it in we own hand with some other guest -lrb- two nice couple from latin america and one from europe -rrb- and rent a car to the closest police station to report the situation at the resort .<ssssss>we be receive by the local judge after a hour wait .<ssssss>she hear we case and order the police to check on the situation in the hotel and investigate/question the hotel security staff about the management cover up .<ssssss>she mention the tourist ' security be a priority in punta cana due to the scale of tourism industry in that region .<ssssss>police force show up at the hotel quickly to talk to the hotel staff and guest regard the cover up of violence and theft case .<ssssss>the manager have to listen and take the guest complaint seriously this time!after arrest a few guest and interview witness who come forward , the judge order one group of guest immediate deportation from the resort which be enforce by police the next morning!we could not wait to get out of there , thank god we be home safe and sound .<ssssss>let I repeat 2 important note in the end : first , all of the criminal be among tourist , not locals.secondly , the action of punta cana law enforcement and judge be very quick , professional and efficient.they really take tourism security very seriously .<ssssss>we will definitely go back to beautiful and peaceful punta cana , dominican republic .<ssssss>though we would not go back to bavaro iberostar.i would not recommend this particular resort to woman , family , or elderly .<ssssss>it be a unsafe , disorganized and poorly manage resort .<ssssss>
2 1 3 -1 4 -1 1 -1		huge disappointment !<ssssss>several girlfriend and i stay here for a friendâs wedding .<ssssss>although we request adjoining room several time before we arrival , we request be not honor .<ssssss>after two request and 45 minute of wait after be tell they be deliver we luggage , we bag remain unattended in the front lobby .<ssssss>service at the pool restaurant be unbelievably slow and we never even receive we complete order .<ssssss>afternoon tea be a disaster .<ssssss>half of we be not give plate and have to use we saucer for the food .<ssssss>tea be strain for only a select few , the other have loose tea float in they cup .<ssssss>again , very un-ritz-like service .<ssssss>on we second day , one of we be take the other guest ' order at the poolside grill and another have to help work the grill!the fitness center be adequate , however the ârelaxation roomâ?for the spa be upstairs with only a curtain to drown out the noise â?hardly relax .<ssssss>worse , one of my friend could hear the music clearly during she massage !<ssssss>four different mysterious dining charge to we room , which be remove promptly upon question.housekeeping be wonderful â?delightful woman â?nearly the only friendly and accommodate member of the staff that we encounter .<ssssss>aside from the actual wedding , which be lovely and very well execute by the staff , this be not you typical ritz experience .<ssssss>we be able to find humor in be disappoint over and over again , but not worth over $ 500 per night for holiday inn quality .<ssssss>
3 3 5 4 4 2 2 5		very odd stay at the vibe the room be very nice .<ssssss>the hotel in general be fine .<ssssss>the location be good , walk to darling harbour , central station and a longer walk to circular key.the roof top pool be nice if small .<ssssss>we use it twice and the first time be fine.the second time we use it on the last day of we stay be not satisfactory at all .<ssssss>a odd couple be have sex in the pool .<ssssss>they be not guest of the hotel and one be in she underwear .<ssssss>ourselves and another unconnected family complain to hotel staff several time but no one come up .<ssssss>eventually the general manager come up , and go away again do nothing .<ssssss>we be horrify and complain again so he come back up and confront and remove the couple .<ssssss>he say the hotel would drain the pool but i see no sign of this and the pool remain open with other patron use the soil pool!disgusting .<ssssss>

3 3 4 2 2 4 5 -1		standard old botique hotel i think all the positive , and negative , describe here be true .<ssssss>it be a quaint , maybe quirky old hotel in a decent location .<ssssss>nicely decorate and excellent personal service .<ssssss>the breakfast be good , although the hot item be lukewarm .<ssssss>the bed be comfortable .<ssssss>yes , the fixture be old , wood/tile floor be old , there be some rust in the bathroom .<ssssss>if this bug you , do not book here .<ssssss>my biggest complaint be the street noise in the second floor room .<ssssss>about every hour , we awake to a new sound : car horn , loud talk on the street , argue , garbage truck , tire skid , etc. i write the hotel and recommend that they get dual paned window .<ssssss>the hotel reply that i should have ask for a higher floor .<ssssss>so , if this be the kind of place for you , either wear excellent earplug at night or get as high of a floor as possible .<ssssss>
2 2 2 -1 4 -1 3 -1		just okay , nothing special ... .<ssssss>well i will say that i be nervous about go to this hotel after read the review but we do go w / a open mind .<ssssss>on a positive note , the surround be beautiful , the beach be very relaxing and just gorgeous , it be always clean and the water be ice blue .<ssssss>we do go out faily early in the morning to take we place on the beach since i be travel w / small child i want the option of shade .<ssssss>the employee be very pleasant and always say , hello .<ssssss>they also go out of they way to say hello to my child .<ssssss>my child -lrb- 19 month and 3 year old -rrb- love the show at night , they get on stage and dance to the music.now onto the not so good thing , we do request a room w / a adjoining door so that my inlaw could help w / the child .<ssssss>there be 15 of we travel together .<ssssss>the front desk claim that there be no such room .<ssssss>after go back and forth we have ask to speak w / a manager and somehow when the manager appear there be several room that be available w / adjoining door .<ssssss>when we get to we room i do not notice the smell that some people have mention but several people we be with do claim that there room do have a odor to it .<ssssss>the room be okay , nothing special , infact the shower head be fall off the wall , after call the front desk and ask they fix it , we get feed up w / wait and my husband fix it instead , by the way , no one ever do ask we about it again .<ssssss>i also have a request for a crib , i be not expect a new crib by any means but this crib have certain be through a lot of child .<ssssss>if you be bring a toddler that need a cib take my advice and bring extra crib sheet -lrb- which i do -rrb- to wrap around the mattress .<ssssss>if you be there for more than a few day you be go to get sick of the food .<ssssss>i be only there from a friday till a tuesday and could not wait to eat american food again .<ssssss>there be always french fries and pizza and you can get that anytime .<ssssss>you do have to be careful what we eat due to the thing that be wash in water .<ssssss>although they say the hotel 's water be purify you still need to be careful , there be still some trace of bacterium in the water .<ssssss>that be why they give you a ton of water in you room .<ssssss>infact , they only recommend you just brush you tooth , not swallow the water .<ssssss>this information be from a brochure we get in the lobby of the hotel .<ssssss>out of 15 of we 7 of we be ill w / vomit and diarrhea .<ssssss>my 2 little one get very sick but i be really not sure if it be from there or a virus , either way it be bad news .<ssssss>we do eat at a few of the specialty restaurant -lrb- the steak place , the japanese , and the louisiana -rrb- .<ssssss>i can not say anything special about they , the steak be horrible , especially if you have ever be to a decent steak place back at home .<ssssss>i do not recommend eat the hamburger or hot dog for that matter , i do not even let my child eat it .<ssssss>i order room service one night -lrb- a pizza -rrb- they tell I 20 minute and 2 hour later i have to call back .<ssssss>that be the same night i turn on my light to check on the daughter and a roach run across the bed .<ssssss>on a final note the alcohol be horrible and nothing close to be drinkable .<ssssss>yes , there be champagne but it be very cheap and you would not want to drink more of a glass of it to begin with .<ssssss>there speciality drink be freeze until you add alcohol to they and they it turn to almost water.the bottom line be we will not be go back .<ssssss>i have be to several island and although like i mention the surround be beautiful at punta cana , it do not compare to the other place we have travel .<ssssss>
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 4		terrible stay we stay this year for mardi gra almost ruin the entire trip .<ssssss>the hotel be turn into a frat house â?dirty room , grimy floor that never get vacuum , pile up trash in the hall , overwhelmed and confused staff , and non-existent security .<ssssss>one elevator break on friday night and the staff never fix it , cause 10-20 minute line at the elevator for the entire weekend .<ssssss>drunk kid scream all night .<ssssss>on saturday night someone pull the fire alarm at 2 am , cause we to walk down 20 floor of stair only to wait 20 minute for the elevator to return to the room .<ssssss>i wish i have think to take picture of this dump .<ssssss>terrible , terrible hotel â?stay away .<ssssss>
3 3 2 4 2 5 4 4		trendy , but not quite my cup of tea .<ssssss>
5 4 3 -1 3 -1 5 -1		you will probably either love this hotel or hate it we love the hotel .<ssssss>there be two reason why :1 .<ssssss>first it have character .<ssssss>the decor be victorian and it be pack with item from that period .<ssssss>we really enjoy sit in the main lounge area in the early evening have a glass of the complementary sherry and biscuit and for the first two night watch the start of the ghost tour which meet at the hotel at 7pm .<ssssss>the bedroom be old fashion in style but this might not suit everyone .<ssssss>there be no tea/coffee facility in the room but the hotel usually have tea/coffee available in the lounge which i prefer .2 .<ssssss>the staff .<ssssss>they be very helpful with suggestion on where to eat and other useful advice.the location in pacific height be good for access to all part of the city .<ssssss>we choose to walk which be not too difficult as the weather be not too hot .<ssssss>but there be many bus and cab available if require .<ssssss>the hotel have its own carpark just over the road which be very helpful.we eat out at different place for each of the 3 night we stay there .<ssssss>the first night we try the fillmore grill which be fine and quite close , then pasta pomodoro in the nearby japan area which be a friendly italian and serve great food at excellent price and finally the lemongrass thai restaurant in polk st - further away but great food and large portions.finally the only critisism we have be the breakfast - choice be limit to melon , cake and toast plus tea/coffee/juice .<ssssss>
3 3 4 3 4 1 3 1		not the best .<ssssss>at the beach<ssssss>
3 2 3 5 3 5 5 -1		not quite as expect i read nearly every review of hix here on tripadvisor , so i have a pretty good idea of what to expect .<ssssss>the reservation be easy to make and the staff helpful ; we enjoy vieque and will return but not to hix .<ssssss>i give serious consideration to 3 star vs 4 but ultimately decide on 3 give a few serious flaw and my feeling that the price be not in accordance with the product.the good : the location be beautiful , peaceful , quiet , charming , bird chirp ... the front desk staff be extraordinarily helpful and pleasant .<ssssss>the bread/fruit/butter / juice/coffee provide daily be a nice treat .<ssssss>the pool be lovely .<ssssss>the bed be very , very comfortable .<ssssss>nice linen , nice robe , nice cotton shirt to wear during you stay be provide .<ssssss>amazing view .<ssssss>the outdoor shower -lrb- we be in loft 5 -rrb- be great .<ssssss>they have provide many thing for you comfort and convenience , such as beach chair , bug spray , candle , board game to check out , a book exchange library in each room , umbrella to check out , a listing of local menu , et cetera.the bad : i know hix focus on privacy , nature , and eco-friendliness .<ssssss>however , there be certain thing that i personally expect when stay at a place that while not exorbitant , be not exactly cheap either .<ssssss>i know there be no maid service daily and so be not surprised -lrb- although i think for the price it should be provide - who want to make they own bed on vacation ? -rrb-<ssssss>the shower be heat by solar power and apparently also have a gas implement to bring the water to 120 degree if it be not already .<ssssss>this feature do not seem to work very well -lrb- intermittently -rrb- and at its hottest still be not hot enough for myself or my husband -lrb- who usually prefer much cooler shower than I ... -rrb- the other disturbing problem be we toilet .<ssssss>it be a nice , fairly new toilet -lrb- kohler i think ? -rrb-<ssssss>with a very old , raggedy , stain plastic seat and lid combination that loook like it have be bring in from a airport bathroom .<ssssss>i do not know why but the whole toilet smell very badly of urine -lrb- sometimes you could even get a whiff as you walk right outside the bathroom -rrb- and be very unpleasant .<ssssss>i do mention this to the manager after the first night who immediately send a very cheerful and hardworking housekeeper to remedy the situation .<ssssss>she scrub away and it smell good ... for about a hour .<ssssss>i have also mention the shower heating issue to he and he explain to I how to use the faucet a little better to get hotter water -lrb- which help a little . -rrb-<ssssss>i guess my perception of hot water be perhaps different than most , so i do not bring it up again but if you like really hot shower and it could be a dealbreaker for you , consider yourself warn .<ssssss>i also do not revisit the toilet issue because clearly she scrubbing although temporarily effective be not get at whatever the issue be -lrb- i do not think it be she fault , i think it be something scrub would not fix -rrb- and i be pretty sure it be not go to get resolve before we leave .<ssssss>my husband mention that the seat would not stay up -lrb- as a female i have no idea about this -rrb- and this be also awkward for him.the neutral : i know that a/c be unavailable but do think that it would get a bit cooler at night than it do .<ssssss>we do not sleep well .<ssssss>i also know that there be not a jacuzzi so that be okay , but again , i be surprise that a place that bill itself as a fairly high end accomodation do not have one .<ssssss>make sure to rent a jeep if you be stay here -lrb- or anywhere in vieque for that matter . -rrb-<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3 5 -1 3		great view and price .<ssssss>sunset from the balcony<ssssss>
1 3 1 4 4 3 2 -1		dream bed , not !!!<ssssss>we book to stay 3 night at this hotel .<ssssss>check in go smoothly and the room seem clean and quite nice .<ssssss>the first problem be everytime we turn on the on the air conditioning , it give a loud rattle / bang noise for about 30 second , but eventually work , until the 3rd night when it apparently burn out , so do not work at all .<ssssss>the next problem , every afternoon when return from we day of sightseeing we would try to reenter we room but be lock out , so have to go back down in the lift and get issue with a new card to get back in to we room .<ssssss>the biggest problem be the so call dream bed , we be sleep on spring .<ssssss>housekeeping have forget to put the special thick matress protector on the bed .<ssssss>i call housekeeping and be personally guarenteed it would be rectify , when we return to we room in the afternoon , again after be lock out , we discover the bed be still just spring .<ssssss>so by 6pm on we last night in this hotel with no airconditioner and the bed from hell , we be offer another room , upgrade , so , we have to change we dinner plan to pack up we belongings and move room .<ssssss>this hotel have email we with a post stay survey , would you believe , specifially ask we about the dream bed we have stay at other rydge without problem but this hotel be very disappointing .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 3 2 4 3		great location-very expensive parking !<ssssss>my wife and i have stay here many time over the last couple of year and have learn a lot about the hotel .<ssssss>please know that when you stay here it be a bit rustic/authentic old new orlean style which be really cool , but you be pay a lot less than the higher end hotel that be also in the french quarter .<ssssss>we love stay here but recently the staff have change and we notice some difference .<ssssss>first the parking be very expensive .<ssssss>we check in on friday at 7:00 p.m. and check out on sunday at 10:00 a.m. and the cost be $ 28.00 per day plus tax !!!<ssssss>next be careful about what room you be offer to stay in at the chateau lemoyne .<ssssss>room with window face the street that surround the hotel be very noisey , but can also be very beautiful .<ssssss>if you have ear plug or loud stereo booming car all night long do not bother you than this information be not important to you .<ssssss>if you need peace and quite , like I , then you need and interior room .<ssssss>ask for one face the pool or pool view just to make sure .<ssssss>we really enjoy stay here but the parking should be free or $ 10.00 per day for guest of the hotel .<ssssss>there be no reason for overpriced parking for visitor of new orlean .<ssssss>
3 2 2 5 4 4 5 1		great location , small room i stay at the hotel for 4 night during february 2008 .<ssssss>the booking be make through a travel agency in greece , and though i have ask for a double bed front view room , mine be twin and have no view.before book the hotel i have read several review , for small and not clean room .<ssssss>the room be very clean and renovate but a little bit small .<ssssss>.<ssssss>people on the reception desk be very helpful .<ssssss>breakfast be plain , but nice and the staff also polite .<ssssss>we have one lunch there , so as to taste the famous filet , which be to we disappoinment bad and very expensive.a problem that we have be that due to a cancellation of we flight , all the group have to stay one extra night and the new room that we be give be so small , that have no closet and only one person could stand be around the bed at the same time .<ssssss>apart from that , the room have old casing and it be very cold and noisy.generaly the hotel be very noisy .<ssssss>you could hear people ' step from the corridor or from the room upstairs .<ssssss>another thing , be that during check in the reception desk ask for we credit card for guarantee of any extra , which be common and acceptable , but without minus bar in the room -lrb- for a example -rrb- , what consumption can you make ???<ssssss>overall the hotel in a very nice location in central amsterdam , with bus and tram stop just outside and just 5 minute on foot from the central train station , near the market etc. .<ssssss>would visit it again , provide that i would have a larger room .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 3 1 1 -1		not impress with service not impressed .<ssssss>order a one bedroom suite .<ssssss>give I a twin room .<ssssss>what the hell ?<ssssss>i want what i pay for .<ssssss>aparently the room i want ` wasnt available ' or ` didnt exist ' .<ssssss>i dont know , the woman -lrb- assistant magager by the way -rrb- keep go round in circle give I the same infonfor 20 min and she english be below undestandable .<ssssss>in the end i say i have better thing to do and be already late for a appointment so i storm off ; - it didnt help that check in be at 2 , i arrive at 3 and have to wait for my room to be ready .<ssssss>deffinately not impressed .<ssssss>i tell they i wasnt pay for parking in the morning due to they stuff up - they didnt even offer I any consultation !<ssssss>- but as if you would pay for they parking anyway , it be so unbelivably steep and two-way ?<ssssss>pfft can hardly fit my small car in the lane.if i have get what i pay for , and the staff actually know what they be do my experience may have be a whole lot better .<ssssss>.<ssssss>would not stay here again unless you pay I .<ssssss>
3 3 -1 -1 -1 5 -1 -1		ok choice for a stay in paris we stay at the hotel in august for four night .<ssssss>it be a ok option , with clean room , a good breakfast -lrb- for france -rrb- and friendly service .<ssssss>the room be quite small though , just big enough for a double bed and a tiny adjacent bathroom .<ssssss>the hotel 's location be quite convenient , close to metro and rer line and you be quickly everywhere in paris.the service be very good and staff at the reception extremely friendly and helpful.if you get a good deal on the room rate , definitely worth consider .<ssssss>
4 3 3 5 5 5 5 4		nice enough hotel in great location - need update we see this hotel gloriously recommend on many sites/books so mabye we expectation be just elevated , especially compare to other well review hotel we stay at in tuscany and amalfi.while the staff be very very friendly and helpful and room clean and big , the furnishing and room comfort do need to be update .<ssssss>while we appreciate the antique decor , have a antique , thin matress on the bed be not as well received.there be a conspicuous lack of closet hanging and drawer space .<ssssss>the one wardrobe they have be too narrow to accomodate a stardard hanger -lrb- door would not longer close and we could not hang a suit -rrb- .<ssssss>the bathroom be great -lrb- two sink ! -rrb-<ssssss>... but the shower head look like it be from the 80 's , and work well enough to fall into that category.the biggest disspointment for we though be the include breakfast at the hotel .<ssssss>as spectacular as the terrace be , the breakfast quality and choice totally negate that .<ssssss>we eat there we first morning -lrb- stale croissant , cold coffee , limited fruit selection -rrb- , and from then on just down the street to the cavalli cafe which be excellent.in summary they just need to invest a bit on improve the quality of breakfast and the in-room facility .<ssssss>

-rrb-<ssssss>pool : we sit by the pool but never go in .<ssssss>we werenât impressed -lrb- probably because the beach be only a few block away ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>lot of kid and teenager run around .<ssssss>they have a masseuse cabana available for massage poolside which iâm disappointed that i didnât get a chance to try .<ssssss>casino bar : the afternoon that we hang out by the pool , we decide to order food , but be tell we have to re-enter the hotel to order at the casino bar as take out to bring out .<ssssss>the woman who take we order at the bar be very rude , basically ignore we when we first get there .<ssssss>she couldâve write down we order but instead , she forget it and have to yell for we to repeat it once she get to the register .<ssssss>then after wait twenty minute for two sandwich , we find out she put the order in wrong .<ssssss>when she finally get we sandwich , she place it on the counter and didnât tell we that it be ours .<ssssss>ugh .<ssssss>by the time we eat we sandwich which be grilled , they be lukewarm .<ssssss>we be extremely disappointed .<ssssss>she really ruin we afternoon .<ssssss>we end up call the general manager -lrb- the number on the comment card in the room -rrb- and get through and voice we disappointment .<ssssss>i didnât want to do it all trip , but i finally pull the honeymoon card and tell he that i have think that after have my wedding at a fabulous hilton and enjoy fantastic service , i should be able to expect have hilton hospitality on my honeymoon as well .<ssssss>the general manager be very apologetic and state to we that he will consider possibly retrain some of he staff .<ssssss>he ask if there be anything he could comp we on , but we tell he that we just sincerely want to voice we opinion .<ssssss>-lrb- on the last night he send we a bottle of champagne anyway , but say that it be a honeymoon gift . -rrb-<ssssss>iâd like to add though , that it the general manager do make we feel like he care about how we stay be go , which mean a lot to we .<ssssss>so we general conclusion with this embassy suite ?<ssssss>i suppose that for a couple nightsâ?stay -lrb- like a quick long weekend -rrb- it would be ok , but probably not for a special occasion .<ssssss>now that we be recall we memory , itâs not as painful , but during what shouldâve be a great time , it be a bit of a inconvenience .<ssssss>iâd like to add that as a general comment with regard to san juanâs tourist area , for some reason , the hospitality isnât really up to par with other destination .<ssssss>-lrb- which disappoint my puerto rican husband immensely -rrb- unfortunately , at a few of the place that we go to , we get treat worse than we neighborhood applebeeâs .<ssssss>

4 2 4 -1 5 -1 5 -1		very good hotel but the marketing be skewed this be a very good hotel .<ssssss>it be a modern , recently design and build establishment in a excellent , central location .<ssssss>you be within 10 minute ' walk of the louvre and just 15 minute of the opera .<ssssss>from that point of view it could hardly be bettered.the service be second to none and the breakfast be very good .<ssssss>i think breakfast be probably very expensive even by paris standard , so if you want to save money , you should know that within a few minute ' walk of the hotel there be some very pleasant cafe on the rue de rivoli.i book on the internet and upgrade my booking because i want to give my wife a treat .<ssssss>i have to say that i be disappoint on several count :1 .<ssssss>when i arrive the staff appear unaware of the upgrade or what it entail ; 2 .<ssssss>the upgrade be suppose to give I a bottle of champagne on arrival , but it be not to be have until ask for ; 3 .<ssssss>the room be small .<ssssss>i think this be the biggest disappointment .<ssssss>if they offer a upgrade for couple i think that the room ought to be a priority - but it be so small that my wife and i have to negotiate verbally before get out of the bed because there be so little room .<ssssss>the bathroom be almost as big as the bedroom .<ssssss>furthermore , i be not pleased that the first thing they say to I when i check in be that i could upgrade my room for 80 euro .<ssssss>well , if you have already upgrade you booking , why should you have to upgrade again if you want a decent-sized room?so on balance , this be a very good hotel , but they marketing be , i think , annoyingly skewed .<ssssss>either you upgrade , and you upgrade properly , get a decent room , or you do not .<ssssss>it be as simple as that .<ssssss>but to have several layer of upgrade , none of they understand by the staff , seem to I crazy .<ssssss>

3 3 5 5 5 2 2 -1		many pluss , but some problem i actually love this hotel for its spacious room , comfortable bathroom , close proximity to the metro and a grocery -lrb- great for travel with small kid -rrb- and fantastic location on a quiet street .<ssssss>however , continental breakfast -lrb- 2 croissant and a hot drink -rrb- be overprice at 9 euro -lrb- no discount for even little kid -rrb- , and the elevator be out of order on 4 of the 6 day of we stay .<ssssss>when i suggest that there should be some accommodation for not have a elevator -lrb- as it be a essential part of my requirement when book a room with small kid -rrb- , i be tell on the second -lrb- or third -rrb- day of we stay that they would find I another hotel , but that be all -lrb- i.e. , take it or leave it -rrb- .<ssssss>as i be travel with two small child -lrb- age 2 4 -rrb- , have already unpacked and have get acclimate , i do not consider this a realistic option , especially for a 6-day stay .<ssssss>when i ask for a late check-out on we final day -lrb- 2:30 pm , as oppose to noon -rrb- , as a small concession , i be flatly and very curtly refuse .<ssssss>otherwise the service be very helpful .<ssssss>finally , the cleaning staff be very , very good , but very , very noisy , talk loudly among themselves down the hall and up and down the stair in the morning .<ssssss>no problem if you be a early riser .<ssssss>in sum , many pluss , but i be not sure it be worth the price .<ssssss>
2 3 3 4 4 3 3 1		nice place terrible restaurant the lazy parrot be a nice unpretentious place with a ridiculously pretentious restaurant .<ssssss>the price be way above those of western puerto rico in general -lrb- you would do way better at the tamboo tavern , sandy beach surf club or the spot -rrb- and the waiter demand 20 % which be much more than the average tip policy in wpr -lrb- geneally between 12-15 % -rrb- .<ssssss>my advice : stay there , eat elsewhere !<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 2 1 1 3		unfriendly staff i have stay at the vibe hotel goulburn street about 6 time for business over the past 12-18 month primarily due to it be location and the modern decor which make a pleasant change from you average hotel decor .<ssssss>however , the staff have never be remotely friendly or helpful.staff be extremely rude and unhelpful to the point of be unco-operative when i request a ` smoking room ' -lrb- yes it be tragic -rrb- .<ssssss>i be tell none be available but that i have be upgrade to a executive room to which i indicate no that be what i have book and pay for .<ssssss>i be then give a standard room on the third which turn out to be a non-smoking floor and it be not until i ask they to arrange for I to be transfer to another hotel that a room suddenly become available.this time i also notice the cleaning standard have slip - the shower screen , bath and tile have scum mark all over they and the mirror be dirty.great modern decor , spacious room but a shame about the way it be run .<ssssss>
5 3 5 2 5 4 5 3		great city we stay in the millenium hilton from the 29th of december through to the 8th of january .<ssssss>firstly , the connection to everthing here be excellent , we take the subway to and from the airport , it only take 45 min not sure how long a cab take but it be around $ 45 , the subway be 2 .<ssssss>the subway be also excellent for get uptown with the ` e ' drop you right next to macy in 34th or time square at 42nd or right up to the rockerfeller on 53rd all for 2 buck , if you make a couple of trip a day as we do it save alot of money on 15 - 20 buck cabs.the hotel be excellent we never have to wait long to check in and as i have request on the hilton website when book i get a high floor room on the 49th floor .<ssssss>we room over look ground zero out to new jersey , the view be excellent , we find that the noise be no problem unless you open the window , though the air conditioning unit be noisy at night .<ssssss>the pool and sauna be nice though the buisness suite with the internet for hire be expensive , try to find a internet cafe .<ssssss>the only complaint i have be not to do with the hotel as such but the location i find to be a bit of a hassle , though the subway be right outside , if you be shop up 5th avenue or in around time squre it be a bit of a trek to come back to the hotel for a change of clothes or to drop off bag etc , it be also harder to find pub and resteraunt within walk distance.overall though i would definatly recommend the hotel .<ssssss>
4 5 5 2 5 3 5 4		make sure to check out the spa very nice and clean hotel .<ssssss>most desk staff speak a little english , but double check important detail .<ssssss>breakfast buffet be very nice .<ssssss>the huge spa be something not to be miss .<ssssss>price be most reasonable .<ssssss>i prefer the 9th floor spa to the service offer in the pool area -lrb- better ambience , though the pool area be cheaper -rrb- .<ssssss>in restaurant , order you meat more cook than you like it .<ssssss>ours tend to keep come we rarer than we would prefer.it be in the ourskirt of town , so not necesarily convenient , but great value for the money , and taxi be cheap -lrb- make sure you only get in metered taxis ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>have fun !<ssssss>

bump , brake and bouncing.since we arrive at the resort around noon we room be not ready yet .<ssssss>we have lunch and check on the location of we room .<ssssss>we prefer a pool view and the first room do not have that .<ssssss>it have a view of the garden and the building next door .<ssssss>we go back to the front desk to inquire about possibly change we room to a pool view and be tell no

.<ssssss>the middle pool bar and towel guy be right across the bridge from we room.i have to agree that the room be small and very average look .<ssssss>we reserve a deluxe room type .<ssssss>the maid do a great job cleaning and keep we towel stock .<ssssss>you do have to be very careful about bring any food or drink into you room .<ssssss>the little tiny sugar ant be everywhere there be a tiny piece of food or a open drink .<ssssss>air conditioner work great .<ssssss>i think that we have just get use to junior suite and that be why the room seem small .<ssssss>one funny thing be that the

of.restaurants : we have breakfast at the buffet daily .<ssssss>very good selection .<ssssss>i do not know if bacon be in short supply but some day there would be plenty , other day none , some day just a empty serve dish for a hour .<ssssss>i know it be just bacon , but my husband love bacon .<ssssss>the food be good but never hot .<ssssss>it be warm , but not hot .<ssssss>we find this to be true at all the restaurant .<ssssss>the mexican restaurant be just ok .<ssssss>the seaside grill have good steak but be lack on side dish .<ssssss>we miss not have baked potato with we steak -lrb- they do serve fries -rrb- .<ssssss>oceana have good seafood but very small portion .<ssssss>the dinner buffet be very good .<ssssss>the roast beef be excellent and the fish dish be very good too .<ssssss>the dessert be wonderful .<ssssss>very good variety and cut into small portion so you can try more than one.we do eat at the bordeaux and it be we favorite .<ssssss>very , very good meal , wine and dessert.the beach be beautiful .<ssssss>the nice part about stay at dream be that it be off by itself and you can walk for long distance on the beach and not see another resort or person for that matter .<ssssss>again , alot of palapa for shade .<ssssss>the beach bed be great .<ssssss>there be a few in the preferred section and about 6 of for anyone to use .<ssssss>a word to the wise ... just because they be cover do not mean you be out of the sun ray .<ssssss>the sun do come thru and you will get a sunburn if you do not have sunblock on .<ssssss>there be a small market for souvenir about a 10 minute walk from the resort .<ssssss>just go out of the lobby and turn right .<ssssss>there be maybe 10 shop at this center .<ssssss>we also go to hard rock punta cana .<ssssss>the taxi be

people -lrb- guest and staff -rrb- .<ssssss>i would have to say that i do not think that it should have apple 's highest rating but i do think that it be a fine resort for budget mind family that be not picky about every little thing .<ssssss>i think sometimes people read the word luxury and get all kind of idea .<ssssss>this be a fine , moderate resort .<ssssss>
2 2 2 3 2 4 4 -1		the bilt-mold resort and spa ... .<ssssss>bleh !<ssssss>... for what we pay -lrb- and there be 7 of we -rrb- not a experience worth repeat .<ssssss>we all have multiple mystery charge on we bill .<ssssss>leave a message for they accounting dept to get back to I on that one .<ssssss>this hotel be book for we to attend a conference and we be scatter in different building with vary level of upkeep -lrb- some ok ... other molding ... or in my case slightly roach infested -rrb- .<ssssss>the ac do not work well but that be a minor detail.room service be very prompt ... and they should be give what they charge you for order anything.housekeeping in my experience be good but i know one co-worker have one day where they do not show up.i would not recommend or stay at this hotel again .<ssssss>in my opinion its very pricey for what it actually provide and certainly not worth it .<ssssss>
5 5 3 2 3 5 5 5		gorgous hotel have a lovely time at the elysee - the location be great for 5th avenue shopping , and the staff be extremely friendly and helpful .<ssssss>cute little bar downstairs be nice for cocktail , but the highlight of we stay be the lovely lounge area overlook the street , where free drink and snack be serve in the evening .<ssssss>they also have a fantastic breakfast here , which be include in the price of the room , a big plus on a holiday in america where they usually charge extra for everything !<ssssss>~ the only snag be that the room be very small , and not particularly spectacular inside - but easily forgive when relax in the lovely drawing room , ideal for chat , reading , and chill out .<ssssss>would recommend this hotel for woman traveler , for kid , teens , and would especially recommend for older traveller or couple as it be very cosy and handy for mid town .<ssssss>
3 2 3 -1 3 -1 5 -1		friendly staff but do not live up to renaissance brand of hotel i stay at the ilikai for a business trip.positives : - location be very good to get to most of the business locate in town - close to the ala moana mall across the street - most room have some view of the water without pay extra money - balcony be a nice touch , but probably do not work well for most room -lrb- see below -rrb- - down comforter - lot of kid -lrb- good for family , not couple -rrb- - very friendly staffnegative : - decor look totally outdated , need a major facelift !<ssssss>you may be frighten when you first arrive because it look more like a apartment building than a major hotel chain .<ssssss>do not believe the deceive picture on the hotel website !!!<ssssss>that be where i go wrong .<ssssss>- the balcony on most room in the main hotel look into other hotel room - so if you expect to sit in you balcony without have someone possibly stare you down ... no luck here .<ssssss>- not very good for office travel as there be no wireless internet - you only have direct access to the ethernet line which be a pain if you want to check email in the lobby , or near the pool .<ssssss>- pool be crowd and small - food be mediocre - but okay because there be a ton of awesome place nearby - gym look like it be in a scary basementoverall assessment : if you be a business traveler , there be better option -lrb- hawaiian prince hotel next door be excellent -rrb- .<ssssss>for the vacationer , i would say you would be happier stay somewhere else further down in waikiki which will be more central to the beautiful ocean and nightlife .<ssssss>this hotel be expensive and certainly do not invoke the luxury vacation feel .<ssssss>unfortunately , i believe the ilikai be stick in a 80s time warp where teassed hair and garbage pail kid be in .<ssssss>

4 5 3 5 4 4 3 3		great value , no frill but no surprise either this be a fantastic value for the money !<ssssss>i hesitate before try it because of the negative review , but in my experience a 3.5 average tripadvisor work for I , so i go for it .<ssssss>the only way one could be disappoint with this place be by have unrealistic expectations.i make my reservation directly through the hotel website , choose the $ 52 european queen/single adult , which turn out to be room 711 face the water .<ssssss>i check in on saturday afternoon , after 2:30 .<ssssss>the room itself , the sink and the linen be all perfectly clean in appearance , feel , and smell .<ssssss>the tap water taste fine , although i let it run for a while before fill my glass since it be a old building .<ssssss>the decor be not worth mention but just to be complete here it be ; hodgepodge cheap motel style , which by definition be unattractive , but it be not remarkably ugly .<ssssss>there be 3 set of towel , 4 cup and 4 bar of soap .<ssssss>there be no clock , but you can ask for a wakeup call , or use the tv to keep track of time -lrb- reception be not great on all channel , but the news weather be fine -rrb- .<ssssss>the toilet across the hall be a little concrete cell , but it be clean .<ssssss>the full bathroom right around the corner be roomy , clean , and dry .<ssssss>i do not use the sink because i have one in my room , but i have no problem get plenty of hot water for my shower .<ssssss>the water pressure could have be stronger , but it be adequate .<ssssss>i never have to wait for the toilet or the shower , nor do i have people wait after I to use them.there be some rowdy neighbor late saturday night , which i expect , but i be a easy sleeper so it do not bother I .<ssssss>there be some street/city noise from outside , but nothing extraordinary if you have ever live in a urban setting .<ssssss>my time in the room be spend either get ready to go out or to sleep ... i be not around to experience noise from the theater downstairs , so i can not comment on that.the homeless be very direct in downtown seattle , but they be also quite professional so it be not that big a deal .<ssssss>my impression be that they be just exercise they right to ask I for money and in turn , they respect my right to say no.i really enjoy my stay because it be no fuss , no frill , and no ugly surprise , so i could concentrate on other thing .<ssssss>even though it be inexpensive , i never feel , oh no , i should have splurge on better accommodation !<ssssss>which have definitely happen to I before .<ssssss>i be go to stay at the moore again on my next seattle trip .<ssssss>

1 1 2 5 2 1 1 3		really , really overrate after read review on tripadvisor , in magazine , boston 's best of ... about the charlesmark , i decide to book it .<ssssss>i think this place and its staff have let the review go to they collective head .<ssssss>for pay $ 198 per night , i expect a lot more in term of customer service .<ssssss>when i walk in , there be three people behind the 2.5 foot long front desk .<ssssss>two continue they personal conversation and the third person look at I with no interest whatsoever .<ssssss>there be no how may i help you ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>no good afternoon .<ssssss>no nada .<ssssss>when i ask for help with we bag , one young man follow I out to the car and watch as i unloaded the bag .<ssssss>it take over one-half hour for we bag to make it to we room .<ssssss>although there be a apology offeredfor it take so long , it be give while the offeror be on he cellphone in the midst of a personal conversation .<ssssss>this be not a good sign .<ssssss>none of the three staff we have regular contact with would engage in a conversation without be prompt , no good morning , etc. the carpet do not appear to have be vaccume either in the hall or we room in several day .<ssssss>again , not for essentially $ 200 a night .<ssssss>there be some positive : the interior design be great , there be one bartender name jefferson who i would recommend to anyone , the location be perfect -lrb- however , any downtown hotel be strategically located for business/tourist travel -rrb- , the disorganization and generalinattention to detail get we a couple glass of pinot noir and appetizer for free .<ssssss>that be not the intention , however .<ssssss>when i check out , i be tell that everything be take care of .<ssssss>i remindedthe person at the desk that we have two night of a bar tab charge toour room .<ssssss>she look at I , say , well , that be a separate system andhe -lrb- not sure who -rrb- be not here right now .<ssssss>twenty minute later one ofthe staff say , you charge be $ 10 but i be have a hard time print it .<ssssss>in the next ten minute , he walk by I four time anddid not address I .<ssssss>while we be double park and load we car ourselves , i run back in and ask that the bill be mail to I .<ssssss>btw , we bill should have be about $ 50 so i be apparently as confused as they be .<ssssss>we will be back in boston in september and will not be stay here !<ssssss>

3 3 4 5 3 4 2 1		room for improvement we stay at the grand oasis from 6th - 12th june 2008 , and i can say that it be a mixed experience .<ssssss>we arrive to be greet with a nice cold fruit punch and a fast check in service .<ssssss>we immediately upgrade to block 7 -lrb- room 7220 -rrb- for we $ 50 per night , as we have read the review on this site before leave .<ssssss>not have see any other room i can not comment on they , but we be really happy with the room we receive , except for the small sand ant that seem to congregate around the coffee pot .<ssssss>we report this to reception and they offer to fumigate we room but could not offer we alternative accommodation !<ssssss>we decline as we do not want to die of toxic poisoning , and live with the ant .<ssssss>however to be fair we be not over-run , and avoid the coffee pot work a treat .<ssssss>the view be amazing and we overlook the beach , with a lovely balcony and inside and outside jacuzzi .<ssssss>the restaurant be hit and miss , the american grill be the worst , we wait over 20 minute to be serve , and eventually leave after be ignore by several waiter .<ssssss>i also ask for wine to be tell no wine and then have the table either side of we -lrb- both with spanish speak guest -rrb- serve white .<ssssss>i be prepared to be generous and say that it be perhaps a language barrier , but i discover later on that be a english speaker make you a second class citizen as some waiter would serve spanish speak guest first , and they have a habit of queue jump .<ssssss>however the remainder of the staff be really helpful and courteous - i guess it just depend who you get on a particular day .<ssssss>the italian restaurant in comparison be fantastic , the food , service and wine -lrb- yep get some eventually -rrb- be wonderful , and i can only praise the d'mario .<ssssss>the resort should look to d'mario as they benchmark , and the service would improve 10 fold.the only other restaurant we try be window with a buffet style theme .<ssssss>i have read a few review that state the food there be cold , and while i agree that it could have be hotter , it be a buffet and there be always fresh fruit , vegetable and salad on offer .<ssssss>we eat more in there than other restaurant as we always find something we like and enjoy the flexibility of not have to book a specific time slot to eat .<ssssss>the pool be clean and the bar be always very very generous with they measure .<ssssss>but you must be aware that there be a tipping culture .<ssssss>we tip the cleaner $ 5 per day -lrb- more than normal , but i know how messy my boyfriend be -rrb- , and hope for a more special service .<ssssss>we receive the minimum , no extra coke or beer and the number of towel we receive depend on the day .<ssssss>but the room be always spotless and this to I be more important .<ssssss>yes there be seaweed on the beach but there be staff cleaning every day , and it really be not too bad .<ssssss>finally the one and only thing that i feel really let the resort down , be the seller .<ssssss>we be badger all the time , and although we do buy a few item in the end we feel continuously pressured .<ssssss>one of the shop keeper try rip we off by try to charge we 85 peso to 1 we $ , instead of the ex .<ssssss>rate of 33 - 35 .<ssssss>we argue , and tell he take 35 or leave it and he change he tune .<ssssss>i suppose that you get people everywhere try it on , but it do leave a bitter taste in my mouth .<ssssss>to be fair though i do not know how much influence the hotel have over the sellers.to summarise if you speak spanish or french and do not mind tip a buck or two for everything then you will have a great time .<ssssss>otherwise it might be a bit hit or miss .<ssssss>

2 1 2 -1 4 -1 1 -1		disappointed .<ssssss>not recommend .<ssssss>stay at the paradisus punta cana jan. 16-23 , 2006 .<ssssss>pay $ 375 per night for 2 adult , all-inclusive .<ssssss>book via the hotel 's website and purchase we airline ticket directly from aa.paradisus be 25-30 minute from the airport -lrb- puj -rrb- .<ssssss>a taxi will cost $ 25 one-way .<ssssss>we dollar be accept everywhere in the dominican republic , no need to exchange currency.the good ... the paradisus be beautifully landscape with lush , tropical grounds , very clean and well manicure .<ssssss>the lobby area be incredible , open-air and very tropical .<ssssss>many of the restaurant be also open-air and very well decorated.the swimming pool be one of the largest pool we have ever see and the beach be beautiful -- great for long walk .<ssssss>we room be very nice , clean , and recently re-model .<ssssss>we do not pay for the optional royal service and do not recommend it.the bad ... service .<ssssss>we have travel to over 25 differnet island in the caribbean and have be to every country in central america .<ssssss>this be the most unfriendly , unskilled , unprofessional staff we have ever see .<ssssss>i would guess its more a cultural difference than a training issue .<ssssss>they just do not care , have no motivation , and no supervision to ensure that even the simplest task be complete .<ssssss>the poor level of service be consistant from the front dest check-in to the restaurant to the housekeeping staff .<ssssss>bed .<ssssss>the room be nicely decorate and furnish , but the bed be hard as a rock .<ssssss>other friend we be travel with have the same experience in they room .<ssssss>and the pillow -- they only have one type : flat and old !<ssssss>not what you would expect from a 4 star , let alone a 5 star property.food .<ssssss>most disappointing .<ssssss>the buffet be quite large and extensive , but the quality be just not there .<ssssss>the food be not hot enough .<ssssss>as for the restaurant , we eat at 8 out of the 10 choice .<ssssss>we like the italian and brazilan restaurant , but again , the service be terrible .<ssssss>each restaurant offer a wine list , but each night they be out of many choice .<ssssss>on we last night they only have 1 choice of red .<ssssss>we opt for beer instead .<ssssss>we have stay ot other sol melia property and would rate this one at the bottom .<ssssss>even sol melia 's 3 star resort have better food than this place.misc ... other thing to be aware of .<ssssss>the ocean be very cold .<ssssss>perhaps 10 degree colder than the bvi 's or western caribbean .<ssssss>there be never a problem find a chair or palapa on the beach , but the pool chair disappear very early in the morning .<ssssss>we like to walk and enjoy walk the grounds , but you should be aware that it be a 15-20 minute walk each direction from the lobby to some room or the restaurant / beach area .<ssssss>also , the service vehicle , van , tram , and scooter use the walkway and will not give way to guest .<ssssss>watch out and step aside when they pass .<ssssss>overall , we be disappointed and will not be go back .<ssssss>
1 1 2 2 4 1 1 2		do not book this hotel i stay at this hotel in the spring .<ssssss>the hotel do not meet expectation , and when i try to leave early , management be rude to my family .<ssssss>hotel would not honor its cancellation policy .<ssssss>worst hotel experience in 30 year of travel .<ssssss>
1 1 1 5 4 3 3 -1		noisy and no service we be give a free upgrade to a junior suite as standard room be not big enough to fit two bed yet , they give a rate for all the family staying in one room.the two child sleep on a sofa-bed that be hideously uncomfortable .<ssssss>we bed be superb and the bathroom be good.all the suite back onto a night club that pound out music until 4am .<ssssss>so , if you want a room big enough a family to fit in , you will be keep awake until the small hour by the adjacent flavour nightclub.if you want breakfast in the restaurant you have to book a table or wait in line for up to one hour -lrb- on a sunday when we try -rrb- as the restaurant seat less than a tenth of the capacity of the hotel .<ssssss>yet , if you want you complimentary breakfast in you room then you pay in full for it.this be a expensive hotel that look great and have a nice pool , but the service be terrible and the noisy location let it down .<ssssss>
4 4 4 4 5 3 4 1		old , but decent i stay at the queen kap for my weeklong vacation in oahu .<ssssss>my first impression be that it be old and could have use new carpet and a paint job - especially in the hallway , but we room be clean and large enough for 3 people .<ssssss>the ac -lrb- very important in hawaii ! -rrb-<ssssss>work well and the maid do a great job of clean we room each day .<ssssss>there be a mini fridge , but no microwave , which would have be useful .<ssssss>there be also no computer access .<ssssss>the bathroom look recently renovate though .<ssssss>i would definitely recommend book a room with a view .<ssssss>we 's look out to the hostel next door so we have to keep we curtain draw most of the time .<ssssss>the best thing about the queen be its location .<ssssss>it be close to the beach and the main strip , which make shopping and find food easy , but since it be not on the main street it be much quieter and feel safer as well .<ssssss>the staff be competent , but be not very friendly .<ssssss>however , we have we lonely planet and fodor travel book so we really do not need they help .<ssssss>while the hotel offer parking for a fee , there be a street nearby that have free parking and be about 5 min walk distance to the hotel .<ssssss>the queen kap be a good find and be definitely worth the price .<ssssss>
2 3 2 5 3 4 4 2		only consider if under $ 120/night .<ssssss>while the location be great and the staff friendly and helpful , the room be all y and no boutique .<ssssss>a permanent -lrb- i assume -rrb- resident next door have a home stereo that send boom bass and techno pulse through the wall begin at 7:20 am .<ssssss>the room have a linoleum tiled floor , basic oak dorm-like furniture and the shower be too tiny to work very well .<ssssss>if you get a super low rate -lrb- under $ 120 , maybe -rrb- , this location may be enough enticement .<ssssss>otherwise , i would skip it .<ssssss>

3 2 4 4 4 4 4 1		pretty good - but pool turn into club scene at night i just return from a 10 day stay at the roosevelt .<ssssss>i would hear good review from friend but be a little disappointed .<ssssss>i stay in a regular room with 2 bed overlook the roof -lrb- have a lovely view of the air conditioner -rrb- .<ssssss>pro : bed be very nice -- soft white down comforter and pillows.front desk and valet staff be very friendly and helpful.location be great .<ssssss>restaurant , food and walk of fame etc very close .<ssssss>there be a long a block away where you can buy anything you could ever possibly need.cons : there be a coffee machine in the room but you have to pay 3.50 for the coffee in the mini bar .<ssssss>i have travel all over the world and do not recall ever see that before , be it just I or be that a little ridiculous?closet be dark due to the dark paint and lack of lighting .<ssssss>water leak out the side of the shower so you be guarantee a pool of water under the sink after every shower.overall it be a good experience but there be one thing i do want to mention .<ssssss>the pool turn into a club at night and can be a rather nice place to hang out - if you can get past the bouncer .<ssssss>i have no trouble get in but some of my co-worker do .<ssssss>despite be guest they be tell they need to be with girl and on another occasion they be tell they need to go change they clothes .<ssssss>be a hotel guest do not guarantee entry or that they will treat you with respect .<ssssss>so , if you be not in the mood for a club scene , as soon as they put up the velvet rope avoid the pool .<ssssss>

3 3 5 -1 2 -1 1 -1		mixed feeling my husband and i just get back from san francisco .<ssssss>we stay here for 2 night .<ssssss>i have a high expectation of the hotel since my family and i have stay many many time at pan pacific around the world and have always experience a first class service .<ssssss>goods : - we be assign a room for disable , therefore , there be only a shower and no tub as promise .<ssssss>we ask to be reassign and the nice man who check we in previously be able to reassign we another room with a tub .<ssssss>he be very friendly and accomodate .<ssssss>- the room be nice .<ssssss>.<ssssss>very spacious .<ssssss>like the design .<ssssss>- the bed be comfortable .<ssssss>lot of extra fluffy pillow .<ssssss>- a perfect location .<ssssss>one block from union square .<ssssss>close enough to walk to the shopping area , but not smack in the middle of the crowd .<ssssss>- love the big bathroom .<ssssss>a small tv in the bathroom be a nice touch .<ssssss>love take a bath and watch my favorite sitcom at the same time .<ssssss>the bad : - the doorman be unfriendly .<ssssss>not even once they ever say hello or smile at we when we walk by .<ssssss>in fact , one time my husband say hello and be ignore even though he clearly be look at we .<ssssss>- another bad experience with the unfriendly doorman .<ssssss>we be tell the hotel provide a car service .<ssssss>we ask a doorman if the car would take we to japantown .<ssssss>he start laugh and condesendingly say , that be 15 block from here .<ssssss>a simple no would do .<ssssss>- during check in , the nice man i mention above mention i should take advantage of the butler draw bath for guest .<ssssss>it sound nice , so i think , why not .<ssssss>so , when we get to the room , we request the buttler to draw I a bath .<ssssss>first of all , the butler lady be so puzzle when we request it -lrb- i check , it be list as one of the service they provide guest -rrb- .<ssssss>when she come to we room , she ask I if i would do it myself .<ssssss>she give I a bowl of bath salt and leave .<ssssss>i do not mind do that myself , but you can not advertise you service and not deliver .<ssssss>at the end , i could only rate this hotel 3 out of 5 .<ssssss>maybe what they employee need be a class on customer service .<ssssss>
2 3 2 2 4 5 4 1		extremely disappointing we stay at the farjardo inn for 5 night begin 4/15 .<ssssss>first the o.k. stuff : the hotel have some pluss : landscaping , 2 nice pool , and if youâre lucky a good enough room with a good enough view .<ssssss>-lrb- iâll explain more later -- but in the meantime donât stay in rm .<ssssss># 208 . -rrb-<ssssss>most of the staff be friendly , polite and responsive about request .<ssssss>the food be o.k. in the starfish restaurant .<ssssss>as a whole we find the puerto rican people to be very nice.now the unfortunate minus .<ssssss>for the life of we we can not understand why there have be no mention that this hotel , while very nice from the look of it despite itâs hilly terrain , hammer and saw noise from a construction project on the property , inconsistency with pool and restaurant hour , internet use and access problem , hotel amenity not available , a lack of knowledge about reputable and decent resource available to visit the sight , stray dog and cat in the most pathetic condition about the premise -- it have not be mention that the location of this hotel be among impoverished and dilapidated neighborhood and from the look of what serve as âhomesâ?with jail bar or cage around they , some serious crime issue .<ssssss>although we do not encounter any conflict in the day during we travels , we guess that it might have be a different issue at night .<ssssss>the town be dirty with many boarded-up store front and many indigent people idle about the street or in bar .<ssssss>the kiosk be disgust .<ssssss>we canât believe why anyone would take a chance at these place .<ssssss>when we ask for a restaurant recommendation , we be tell to try rosaâs seafood .<ssssss>as with most everywhere else we drive to , you have to drive through some of the worst poverty stricken neighborhood we have ever see .<ssssss>with this place , though , the restaurant be right in the slum with a strip down car across the street as a add visual treat .<ssssss>how can you enjoy yourself and supposedly enjoy eat a good meal , when you see all the poverty surround you ?<ssssss>people and animal live in the same squalid condition just outside as you be stuff yourself.are the people at the hotel oblivious or do everyone just accept the terrible condition of they neighbor ?<ssssss>there seem to be no humane service for man or beast .<ssssss>before enter a carvel on rt. 3 , we have to be buzz in .<ssssss>the same for a radio shak store .<ssssss>no doubt other .<ssssss>in the parking lot of strip mall , there often be a guard in a elevated tower .<ssssss>if you go to seven sea beach , one side of the road be a beach and the other side a slum again .<ssssss>this be typical of the whole area .<ssssss>if you have to stay in this section of puerto rico for some reason , the fajardo inn will do , but we find it difficult to enjoy what beauty there be when you have see the poverty that be between you and some of the beautiful view .<ssssss>

3 3 2 5 4 5 5 4		excellent service and great location we stay for 16 night and find the location to be excellent for all the tourist site , especially in the hollywood / beverly hill area , be only a short walk from the chinese theatre and kodak theatre on hollywood boulevardwe be very impressed with the staff who be friendly and very helpful , the service from the staff be without fault , the best we have experience in a long time.the pool be clean and well maintain and heat , very nice indeed .<ssssss>the magic castle club adjoining the hotel give membership to hotel guest but bear in mind if you have child you will only be allow to take they in for sunday brunch , all other time be adult only .<ssssss>have say that the brunch be excellent and great magic show to accompany it .<ssssss>there be a strict dress code but relax a little for the brunch.so why only the average rating ?<ssssss>safe parking in underground car park but $ 10 per day and we be charge for all 16 night although we only park in the garage on 13 of the 16 day be away in san diego and las vegas for a few days.our big dissapointment be we room , room 108 which be a suite but in a bad position be on the gorund floor the view from the window be a derelict fall down fence at the back of the hotel .<ssssss>the suite be also in bad need of decoration and refurbishment , no handle on the wardrobe door , loose electrical socket , the fridge be not work although be quickly replace .<ssssss>the bathroom be the worst be in a very poor state of repair , although clean .<ssssss>the plumbing system be very noisy so if anyone in a adjoining room decide to have a shower in the early hour you could not fail to wake up.we do not see inside any other room , but would recommend you ask for a pool view room.there be no bar or restaurant , except in the adjoining club but a adequate continental style breakfast be servve in the lobby , you can sit around the pool or take it to you room , although we find it hard to get a table by the pool as there be only a small number and in great demand.i would certainly recommend this hotel on the grounds of service and location alone , but bear in mind you room may be quite the same as the photo on the website !<ssssss>andrew parkersuffolkenglanduk<ssssss>

5 5 5 5 4 4 -1 2		efficiently excellent this be a far more pleasant place to stay than the nearby , very expensive ritz carlton , at one-third the price , where we stay several day before sampling the club quarter on we return trip .<ssssss>true , you do not have tje r-c 's snotty help condescend to extend faux cheery good morning , but you have more comfortable room at one-third the price .<ssssss>instead of a sterile , incredibly expensive dine room -lrb- $ 65 for a mediocre breakfast for two -rrb- , you get a reasonably price meal in a cheery adjacent pub .<ssssss>the exercise room be not as fancy , but it be free , as oppose to the r-c 's $ 25 , and you optionally can have a stationary bicycle or elliptical machine deliver to you room , for free of course .<ssssss>if you enjoy in-room coffee , forget the r-c , which do not have it , and go to the club quarter , which have a unlimited supply .<ssssss>true , the r-c have fast 801.2 g wifus , while the club quarter have -lrb- rather inexcusably -rrb- only the slow -lrb- 11 mb -rrb- 801.2 b wifus , but the r-c charge $ 10 a day , while the club quarter provide it for free .<ssssss>anyway , the r-c 's nominal fast internet frequently slow to level slower than dialup -lrb- 10-15 kp -rrb- , so it do not matter.the club quarter be not perfect , of course .<ssssss>something be wrong with the tv system -lrb- which be the exact same as at the r-c -rrb- , so that it be hard to find service other than the standard tv station .<ssssss>it say it offer hd tv , but i could not find it .<ssssss>.<ssssss>however , the club quarter offer two wide-screen plasma tv 's while the r-c have one , standard tv .<ssssss>while the club quater tv have extensive input for pc 's , they appear to have be disabled .<ssssss>-lrb- the ritz carlton have no such input -rrb- .<ssssss>exterior light bathe the window , so the curtain must be draw at night .<ssssss>the air conditioning be quite noisy.but , even without the associate major savings , the club quarter be the superior hotel .<ssssss>

4 4 4 2 4 3 2 2		good hotel , could have free wireless !<ssssss>get to the westin be easy - take a cab , or take the silver line bus from logan airport -lrb- $ 2 , pay in exact bill to the driver or get a ticket in the arrival hall before go to the bus stop -rrb- to the world trade centre .<ssssss>there , follow the sign to the westin â?the walk be about 5 min across a walkway , and itâs worth it , as you get a great skyline view of boston .<ssssss>the world trade centre be the first stop from logan , and take about 3-4 minute to get to .<ssssss>itâs much better value than a cab , and silver line bus be very frequent .<ssssss>with a hotel of this class and price though , iâd have expect a shuttle bus to the airport.the westin be a very well-appointed hotel , and i really enjoy stay there .<ssssss>check-in be fast and painless , and staff be friendly .<ssssss>the room be clean and of a good size , and the bathroom be great â?the best part be the double power-shower , which be wonderful in the morning .<ssssss>the room come with a tv -lrb- annoyingly , the default setting be to go to pay-per-view -rrb- , and a coffee machine .<ssssss>a good touch be the starbuck coffee in the room â?a choice of african roast or mixed blend .<ssssss>have a decaf option would also have be welcome .<ssssss>the room service be , as note by other reviewer here , generally ok but sporadic .<ssssss>i stay six night and some day the coffee wasnât replace ; some day the shampoo be not replace ; â nd a rubber thing which be lie on the ground when i get to this westin be not hover up during my stay there .<ssssss>i think this probably have to do with low staff number rather than staff quality - throughout my stay i be surprise by how few service staff there be on the floor .<ssssss>hotel already pay service staff very little - they could employ a few more and get standard up.fast internet be available in the room .<ssssss>this be $ 9.95 for a 24-hr period , or around $ 5 for 30 minute .<ssssss>go figure .<ssssss>there be free wireless access in the lobby , although staff tell I âit might not workâ ?<ssssss>again , for a hotel this price , provide free wireless would be a good thing.the hotel have 2 bar , both in the lobby .<ssssss>the main bar be in the sauciety eatery .<ssssss>the food be expensive -lrb- $ 10 for a tasty but simple salad -rrb- , as be the drink -lrb- $ 5-6 .50 for a beer , $ 14 and above for a cocktail if i remember correctly -rrb- , but the barman be very good and friendly and the atmosphere chill out .<ssssss>there be a starbuck in the lobby , and the cake there be fairly inexpensive -lrb- $ 2.26 on average -rrb- , but the coffee be go towards $ 4 .<ssssss>there be some restaurant on d street near the hotel , but i didnât try these .<ssssss>i be recommend a restaurant call salvatoreâs on the street , a few minutesâ?walk from the hotel.getting into boston be easy , but take a little bit of time .<ssssss>you can either take a cab , or the silver line from the world trade centre , or , as i do , walk 5-10 minute to south station and take the t or the commuter rail from there .<ssssss>the walk be scenic -lrb- skyline view -rrb- but may be cold in the winter .<ssssss>again , this be where a hotel shuttle bus would be very useful !<ssssss>if you have time , you can walk straight into the financial district in about 20-25 minute from the hotel.the swimming pool be ok , very chlorinated and to a good size .<ssssss>the fitness room be also good .<ssssss>a good touch be the change room with locker and stack of available towel .<ssssss>if you have child , the swimming pool have no lifeguard , so it be not a place to let they swim on they own .<ssssss>
4 2 5 4 4 3 4 2		too big , go only for royal service category if you do not stay in the royal service category , you will not get good service/attention .<ssssss>also must upgrade to the master suite-royal service if you want the luxury of order room service .<ssssss>check in be much faster in r than regular check-in .<ssssss>you bag be bring right along with you to you room .<ssssss>regular check in can take 1-2 hour .<ssssss>you bag can arrive to you room 1-2 hour after that .<ssssss>in the r section , you can wait along the sidewalk for a golf cart to pick you up and bring you around the resort .<ssssss>it be so big , you can not walk to too many thing yourself .<ssssss>there be a train/shuttle that continually circle the resort for those that want to go to the beach or back to the front lobby -lrb- and other stop along the way -rrb- .<ssssss>r side have it be own gabi club and pool .<ssssss>only for r member .<ssssss>the food and service there be great .<ssssss>in the r section you be assign a butler .<ssssss>this person be suppose to come and transport you anywhere you want to go on the resort .<ssssss>call he 3 time - only come once - when we actually check out of the room .<ssssss>la pagoda -lrb- thai restaurant -rrb- be o.k. -lrb- at best -rrb- .<ssssss>el guardo rest .<ssssss>food be better than the thai .<ssssss>make reservation at any of the restaurant -lrb- if you be not a r member -rrb- be tough/if at all possible .<ssssss>as usual with the caribbean , there be no urgency or rush to assist you in get something do .<ssssss>it be extremely humid there all the time .<ssssss>never a good hair day !<ssssss>shuttle from the airport to the hotel be very slow .<ssssss>take a taxi for $ 30 to the resort .<ssssss>you will get to the resort much faster .<ssssss>beautiful resort - too big though .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 3 2 3		ok , but i expect more for a `` five star hotel '' i have be to singapore now a couple of time and try out five different hotel so far , not only for bargain reason , but also to be able to compare thing .<ssssss>location : the pan pacific be perfectly located to go on a extended shopping trip as suntech city and marina square be both next door .<ssssss>however the mrt station -lrb- city hall -rrb- be still a good five minute walk away , if you want to go to other places.hotel : the hotel be nice , but for a five star hotel i expect more .<ssssss>the friendliness of the staff have be average .<ssssss>i miss a explanation of the basic thing , such as breakfast , internet access , pool and so on - nothing !<ssssss>certainly i could have ask , but i guess customer would appreciate it to get a short overview.the room have be nice , but the level of cleanliness should be improve .<ssssss>during my whole stay the mirror and the shower have not be 100 % clean as you would expect it from a 5 star accomodation .<ssssss>on my date of departure i could see why , because the room maid think i have already leave .<ssssss>she rush through the room and use my old towel to clean the shower cabin.the hotel pool be quite nice .<ssssss>i do not use any restaurant , so i can not review these .<ssssss>checkout be efficient and correct .<ssssss>return home , i realize that i forget two pair of trousers in a wardrobe in the room .<ssssss>i use the e-mail function of the hotel 's website to contact they ; after one week i have not get any response yet.in general , ok for a 3 or maybe a 4 star , but not for a 5 star .<ssssss>there be less expensive hotel in singapore which provide the same or even a better service.maybe the hotel should not sell its room cheap on the web .<ssssss>a better way would certainly be to improve the quality .<ssssss>i be sure customer would spread the word-of-mouth then and help the hotel to fill its room .<ssssss>

2 2 3 4 2 2 2 4		noisey , bad bob my wife and i stay at the resortquest waikiki beach hotel at the end of june .<ssssss>on we arrival , everything go smooth and the staff be friendly and efficient .<ssssss>we go to we room and find that housekeeping be still clean the room so we go back to the front desk .<ssssss>a supervisor apologize for the inconvenience and say she be âupgradingâ?us to a better room .<ssssss>the new room have a ocean view which wasnât bad but it be located right above tikiâs bar and have 2 double bed instead of the king we have request when we make we reservation .<ssssss>since we be tire from we flight we think we would give the room a try .<ssssss>needless to say , the noise from tikiâs and try to sleep on a small bed be horrible and we get little sleep that night .<ssssss>the next day after return from pearl harbor we go back to the front desk to see if we could change room .<ssssss>after watch the guy behind the counter play with he keyboard for 10 minute he tell we the only thing available would cost we a additional $ 60 a night !<ssssss>we tell he we wouldnât pay any more for another room and that we have request a king bed and a room on a higher floor and he response be that room be not guarantee .<ssssss>so after another 5 minute of keyboard punching he say a room with a king bed would be available the next day which we say would be fine .<ssssss>then he inform we that in order to change room we would have to check out the next morning and recheck in after 3pm !<ssssss>we think that this be very unusual and question he to see if we hear he correct and be again tell the same thing .<ssssss>be quite irritated with this guy , we say okay and go to we room .<ssssss>after we get to we room , we decide that check out and back in again be a disaster wait to happen with this place .<ssssss>my wife call the front desk and speak to a supervisor and explain the situation and be tell that we do not have to check out and back in again and to just keep we belongings in the room until we be ready to switch room .<ssssss>the next day we hope that the third time a charm , well let just say that we do get a king bed with a just little less noise .<ssssss>we decide that since it be we anniversary we werenât go to let the poor service ruin we trip.the next disappointment be the breakfast on the beach or bob for short .<ssssss>the selection of breakfast item be nothing like the brochure or website lead you to believe .<ssssss>it have the basic continental breakfast item , coffee , juice , milk , cereal , pastry , yogurt , bagel -lrb- no cream cheese ! -rrb-<ssssss>, and fruit cup , along with some oriental item .<ssssss>then there be this cold egg substance that be either roll in a tortilla , on a bun , or in a plastic container with cold greasy tater tot that be really quite nasty and i almost forget , the cold french toast stick .<ssssss>burger king across the street be a inexpensive breakfast if you be look for breakfast that actually have meat .<ssssss>the room be a bit on the small side .<ssssss>even with just 2 people and luggage the room be cramp to move around in .<ssssss>the elevator seem to just do whatever .<ssssss>they go up when the arrow say go down and if you donât get you card in the slot and floor select quickly you get to go all the way to the top floor then back down to the lobby and then maybe back to you floor.on a upside , what you see in the brochure and website be what you get as far as the dÃ©cor of the hotel and the room go .<ssssss>the room be clean except for the very dusty vent and the king bed be comfortable for a hotel bed and with the exception of keyboard guy the staff be friendly and helpful .<ssssss>there be a wolfgang puck express which have tasty pizza and sandwich and a subway and coldstone at the hotel .<ssssss>the location across the street from the beach be a plus and a lot of the tour bus pick up at the hotel .<ssssss>the hotel be within walk distance of shopping or you could catch free shuttle to hilo hatty , aloha tower , or the ala moana shopping center .<ssssss>for a few dollar you can arrange a shuttle to the aloha stadium flea market which have great price on souvenirs.overall , we be very disappointed with we choice of hotel .<ssssss>the good point just be not enough to outweigh the bad .<ssssss>my wife and i both work in business where customer service and solve problem quickly and efficiently be a must , so the treatment we receive from the guy at the front desk leave a really bad impression on we .<ssssss>next year weâll spend the little extra for one of the higher rate hotel .<ssssss>

4 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		very nice , great price the agon frankfurter-allee be a all around great deal .<ssssss>comfortable , but small room , clean , excellent continental breakfast , very friendly staff , easily access by the u-bahn , lot of reasonably price restaurant within a short walk.the neighborhood look a bit dicey with all the graffitus , but that seem to be what much of the former east look like.i would definitely stay again , and the price -- 2 night @ 75 euro and 2 night @ 45 euro be great .<ssssss>plus , book online and you get a 5 % discount .<ssssss>my room be on the 4th floor on the courtyard side of the building and most evening late i be able to snag a wi-fi signal from the neighborhood .<ssssss>
3 3 2 5 2 5 3 3		a good deal for nyc , but average i be in new york city for a couple of day to see friend and i be look for a place @ $ 200-250 that be clean and comfortable .<ssssss>my room at the chelsea pine be reasonably cute ; it look like a tiny east village studio , minus kitchen .<ssssss>i never quite feel comfortable there , though .<ssssss>the carpet be not quite clean enough for I to walk around barefoot , the bed be obviously year old , though not horrendously uncomfortable .<ssssss>the hotel do however have a exceptional location , near many subway line .<ssssss>after this experience i realize that on my next trip to new york i need to bite the bullet and pay $ 300 + for a room in which i will feel comfortable .<ssssss>

3 3 2 4 2 5 3 -1		need update we choose the hilton hawaii village resort for we honeymoon as it look gorgeous in all the brochure .<ssssss>on arrival the hilton village tick all the right box , beautiful lobby , wonderful swimming pool , gorgeous garden , great shop etc etc. however , when we make we way to we room , which be situate on the right hand side of the rainbow tower , my expectation be clearly too high as i find the communal area and corridor to be a little bit dated .<ssssss>we room be pleasant and clean , but it definately feel as though it have see better day , and the bathroom need a lick of paint !<ssssss>overall however , it be a lovely stay , the 30 second stroll to waikiki beach certainly make up for the disappointing decor and the swimming facility be fantastic !<ssssss>eat out be not a problem either as you be central to so many thing -lrb- we decide against eat in one of the many restaurant at the village , as they be quite expensive -rrb- !!<ssssss>the experience certainly have not put we off hawaius , but we would think twice about stay at the hilton .<ssssss>
3 3 4 -1 5 -1 1 -1		rude staff the physical plant be very lovely - public area , pool , etc. - but : - i stay in westin several time a month and usually the service be very good .<ssssss>for a luxe hotel and for a westin , the staff at this property be very rude and unhelpful .<ssssss>example : - someone call herself a sales manager be incredibly snobby and snippy with I when i ask she a very simple question .<ssssss>she have chin length straight blondish hair .<ssssss>look out for she .<ssssss>- i go to the pool towel stand , which be empty of towel .<ssssss>two people be stand behind the counter , a woman in uniform and a man in a suit .<ssssss>i ask they both where i could find towel .<ssssss>they both just stare coldly at I and do not respond .<ssssss>i guess it be beneath they to answer a very standard and justifiable question .<ssssss>- some of the valet be incredibly cold and snobby , as if they be movie star and i have dare to approach and ask for a autograph .<ssssss>i be drive a very expensive car , and i tip extravagantly , so it be not on that basis .<ssssss>i have no idea what they problem be .<ssssss>the only exception that i recall be a very sweet , older asian gentleman , who be very polite and helpful .<ssssss>the worst be one of the valet in tail and top hat , a older man who bear a slight resemblance to victor garber .<ssssss>he treat we as if we be filthy street urchin who have stick we finger in he food .<ssssss>also , the heavenly bed here be the least heavenly of all the westin i have stay in .<ssssss>the mattress be not especially comfortable at all .<ssssss>

5 5 3 -1 4 -1 5 -1		a oasis of calm ... .<ssssss>this a great little hotel .<ssssss>just a few yard from time square , but feel a million mile away ... the area be the main tourist part of town , but it be also get the subway just across the street to take you downtown to the village etc , and be comfortable walk distance to fifth avenue , empire state , rockefeller , moma , central park and numerous other sights.the room and nice enough , a little small - but you can not really expect anything more in the heart of nyc.staff be very friendly , offer restaurant recommendation etc. the cafe be great - free breakfast , free coffee and cake all day , and free cheese and wine every evening .<ssssss>when you factor all that into the room rate , it be actually a bit of a bargain .<ssssss>

4 3 4 5 5 4 3 -1		pretty good i spend about 16 hour at the frankfurt airport sheraton .<ssssss>all in all it be a solid hotel .<ssssss>as other reviewer have mention , it be not easy to locate .<ssssss>however , one need to go to terminal 1 and then look for stairs/escalators lead up inbetween the b and c area in terminal 1 .<ssssss>a bridge lead one from the terminal into the hotel .<ssssss>very comfortable and stylish room and bathroom .<ssssss>as expect , the restaurant and room service be not particularly cheap , as the hotel know it have a rather captive audience .<ssssss>however , most people stay here simply to be close to the airport for a early morning flight out , and for that reason , the sheraton be a excellent choice .<ssssss>
2 2 2 5 3 3 1 2		sleepy traveller single traveler beware room be so very small but it seem comfortable at first but ask for a room not face the street or you will no gett much sleep .<ssssss>its not a great bargain if you dont even have space for you suitcase .<ssssss>staff do not care and or helpful in any way breafkast average terrible coffee and move out after the second night .<ssssss>i book 5 night .<ssssss>

4 4 4 2 4 5 3 -1		hilton anatole i would agree with most of the other recent reviews.the room be large and well decorate and with coffee make facility .<ssssss>tv do not have a huge choice of channels.check in and out be extremely fast and efficient.note this hotel be not downtown or near shop or restaurant area .<ssssss>there be nothing within walk distance of the hotel , though it be easy to locate on the feeway from airport to downtown.extremely spacious public area and nice garden outside.the hotel seem to be full with convention which do sill into the main area of the hotel due to they size .<ssssss>.<ssssss>loud and noisy but on the plus side you can pretend to be part of they and get free drink !!<ssssss>the hotel be surround by its parking lot for which you have to pay in my opinion a very high fee that should be include in you room charge .<ssssss>i would prefer a hotel closer to facility but it still be a quality hotel .<ssssss>
1 2 1 4 2 5 2 2		disappointed i return last month from a trip to this resort and be very disappointed with my stay .<ssssss>the beach in the dominican republic be beautiful and so be the beach on the property at paradise bavarro .<ssssss>the accomodation be another matter .<ssssss>the room and all of the linen smell of mildew .<ssssss>the bed and the linen be old and stain .<ssssss>the refrigerator be stock with beverage but it be difficult to get simple thing for the room .<ssssss>we have to go through a very long process to obtain a iron board and iron .<ssssss>once it be bring to we room , we be limit to a two hour use .<ssssss>the food at the hotel be terrible .<ssssss>i be not a picky eater , i generally find something i like to eat in every place that i travel to .<ssssss>this place be the exception .<ssssss>most of the food be overcook , oily , and salty .<ssssss>the meat be often very fatty or tough .<ssssss>the sausage and cold cut taste like they come out of a can .<ssssss>the food i do eat make I sick four of the five day that i be there .<ssssss>there be not much available to drink outside of the frozen mixed drink .<ssssss>they do not have normal mixer for the alcohol .<ssssss>they do not have any cranberry juice or grapefruit juice available .<ssssss>it rain two day during we stay and there be not much to do at the property during inclimate weather .<ssssss>the activity staff be inexperienced and unimaginative .<ssssss>most of the entertainment consist of karoke performance .<ssssss>most of the excursion outside the hotel be $ 75 and up and the majority of those involve water sport .<ssssss>i have a much better time in jamaica and mexico .<ssssss>
2 2 2 4 4 4 4 3		not worth the money hotel 41 boast a great location and a ` boutique ' feel , however its just not worth the high price .<ssssss>the room we have be small - barely enough space to walk around the bed , and while the decor in the bathroom be cool , and nice to look at , it do not justify the price , even moreso when the impressive look shower emit only a weak spray and not the intense experience you would expect.a drink in the bar be mar not only by the price -lrb- nearly $ 13 for a small margherita -rrb- but by the bartender whose bizarre and interesting circle of friend seem to be be present , and unimpressed by we intrusion .<ssssss>i ask if she would serve we margherita in large glass and add a little more ice , but be inform that these would then become ` large ' measure and she would have to charge I twice !?!<ssssss>we choose this hotel as a treat - a little luxury for we nyc stopover before head home - but regret the indulgence .<ssssss>
3 5 3 5 4 4 3 -1		good base for new year ok , so its not the most flash hotel in sydney but we be look to book for new year and struggle to find something that be available for a reasonable price.location be great , walk distance to main shopping area and to darling harbour/circular quay -lrb- or you can catch one of the very regular bus outside if you prefer -rrb- .<ssssss>we have no complaint about the room , it be spacious , clean and tidy .<ssssss>we have a deluxe studio with a sofa , table and chair and small kitchen .<ssssss>the room would not win any interior design award but it be functional and in good condition .<ssssss>the air con be good but the water do drip down from the balcony above .<ssssss>as someone else say , the hot water do run out if you have two people shower one after the other.overall , we enjoy we stay and have no real complaint as it be just a place to sleep and it be all about location , location , location for we .<ssssss>

3 2 2 4 4 4 4 3		breakfast disaster compare with the other palace hotel in paris , the most traditional be the raphael -lrb- even more so than the bristol -rrb- : original interior , old-fashioned service , not at all corporate or hip , like a luxurious private mansion.the room -lrb- junior suite -rrb- be very large by any standard with a luxurious bathroom -lrb- well renovate -rrb- .<ssssss>for 600â ?<ssssss>per night , the room be a little worn , though , and some upgrading be necessary : more comfortable furniture , flat screen tv , hifus , etc.the reason i be rating the hotel three star be the breakfast : 36â ?<ssssss>for a low-quality and very limited buffet !<ssssss>the raphaÃ«l have a very good chef for lunch and dinner , and they should put he in charge of the first meal of the day .<ssssss>for this reason , i will not return .<ssssss>

3 3 3 5 3 3 5 -1		old-fashioned room stay here for 2 night whilst on business .<ssssss>the hotel itself be well located in central amsterdam though make sure you know how to find it if walk there .<ssssss>the building be impressive and the public space in the lobby be beautiful and what i be hope the rest of the hotel would look like as well.however , the corridor and room be old-fashioned and quite chintzy which be a real disappointed as i be hope for modern design in a old-fashioned building -lrb- similar to the sofitel bayerpost in munich which be a fantastic hotel -rrb- .<ssssss>i be a a-club platinum member so not sure whether i be upgrade , but my room be of a decent size , although the bathroom be not much bigger than a normal hotel room .<ssssss>the room service menu be expensive as expect and the food be ok , but nothing exceptional .<ssssss>overall , for the price of more than eur250 per night i be a bit disappointed and have expect more.don ' t get I wrong , the hotel be definitely a 5-star hotel with good service , but it be need of a refresh which the renovation program be mean to achieve .<ssssss>until that be complete i be more likely to stay in another hotel .<ssssss>if you enjoy old-fashioned classic hotel room design you will enjoy the grand , but for more contemporary design , i would suggest you look elsewhere .<ssssss>

3 4 3 5 2 4 4 -1		ok hotel my wife and i stay there for three night .<ssssss>the location be excellent , just a block from the duomo and a short walk to most everything else .<ssssss>for such a location , the price of 108 euro be perfect .<ssssss>it be a15 min walk to the rr station , certainly do-able .<ssssss>we room be adequate in size , overlook the inner courtyard .<ssssss>we could never figure out the layout of the hotel , as the corridor wind all over .<ssssss>the hotel be located on the third floor , and when you first arrive at the street entrance and go in , you feel like you may have make a mistake pick the place , as it have no attractiveness at all , and a tiny elevator .<ssssss>but when you get off on the third floor , it get much more homey .<ssssss>the front desk have a live in live room charm to it , with sofa and older upholstered chair , along with a computer for internet access .<ssssss>the room itself be adequate in size and clean , but the tv be mount on the wall and watch it from the bed be a bit awkward .<ssssss>but we do not come to florence to watch tv anyway !<ssssss>the bathroom be the main thing we dislike about the whole experience .<ssssss>it be incredibly narrow , so much so that you could hardly get off the potty without carefully adjust you limb !!<ssssss>the shower stall be also small , with a shower head that be defective , so water go everywhere .<ssssss>thank god there be a plastic shower curtain that be somewhat effective.there be also a mold problem in the bathroom , too.breakfast be good , in a large room , with a good selection of cereal , juice , fruit salad , yogurt , bread , and croissant .<ssssss>among the better one we have have in italy .<ssssss>all thing consider , it be a ok experience .<ssssss>i would consider stay there again , but would look elsewhere first .<ssssss>the price be right , the location excellent , and the food good .<ssssss>but i be not sure that i would recommend the place to my best friend for fear that they would be distressed over the bathroom .<ssssss>

3 5 3 -1 5 -1 4 -1		barcelo bavaro village , a good little inexpensive place to hang you hat !<ssssss>a little late on write this review but consider what i go through this year , in puerto plata at the bahia principe san juan , i figure i have better give the kudos where they be deserved.this little 3 + star resort far , far outweigh the 4 + sup bahia principe by a tonne !<ssssss>what i will do be compare the barcelo with the bahia so everyone will be forewarn not to go to puerto plata -lrb- or at least to the bahia principe -rrb- while we vacation at the barcelo bavaro village , we have a great time , the room , as be state in other review be a little dated and maybe need some freshen up , but hey , the bed be clean , the bathroom be clean , what more do you need .<ssssss>we have no roach or ant while at the barcelo bavaro ; i tip the maid a buck a day and take little thing from the dollar store as little gift , such as crayola pencil crayon for she child , little flash light , nail polishes/lip gloss , etc. and at the end of the trip , i give she alot of the girl summer clothes 'cause they will not be fittin ' they next year , therefore she could use they and she really appreciate it , clean towel and all every day.now , while at the bahia , the first impression be wow , until you get to you room , which happen to be in the back of the property , near the dumpster , and the sewage collection , the room suck , no door sweep on the bottom , therefore , bug , and i do not mean one or two , i mean literally , a infestation of hundred of creepy crawl millipede , on the wall , the drape , the floor , and brace yourself , the bed !<ssssss>of course we immediately request a room change , and be tell that oh most certainly we could move , but for 30 $ we per night !<ssssss>well , i do not think so !<ssssss>i be totally serious about the wormy creeper in the bed too -- i complain big time , show the maid , and the manager and they laugh at I because they think i be afraid of these little bug , they solution , i get a can of insecticide that i be to spray , really good for grow girl to inhale.food at the barcelo bavaro -lrb- bb -rrb- be good , every nite be a theme evening , one night mexican , the next perhaps , chinese , and so on , it be truly edible and always fresh and hot , with ton of variety.at the bahia principe -lrb- bp -rrb- , the food buffet be the same each and every night with the exception of a few different dish throw in .<ssssss>the food be tasteless , cold and just plain blah -- and if you be a bacon lover , there be no bacon at the bp in the morning , we be there for a week and not one slice of bacon be seen.the beach at the bb be beautiful , absolutely pristine white sand with the aquamarine colour ocean -- breathtaking -lrb- do get a few little bite from teh sand flea -rrb- but be prepare for that from read the reviews.ok , the bp -- the beach consist of hotel employee fill up huge cloth bag with the gritty thick brown sand and lie they side by side , as the tide wash the beach away , one day we walk the entire beach and it be flat , the next morning we walk it again and half the beach be go , it have be wash away , so these guy literally build the beach back up daily , the water be horrid while we be there , it be quite wavy and therefore the water itself have be churn up and be brown and filthy with sand bit .<ssssss>in neither place do we spend alot of time on the beach , for the simple reason of the flea , you do get alot of bite and they itch like mad.drinks bb beer be okay , a little watery but so be every thing else .<ssssss>you can flash a buck at the bartender and he will whip you up whatever you want fresh and forego the slushie machine drinks.over at the bp , the drink be much the same , they be slushie machine drink , spin with ice all day , so they too be quite watery , same rule apply tip a buck and you will not be sorry.staff at the bb , be friendly and accomodate , to we they provide every thing we request and be quick to do so .<ssssss>as be the maid , bartender everyone.now the bp , like i say , they laugh at we for be afraid of the crawl worm in we room , they would not move we only for a charge .<ssssss>no service at the pool .<ssssss>waiter make strange meow noise at we rather good look daughter -- do not go over well with dad !<ssssss>not accomodate what so ever , they do not speak english -lrb- or at least they do not to I -rrb- and make like they do not understand what you be say .<ssssss>there be ton of european at this resort , and some of they be very friendly while other be quite bold , but into line etc. i suppose that happen all over at this type of place , just sit back let they go first then get in line when the feeding frenzy be near be done.all in all , i would most certainly go back to the bb in a split second , the bp will never go back there as long as i live , and this place be recommend to I by the travel agent , she apparently have be there !<ssssss>i ask she if she be on glue when she be there or something , man it be a horrible spot , but of course -- ya get you kid there so you have to make the most of it for they and i suppose you be off work for the week and there be no dish or laundry to be do -- puerto plata be the grungiest place i have every see , punta cana be cleaner and less populated.hope this help , as for the -lrb- bp -rrb- just dont do it !<ssssss>you know how when the bus come to pick you up to take you to the airport , most of we sorta feel like oh this be it , and sort of loiter around the bus , well at the bp people be actually fight to get on the bus to get outta there asap -- honestly it be that bad !!!<ssssss>
1 4 3 5 4 3 1 -1		great hotel - poor managment - terrible experience i be a local and have stay at this hotel many time in the past year and up until 2007 this be a great hotel to stay in .<ssssss>i will start with the bad .<ssssss>during this year i have stay at this hotel twice and both of the time i have have a very unpleasent experience due to the hotel manager and new hotel policies.the first time i stay there be no double room available so we book a single for I and my family .<ssssss>when we go to use the pool only 2 people be allow to use the pool and the additoinal person my 3 year would have to pay 21 dollar per day in order to use the facility -lrb- minus golf , pool , ect -rrb- or i would have to book a additonal room and spend the night away from my family .<ssssss>so if you arrive let say at 6:00 pm and the pool close at 8:00 pm you still have to pay 21 dollar for the use of the pool ... $ 21 dollar for 2 hour be quite expensive plus $ 21 for every additonal day .<ssssss>as a consumer these rule be ridiculous .<ssssss>when talk to the hotel manager the first word out of she mouth be no you may not use the pool unless you pay the aditional fee weather its 2 hour or the full day you still have to pay for the 3rd person .<ssssss>in my opinion no minor child should have to pay a additonal $ 21 fee to use the pool especially a daily fee - one of the reason for choose this hotel be becaus we son love the pool .<ssssss>on we second stay we stay from sit thru mon. sit and sunday we go out on we boat so we do no use the amenety .<ssssss>on monday we plane to spend the afternoon at the pool .<ssssss>check out be at 11:00 be ... so we have breakfest at there restaurant and check out and plane to use the pool for the remain of the afternoon because well we promise we 3 year old that we would take he to the pool .<ssssss>when we go to pool again we be tell we could use the pool not because of the $ 21 fee but becuase you be no longer alow to use the pool or any of the hotel amenity once you have check out or before you have check in .<ssssss>again we talk with the hotel manager -lrb- very rude and unprofesional lady -rrb- ... she very first word be no - no you may not use the pool if you have check out of the hotel .<ssssss>my son burst in tear ... so do my wife becuase she would have to brake she promise to my son .<ssssss>we ask the hotel manager if she would make a exception for that day since we have promise we son we would take he to the pool .<ssssss>she see he in tear and say absoultly not check out be at 11:00 am and the use of we amenity after that time be stickly prohibit .<ssssss>bare in mind , if you stay for one night and you plan to use the pool and let say you arrive and 4:00 pm -lrb- check in time -rrb- you may use the pool and hotel amenity from 4:00 pm to 8:00 be on the arrival day and from 8:00 be to 11:00 be on the follow day .<ssssss>dont plan to stay the full day because they will literally kick you out of the hotel / pool and any other amenity they offer.it be very disapointing experience for I and my familiy and i will never use this hotel again unless these new policy be revise .<ssssss>also , the hotel manager need some people skill .<ssssss>the word no should be in there vocabulary .<ssssss>instead they should always try to find a way to please the customer .<ssssss>it be a shame becuase the hotel be quite cozy and have a execellent pool but the hotel management and new policy and rule can make you stay a very regretfull experience.a mayorbayamon , pr<ssssss>
