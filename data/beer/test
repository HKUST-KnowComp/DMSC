#user#		#product#		9 8 5 10 10		i acquire a six-pack of this excellent brew in a trade with natasharai , and now i be go to need more of it every time it be release !<ssssss>appearance : black wheat pour a opaque dark , dark brown , border on black .<ssssss>i have have a handful of beer that pour darker -lrb- dark lord , storm king , and other russian imperial stout -rrb- , but this stuff be pretty dark .<ssssss>robust carbonation yield a four-finger , light khaki head in my 22-ounce weizen glass -- it be a good thing i opt for a glass with this much extra room !<ssssss>after a few minute , the head settle into a nice half-finger cap that remain throughout drinking .<ssssss>lacing be a bit on the `` soapy '' side , but it be there .<ssssss>smell : invite .<ssssss>i pick up roasted caramel and oatmeal aroma , in addition to a hefty dose of familiar german hefeweizen yeast .<ssssss>the wheat 's in there , too , but the predominant aroma be roasty and yeasty .<ssssss>give that hefeweizen , weizenbock , stout , and doppelbock be my favorite style , this beer smell like a blend of a lot of my favorite thing !<ssssss>my only complaint be that the smell be rather subdue , congruent with the mouthfeel -lrb- see below -rrb- .<ssssss>taste : jackpot !<ssssss>this stuff be what dream be make of for a guy like I .<ssssss>all my favorite aspect of stout -lrb- roasty/chocolatey goodness -rrb- , wheat beer -lrb- yeast and wheaty sweetness -rrb- , and doppelbock -lrb- cracker-like , dry maltiness -rrb- be on full display in this masterpiece .<ssssss>it share several of these feature with black lager , a style i also enjoy .<ssssss>it be get the light , refreshing quality of a hefeweizen , back by the dry , roasted , malty vigor of a solid stout or doppelbock .<ssssss>i should note that oats be part of the grain bill on this beer , and that flavor certainly come through nicely -- i taste prominent echo of samuel smith 's oatmeal stout , which i love .<ssssss>outstanding !<ssssss>mouthfeel : this be the most/only disappointing aspect of black wheat .<ssssss>with all those strong and fulfil flavor , i would expect a much fuller body , with some creaminess to sustain the beer as i sip it .<ssssss>unfortunately , behind the initial prickle of hefeweizen-style carbonation , the beer be rather watery and empty in the mouth .<ssssss>if new glarus could just boost this beer 's body and perceive volume , it would be nearly perfect .<ssssss>drinkability : at 5.7 % abv , black wheat do not hit very hard , which be just fine .<ssssss>it be like drink a super-extra-ultra-dunkel hefeweizen , or a weizenbock without the extra alcohol .<ssssss>i could put away three or four of these in a session , which be a interesting thought : this be certainly a sessionable beer , belie by its ample roastiness and overall `` oomph . ''<ssssss>it manage to be refreshing , mildly warm , cozy , and relatively light , all at once .<ssssss>great stuff .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		8 9 7 7 7		2008 vintage pour into my new belgium globe glass .<ssssss>a - clear golden-amber in color with a frothy , white head that leave some spotty lacing as it settle to a dense , foamy ring .<ssssss>s - fermented dark fruit , cook apple , and a rich malt backing that smell sweet , fruity , and slightly toasty .<ssssss>t - thin flavor of dark fruit and malty sweetness stop half way up the palate and linger on the front of the tongue , leave I in anticipation of a lasting , flavorful finish that never arrive .<ssssss>instead , i get a watery and slightly metallic taste that be sort of unsatisfying .<ssssss>this be quite a contrast from what the rich , boozy aroma promise .<ssssss>m - the moderate amount of carbonation feel just right for this beer , but the body be thinner than i would have like .<ssssss>d - i have no problem finish a entire bottle , but that be mainly because i keep wait for the flavor to fully develop .<ssssss>i be expect a lot more from this beer .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		7 7 7 9 7		the first thing to notice be this beer pour a dark orange , much darker than most saison .<ssssss>head be cream-colored and thick , rise above crystal-clear orange beer .<ssssss>the first taste be much less tart than you might expect from a brettanomyce beer -- instead , you taste ripe cherry and dark musty plant matter , like a pile of fall leaf or wet bark .<ssssss>there be also a bit of the `` bandaid '' brettanomyce flavor , but it be not nearly as pungent as a box of the real bandage -- more like a hint of plastic funkiness .<ssssss>the wild flavor be support by just a twang of acetic acid .<ssssss>the saccharomyce have not deliver the usual earthy and peppery flavor of a saison , though there be plenty of fruit ester and a hint of spiciness .<ssssss>the malt be thick and caramelly , with hint of dark caramel and a solid body of medium , sweet caramel flavor .<ssssss>like a good saison , this beer finish sufficiently dry , a feat consider the sweet caramel and thick body .<ssssss>perhaps the brettanomyce have contribute significantly to the effect of the dry finish .<ssssss>the alcohol be present and noticeable in every sip , but not so fusely to be unenjoyable .<ssssss>you could not classify this beer as dangerously strong , because nobody will have illusion about the beer 's strength .<ssssss>but the strong alcohol flavor and the bizarre brettanomyce flavor certainly go together to make the effect of a big rambunctious beer , mean to be enjoy on its own or maybe with a spicy cajun seafood dish .<ssssss>not a bad beer to showcase brettanomyce , either .<ssssss>you could try saison imperiale alongside orval and a dry lambic to get a feel for the range of flavor that genus of yeast be capable of .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 5 9 9 8		review be from note take on 4/15/2010 at the brew pub and from the tap to a pint glass .<ssssss>appearance : pour be a pretty perfect coppery color and start with a 1/2 finger head that fade to a thin and uneven skim with a thick and foamy ring around the surface ; body be pretty clear and show moderate carbonation ; nice wash of delicate lacing hold to the side of the glass and remain while i nurse this one down .<ssssss>smell : pretty weak and hard to pull much out at all -- i be a little disappointed in this notion as i typically find beer on-tap to be a little more potent in the nose .<ssssss>overall , there be a light but pleasant maltiness that come out and it just smell sweet and good .<ssssss>taste : very nice !<ssssss>there be some great bitter citric hop right up front and they be balance out quite well by a fairly complex malty backing !<ssssss>i do not expect this level of hoppiness in this beer base upon the weak smell !<ssssss>the malt be super strong and toasty and biscuity as well and seem to be the dominant flavor , but still allow the bitterness and citric flavor of the hop to shine through ; just a bit of a alcoholic vapor in the flavor at the far end -- but not too bad for something that be 9 % .<ssssss>mouthfeel : wonderfully thick and creamy -- carbonation be just about perfect and keep the body lively ; ton of stickiness be leave all over the mouth and hold the multitude of flavor amazing well .<ssssss>drinkability : a sipper for sure , but amazing flavor and a near perfect mouthfeel make up for the higher abv and would definitely keep I come back for more .<ssssss>great for anytime of year , but i could definitely see I enjoy this one in the early spring and fall .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		8 8 8 6 7		tap pour dark brownish red and opaque with a bit of lacing .<ssssss>smell of lightly toast element and a bit of dark sugar malt .<ssssss>taste a bit buttery with some strange dark fruit sweetness and winter spice , along with a little hop .<ssssss>thicker feel with little carbonation .<ssssss>interesting beer but do not really appeal to I for some reason .<ssssss>the taste be just not what i be expect .<ssssss>sort of weird flavor combination , closest to a winter warmer maybe but more potent .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		9 10 8 8 8		i have hear a lot of hype about this beer , so my expectation be pretty high .<ssssss>pour from the bottle into a pint glass , beer be a copper-orangish color with a nice two finger sudsy head .<ssssss>the smell be a hop lover 's dream .<ssssss>a range of hop smell from sweet and citrusy to floral and piney .<ssssss>truly a treat for the nose .<ssssss>taste be surprisingly sweet , nicely balance with the intense hop .<ssssss>the alcohol do come through slightly in the aftertaste and have a very dry finish .<ssssss>this be a full bodied beer with little carbonation .<ssssss>this be a drinkable beer , but i think the dry alcohol finish be not overly desirable .<ssssss>not a bad beer otherwise though , worth try if you love hop .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		7 6 8 9 8		good amber color with a slight chill haze .<ssssss>moderate head and lace .<ssssss>surprisingly little spice aroma .<ssssss>relatively dry malt with very light hop .<ssssss>frankly , small in the nose .<ssssss>ah , the pepper really come through in the taste .<ssssss>this start as a typical malty amber ale -- lot of malt with a low hop bite .<ssssss>but the swallow feature a low burn from the pepper and crescendo to a decent spicy touch .<ssssss>i like this blend : it be different and satisfying .<ssssss>good body and carbonation .<ssssss>if you be look for something different without go extreme , seek this beer out .<ssssss>it be original and not over the top .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		9 6 8 6 9		i believe that this be incorrectly label as a all-malt lager in the db .<ssssss>it seem to fit all the criterion for a american amber lager or -lrb- maybe i only think this because i be in san francisco -rrb- a california common .<ssssss>a : all of sfbc 's beer be unfiltered and be serve at cellar temperature .<ssssss>this come a cloudy amber with good head and lot of lacing .<ssssss>s : there be some good floral here for a lager , a fruity malt presence , as well as the cool secrecy that i expect from lager bouquet .<ssssss>t : good malt start with a spritzy and clean hop finish .<ssssss>there be a slightly metallic aftertaste which undermine a otherwise tasty beer .<ssssss>m : very smooth and well-balanced overall .<ssssss>the medium body and medium sweetness make for a great pairing with sfbc 's almond smoke rib .<ssssss>d : refreshing .<ssssss>delicious .<ssssss>overall , a solid amber lager mean to be savor in the quaint confines of sfbc 's classy tap room in north beach .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		8 9 8 7 9		drink this straight from the bottle .<ssssss>let 's dispose of the pretension , shall we ?<ssssss>great beer .<ssssss>even without pour this into a glass , a little sniff give off some sweet malty aroma & obvious cascade hop -lrb- horray ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>in the mouth it be crisp , light in body but very flavorful with slightly metallic hop bite .<ssssss>balanced , easy drinking , but flavorful enough to merit some contemplation .<ssssss>definitely not a sipper , but serve I well this evening as a `` drinkin ' beer '' with some stir-fry .<ssssss>my two cent - i get this bottle for free , and i have no idea what it cost , but i probably would not pay more than 3 buck for it .<ssssss>it be not a connoisseur 's choice , but be far better than you average 500ml can of euro-urine .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		5 3 7 5 5		thanks to greg -lrb- reagan1984 -rrb- for this gem .<ssssss>the label be amazing - there be a super surreal photo of a golden retriever and black cat snuggle in front of a pleasant landscape .<ssssss>serve in a darkness glass .<ssssss>a - and it be a gusher - not promise for a english brown ale .<ssssss>quick-dissolving white foam settle to a thick collar , some patchy wisp , and a few splotch of lace .<ssssss>hazy cider brown body .<ssssss>s - wow - this smell bad .<ssssss>there be a bit of nut brown ale in the periphery , but it be overwhelm with vomit , perfume , grain , apple , and steam carrot .<ssssss>t - taste be actually a bit better - less off flavor , and merely just a boring english brown ale .<ssssss>some nut , toffee , cocoa , and apple .<ssssss>there be a mildly astringent leafy and herbal note in the finish .<ssssss>not good , but not awful like the aroma .<ssssss>m - medium body , medium carbonation , dry roasty finish , and no alcohol .<ssssss>somewhat chalky .<ssssss>d - the smell be horrendous , but otherwise this be just a mediocre english brown ale .<ssssss>look forward to more offering from andrew 's brewing !<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 7 6 9 8		just have this on tap over at the dilly deli , and it be my first mt .<ssssss>carmel beer -lrb- kind of blasphemous since i have be in the cincinattus area for almost a year now , but hey , better later than never -rrb- , and i be not disappoint .<ssssss>i have hear some concern from some fellow bas that there be sometimes a metallic/tin-like taste that be occasionally find in beer from mt .<ssssss>carmel , but may be i be lucky because i do not come across that at all .<ssssss>appearance : come to I a nice , solid dark brown ; not much light come through but it also appear to be a little cloudy ; come with a quickly fading 1 finger head that fall to a faint skim and rink around the top .<ssssss>i especially like the color and think it be solid .<ssssss>smell : not especially discerning at first , but there be definitely some malty sweetness to it , as well as a fruit-like sweetness -lrb- i think of banana for some reason , but that may or may not be entirely accurate , perhaps raisin - no real similarite there , so take that for what it be worth -rrb- ; there be a slight nuttiness to it in the back , but as it warm up it become much more prevalent and that be please .<ssssss>taste : much like the smell , the sweet maltiness be there , as be the fruit-like sweetness .<ssssss>the taste of this mild fruit-like bit still remind I of banana , but more along the line of artificial banana flavoring - still , i like it because it be mild .<ssssss>there be a slight hint of nuttiness in the aftertaste at first , but again , as it warm this presence become much stronger , make it much more enjoyable .<ssssss>i must say , this beer be probably serve a little too cold , but fortunately i be have dinner with a good friend and the conversation make it easy to allow the beer the sit and warm appropriately to a better suit temperature .<ssssss>very nice by the end and there be really no hint at all of alcohol in it as i would think this style be typically not overly high in the abv category , which help make this a very pleasant tasting nut brown .<ssssss>mouthfeel : nothing overly special about it , but it be fairly refreshing ; moderate carbonation and a mildly sticky coating .<ssssss>average for the style .<ssssss>drinkability : i would give this a fairly high rating here as it be easy to drink , would go well with several type of food -lrb- i have mine with fish and chip , but this would probably be even better with pasta -rrb- and the abv would allow it be drink in session .<ssssss>i could likely get through several of these in a sit .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 9 7 6 6		as wildfire brewing soon change its name to 10 barrel brewing , some beer with fire-themed name such as this will be rename .<ssssss>i do not know what this one will end up as , but i have it on good authority that the recipe will remain unaltered .<ssssss>in most case that would be a good idea .<ssssss>but backdraft be the least drinkable of the four wildfire beer i have on a recent jaunt to bend .<ssssss>it begin well enough with a mind-blowing hop aroma .<ssssss>usually there be something lose between the hop cone or pellet you hold in you hand before brewing , and the perceive taste or smell that end up in the beer .<ssssss>but in this beer , nothing be lose .<ssssss>the taste and the smell be as immediate and fresh as in any beer i have ever have .<ssssss>moreover , the sensory spectrum between taste and smell be wonderfully obscure here .<ssssss>the smell fall neatly into the taste and vice versa , as if you be tasting the smell or smell the taste .<ssssss>i suppose at some physiological level you actually be , but it be uncommonly express here with a resinous potency of floral , spicy hop .<ssssss>my main critique of this ale would be that it be actually too hoppy .<ssssss>that be right , too many hop .<ssssss>there be no balance to latch onto and the flavor be unrelent .<ssssss>if hop be express in term of electric currency , this beer would be like sit in a electric chair .<ssssss>it just zap the sens with high voltage hop beyond the point of comfortable consumption .<ssssss>drink it as a `` extreme '' beer if you like , but do not count on subtlety .<ssssss>at least you can tell backdraft be brew with pellet , because the leaf material of whole cone hop would have corrupt the mouthfeel at this level of hoppiness .<ssssss>the lack of intrusive tannic astringency with this much hop flavor could only be gain from the utilization advantage derive from hop pellet .<ssssss>the rest of this ale may be describe as deep amber with enough crimson blush to pass for a red ale .<ssssss>it have no lace and a rimmed head .<ssssss>base strictly on my own preference , i be grade this one at mid-range .<ssssss>but if you need a hardcore hop fix and you have no further use for you taste bud for the evening , this one will do .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		7 6 6 3 4		i have hesitate to review this in previous year , because it be a beer i really want to like and other people like , and i figure , hey , I not really be too fond of it be probably because i have not have enough of these thing .<ssssss>it be from sam adam and the label artwork be outstanding .<ssssss>the beer i find lack , though .<ssssss>there be a sweet taste that sort of overwhelm it that i find off-putting .<ssssss>the taste remind I of something that be in the winter lager in a much more balanced way , but just overwhelm this beverage .<ssssss>i be not against sweet thing , but whatever this be in particular just do not work in this quantity .<ssssss>it also drown out the porter/stout aspect of thing -- this be nothing like sam adam ' vastly superior cream stout , or a guinness , or anything like that , dark coloration of the beer itself aside .<ssssss>even the hop profile here be stronger than the real `` stout/porter '' profile i look for .<ssssss>it also do not go down very smoothly .<ssssss>it take I forever to finish one of this thing in small sip .<ssssss>have say all that , i can get they down .<ssssss>they be not something i would classify as bad beer per say .<ssssss>they do not stop I from get the sam adam winter classic mix pack , and i do not approach they with dread or anything when it come time to have one .<ssssss>i would just way prefer that they bring back the cream stout to the mix pack in the porter 's place .<ssssss>in fact , since the label artwork be the porter 's strong suit , let 's keep the label and use the cream stout recipe .<ssssss>they could call it `` sam adams holiday cream stout '' -- best of both world .<ssssss>; -rrb-<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 4 5 6 5		i half expect a beer name ` hollandia ' to be orange but the fact that it be a bright , pale yellow be the first indication that the most -lrb- and possibly only -rrb- dutch thing about it be that it resemble heineken .<ssssss>but i will not say it do not look good - perfectly clear , amply bubble and lustrous , this be a good lookin ' lager regardless of where it be from .<ssssss>it would not have kill bavaria brouwerij to be a little more discrepant when use adjunct .<ssssss>i understand the appeal of dilute the beer , but be not there a way of do so without make it smell as though it be be filter through a industrial vat of corn syrup ?<ssssss>hold the beer too close to you nose result in a reaction similar to the ' 2 girl 1 cup ' video .<ssssss>off the bat i find hollandia more palatable than the other two brand i have try from this brewer -lrb- bavaria and bavaria 8.6 , both remarkably bad -rrb- .<ssssss>while it have little to no actual malt flavour , the presence of industrial adjunct be only moderate .<ssssss>nevertheless , there be that cloying canned corn taste that plague all poorly make industrial lager .<ssssss>i imagine this beer might fare better in a blind taste test - i can not be sure that my regrettable past experience with this brewery have not taint my opinion of it - although a different label would not change the beer 's very syrupy texture and aftertaste .<ssssss>it be quite off-putting and belong more in fountain soda or the table syrup at cheap diner .<ssssss>just because a suit be make in italy do not make it a good suit .<ssssss>and just because a beer be brew in holland , a country with rich brewing heritage , do not make it any better of a beer - certainly not when it be brew to resemble every other insipid yellow lager on the market .<ssssss>hollandia should be somewhat of a disgrace to self-respecting dutch beer drinker .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		7 9 7 7 7		i cant help but compare this to harmon regular puget sound porter and unfortunately that go to work against it .<ssssss>its my understanding that the vanilla porter be a summer seasonal brew to the same specification as the regular porter only with three large madagascar vanilla bean allow to age for ten day in each keg .<ssssss>the unfortunate part of this be that harmon regular porter be so extraordinary that the vanilla can only detract from its brilliance , not enhance it .<ssssss>in this case , while the vanilla lend some exotica to the fragrance , it be ultimately marginalize in the taste make this a nice porter with a arrest aroma whose vanilla attribute be too timid to appreciate , yet too prominent to ignore .<ssssss>several renowned beer writer have give this beer glowing review in a nationally distribute beer magazine .<ssssss>i wont disagree with they praise except to say that harmon regular porter exceed this to such a degree that this one pale in comparison .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 9 7 8 6		750 ml p : this beer pour a burgundy-shaded plum with some huge chunk of yeast float around in it , similar to they grand cru i recently have but at least this one do not gush !<ssssss>i be not able to put too much head on it due to the careful , controlled pour in a attempt to `` strain '' the beer free from the coagulated protein .<ssssss>but , what be there be a light tan , fluffy head that do show decent retention for a 10 % brew .<ssssss>a : dark fruit be definitely the leader of the pack when it come to the aroma .<ssssss>smell like raisin , fig , plum , and prune all mix up in a ripened fruit jambalaya .<ssssss>also , some brown sugar , caramel , sweet malt , and some spice round out what turn out to be , by far , the most impressive aspect of this beer .<ssssss>t : i say the nose be the most impressive because the taste be just waaay too damn sweet .<ssssss>in fact , it kind of strike I like a quad in that regard .<ssssss>once again , dark fruit rule the roost with beautiful flavor of rum-soaked raisin , fig , prune , and black cherry .<ssssss>the deeply toasted/very lightly roasted sweet malt combine with the brown sugar , candy sugar , caramel , and toffee to overwhelm my taste bud with a colossal-sized wave of sweetness .<ssssss>the only thing to balance it out seem to be a peppery-like spicy yeast and just a hint of hop bitterness that do not even come close to take the edge off .<ssssss>m : the mouthfeel of this one be medium-full with a slick , oily , mouth-coating quality that become a little cloying after awhile .<ssssss>plus , the fact that you can actually feel the blubbery chunk of yeast be not the most appealing aspect of this beer , which definitely hurt the score .<ssssss>note : well , from what i can tell , brasserie des rocs seem to have some quality control issue .<ssssss>the grand cru be quite chunky and gush like old faithful , while this one have huge chunk in it as well .<ssssss>i take the first couple of sip when it be a little colder , and come close to make it a drainpour due to the overwhelming sweetness of this chunky beverage .<ssssss>but , once it warm up a bit it improve tremendously ... like all belgian seem to do !<ssssss>end up bump the flavor score up as a result .<ssssss>in the end , i be a bit disappointed by this one , though .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>my take on this ... it be a 10.54 % dipa , yeeeah , you will most likely taste some booze in it .<ssssss>whachaexpect ?<ssssss>i agree , it be hoppier in year past and be good but this year i find it much more balanced while still be a total hop bomb .<ssssss>maharaja be for the over-the-top hop head and who i think avery be cater to and be try to achieve when brewing this beer .<ssssss>well do .<ssssss>a - blood orange and just a little bit cloudy in the guinness glass i pour it in .<ssssss>darker caramel orange than the bright vibrant orange i be use to see in dipa .<ssssss>not much head retention or lacing to speak of .<ssssss>s - imo the best aspect of this beer .<ssssss>pungent dank hop , ton of pineapple upfront , dank resin , caramel candy apple and it you look for it , faint mango in the background .<ssssss>smell big and intense .<ssssss>this one let 's you know it mean business .<ssssss>t - follow nose very close with a spicy and maybe a peppery finish .<ssssss>yes , the booze it detectable but i fall it be mask very well for the abv .<ssssss>better balanced than in year 's past and this beer be most definately juicier than i ever remember it be .<ssssss>get 's a bit sweeter and heavier on the caramel apple hop flavor as it warm and the bomber come to a close .<ssssss>m - well , possibly the booze but this be like hop motor oil .<ssssss>could have be carbonate just a tad bit more but i be not complain .<ssssss>heavy , chewy for sure on the palate .<ssssss>this be a one bomber and do beer .<ssssss>not just because of the abv but because it be so chewy .<ssssss>o - the ultimate hop fix for a hophead .<ssssss>i feel this be a much better do hoptimum ... it take all hoptimum 's potential and reach it .<ssssss>yes yes , i know maharaja have be around much longer than hoptimum but i be try to give a better idea those newer ba that can make sense of this comment .<ssssss>final thought - 2011 maharaja mask the booze better this year .<ssssss>really , only 3 dipa at 10 % or above have mask booze better .<ssssss>younger , hopslam , terrapin side project 12 hopzilla .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		5 8 10 9 9		hmm , this sound like a oddity .<ssssss>per the bottle , this be a unfiltered brown ale age in palo santo wooden barrel from paraguay -lrb- neither the bottle nor they website specify whether the wood be bulnesia sarmientoi or bursera graveolen , which be both call palo santo -rrb- .<ssssss>a 12 % wood-aged brown ale ?<ssssss>sure .<ssssss>serve in a snifter/goblet from a bottle dated september 2010 .<ssssss>when pour , i be suspicious that the `` brown ale '' designation be more marketing than anything else ; `` marron '' would be easier to sell than `` negro '' in this country , but that be what the beer look like .<ssssss>black , black and more black , like a stout or a porter .<ssssss>the head be also the same colour one would find in a big stout or porter , coffee-with-cream .<ssssss>thanks to the alcohol , there be barely any head retention , and the foam soon recede to a thin wisp .<ssssss>when i smell the beer , however , i know i be in for a treat .<ssssss>sweet aroma of caramel and rum-soaked candy come first , with some booze and what i can only assume be the palo santo wood .<ssssss>not be familiar with specific wood aroma , i will only say that it smell `` woody '' but not like oak .<ssssss>maybe a bit of vanilla there .<ssssss>`` wow ! ''<ssssss>be the first thing i write down after i taste it .<ssssss>everything i mention above be present in the flavor , and join by ester , raisin , dark fruit , and a additional blast of caramel and vanilla .<ssssss>i suspect that be from the wood .<ssssss>am i drink a aged english-style barleywine here ?<ssssss>you could certainly fool I if i be blindfold , this have all the right sweet malt flavor of a proper english barleywine beer age to perfection .<ssssss>apart from the brewer 's descriptor `` brown ale , '' i would say the only thing distinguish this from a barleywine be the appearance .<ssssss>it look like a stout , but taste and smell like a barleywine .<ssssss>yet , somehow they manage to preserve the mouthfeel of a brown ale , which be much thinner than a barleywine .<ssssss>wow , this be a incredible ale .<ssssss>* eight month tasting note * this be not very hot to begin with , but the alcohol have smooth out somewhat .<ssssss>the vanilla flavor from the wood be stronger , remind I even more of a vanilla-spiced barleywine .<ssssss>the biggest flavor change seem to be the dark malt .<ssssss>a chocolate/fudge flavor not notice when it be fresher have start to shine through .<ssssss>this always look like a stout , but until now it have not taste like one .<ssssss>i think i will come back to my last bottle in a year or so , but it still taste damn good .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		7 5 6 4 6		the most non ipa ipa i think to come across my palate.poured a clear medium golden with a fluffy 1/2 finger white head that have decent lasting power , now how many american brew ipa 's be clear golden ?<ssssss>still a decent pour.absolutely no hop profile in the nose except maybe a hint of laundry soap , its mainly toast grain and light biscuit malt.again flavor exert no hop profile , a little watery mouthfeel make the beer even fall more flat.its a basic golden ale in my mind with a very faint floral hop presence , its light and grainy eh just bad .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		7 5 6 7 4		never have a double pil before , so i be no expert on the style , but compare with other craft pil i have try , i can see why this be indeed a odd yet tasty beer .<ssssss>lighter orange rather than that yellow i know , it be more the color of malt liquor with similar head retention , and look .<ssssss>however , it look fuller so it get better than average .<ssssss>plus , it have the bead of beer when pour ... smell be odd .<ssssss>at first it smell fruity but when pour into the glass , i would could detect a odd `` catsup '' smell and slight hoppy note it also have a sugary scent that scream malt liquor .<ssssss>mouth be good , and have a nice foam and go down be a little thicker than most .<ssssss>taste be not malt liquor , and that be good , but it seem almost like some octoberfest that i have have , only the hop be sudue , the malt do not make itself know but the raisin taste be there and the wheat aftertaste be also pretty good .<ssssss>so , i just do not know .<ssssss>i probably would not get this again because while it be fairly good , it be dangerously much like malt liquor .<ssssss>it be kind of like when i have a imperial porter , seem like they boost the alcohol content just to have it and that detract from a decent beer .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 9 7 7 6		750 ml bottle courtesy of hoppymeal , thanks to derek for another short 's brew , split with a friend last night , 11 of 13 in the imperial series , bottle # 326/1 ,005 , pour into my rubicon snifter a-maroon color from all the berry most likely , also some brown in there too , 3/4 inch soapy white head that leave a nice pillow once it disappear , nice rtention , some lacing s-you guess it there be ton of berry , also some butter , mostly candy-like smell , mild hoppiness in the background , grassy hop , rye , small amount of spice , and alcohol t-can really taste the one pound of fruit they use per gallon , at first seem more like wine , start off with a big berry flavor , toasty bread and chewiness in the middle , finish have lot of rye which be not as strong in the aroma , but the fruity berry be still there , some booze come to the surface once it warm more , expect it to be really fruity judge by the smell but the taste have a lot more rye and toast malt , can taste like blueberry jam spread across a piece of toast at some time as weird as they may sound , nice mixture of fruit and dry bread m-chewy , fruity , toasty , and malty mouthfeel , not as sugary in the flavor than the smell , full body with a need for more carbonation , this stuff look like cough medicine in certain shades of light , taste linger long with the stinging booze d-this be ten percent and you taste it , could not drink this bottle by myself for sure , we drink this after a clean lambic so it be go to seem heavy anyway but it be overkill in that category , should share with a few people , heavy on the stomach i be intrigue by the description of the beer alone be that it be a double golden rye ale ferment with blackberry , blueberry , raspberry , and strawberry , this brew be bottle a year and a half ago , and it seem like it will get better with even more age , this be short 's three hundredth batch too , hope i get to drink this one again , recommend , this beer be also cool because of its reference to the door<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 8 6 9 7		review # 50 !<ssssss>12oz bottle pour into a snifter .<ssssss>a - okay , belgian strong dark ... i have some idea of what to expect ... open the cap , pour and ... thick , pitch black syrup spill out ?<ssssss>alright ... a bit unusual but i will take it .<ssssss>keep pour and there be a thick , foamy , mocha brown head ?<ssssss>wait .<ssssss>who replace my beer with a stout ?<ssssss>not much lacing to be see at all .<ssssss>lot of bubble rush up the side of the glass to keep that head alive .<ssssss>s - the smell be finally reminiscent of what i have be use to for the style .<ssssss>smell be very sweet and have most note root in fig , grape , and candy dark fruit and belgian yeast .<ssssss>at the very end of the nose , i get a really warm alcohol smell .<ssssss>t - taste be initially similar to the nose ... but wait !<ssssss>this be where the appearance and nose blend together to influence the taste .<ssssss>front end of the flavor profile be sweet with the belgian sugar and candied fruit , bit of alcohol warmth .<ssssss>but as it warm up , i kind of get some stout characteristic .<ssssss>most noticeable be a roasted barley taste in the finish .<ssssss>these two different taste profile blend magnificently and make this beer really benefit from its complexity .<ssssss>m - mouthfeel be heavy with surprisingly little carbonation give the apparent carbonation in the appearance and head .<ssssss>finish be relatively short , smooth , and sweet .<ssssss>d - drinkability be moderately high .<ssssss>flavor complexity , easy finish , and low alcohol presence really aid the smoothness , but heavy body with low carbonation keep this from be a all-day drinker .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 9 6 5 4		appearance - a little darker than i like my ipa 's to look .<ssssss>brownish orange color with golden sun highlight burn around the edge .<ssssss>head be ample and a cream white in color .<ssssss>lacing be decent , but not overly impressive .<ssssss>smell - hard to complain in this department .<ssssss>heavy smattering of citrus fruit and melon , mix in with a crisp hop and a smooth malt sweetness .<ssssss>taste & mouthfeel - the nose steal the show in this one , cuase the taste do not live up to the expectation by any means .<ssssss>very bitter and tangy hop be a real turnoff , as it leave a gross twang on the back of the throat .<ssssss>some faint malt and bready taste be note , but no citrus flavor , as the bitter funk overpower much else .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium , but very dry and bite .<ssssss>drinkability - a believe this beer be a little old , and that might help for some of the poor effort bring out by this beer .<ssssss>might buy a bottle if it be fresh and i run across it again , but that should not be anytime soon .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		9 4 4 5 8		a very odd beer this one , i can not exactly put it into a particular category .<ssssss>the beer pour a nice bronze colour with a white head , very much in the standard `` pint of heavy '' look to this .<ssssss>the nose be non existant , a very faint hint of hop and a very slight hint of citrus fruit , but this take some froth on my nose before i realise this .<ssssss>the taste be very surprising , it look like a pint of heavy but taste like a lager .<ssssss>very light on the palate , mainly dominate by hop , but typical of a lager no real taste to speak of , very wattery .<ssssss>this continue through to the aftertaste , not much to speak of , a slight hint of citrus but nothing else .<ssssss>it be not a horrible beer , but just too much like a lager for my liking , at 3.9 % this would be a ideal session beer and it do go down very easily .<ssssss>my wife enjoy this more than i do , but she be not a fan of darker beer at all , she even admit that it taste very different than it look .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		9 8 8 10 9		this brew be go to be difficult to review because it be one of the rare time when i just can not seem to find the right word to describe just how satisfy a experience it be to drink ... the pour be quite impressive with a clear red-purple body and two finger of rough off-white head .<ssssss>the head stay around for a little while but eventually fall off leave a lot of lacing on the glass .<ssssss>the purple hue be a bit on the unusual side but this be , after all , a raspberry strong ale .<ssssss>the nose dispel any doubt about this drink 's raspberry-ness very quickly with a very fruity nose that be pure berry .<ssssss>the aroma be almost too sweet and even a bit on the fruity side , lead to worry this be go to be a sickly sweet alco-pop .<ssssss>no fear as the first sip confirm that this be anything but sweet .<ssssss>while the berry flavor be strong and true there be practically no sweetness to be find - this strong ale be as dry as a bone .<ssssss>there be a impressive lack of sugar which be not quite sour and not quite bitter but strongly reminiscent of a brut champagne or a very dry cider .<ssssss>i would not be the least surprised to find they use a champagne yeast to finish the fermentation .<ssssss>while the dryness be front and center the fruit flavor be amazingly fresh and true - there be no `` artificial flavoring '' note to this at all and instead it taste just like pull a fresh raspberry right off the vine .<ssssss>i would almost have believe this be a cider but for the light barleywine echo in the background .<ssssss>there be certainly some light grain note , primarily a golden barley flavor and just the slightest hint of alcohol - quite a surprise at this abv .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be dominate by the dryness with a good pucker at the end of each sip .<ssssss>no hint of hop bittering but it be not need with the other flavor in this elixir .<ssssss>this be quite a impressive strong ale and i can not imagine how you could begin to rate this `` by style '' when compare to the fine strong ale from stone and lagunita .<ssssss>but judge on its own and by the quality of the drinking experience , it be a amethyst color gem .<ssssss>when consider drinkability i often ask myself if i would look forward to have it again and a good sign be as soon as you finish the drink you look forward to the next time you might have one .<ssssss>sadly this be a seasonal brew from a small brewer on the other side of the country so it be unlikely that i will ever have one of these again .<ssssss>if you be new england during raspberry ale season -lrb- i be guess fall -rrb- make it a point to seek out this marvel ...<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 9 5 8 7		good coffee stout .<ssssss>i would put this in the better half of coffee stout that i have try .<ssssss>it have a great aroma full of both dark , roasty malt and strong , rich coffee .<ssssss>the malt have a lot of chocolate , too , which work well with the coffee .<ssssss>the taste be a bit dominate by the coffee flavor , but it be still solid .<ssssss>start nice and sweet and finish dry and bitter .<ssssss>i would guess that this be not the most caffeine-packed variety of coffee stout , which i appreciate .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thinner than expect , since the recipe be base on a oatmeal stout .<ssssss>this beer just need a bit more creaminess to show off the flavor to its full potential .<ssssss>more of the fruitier coffee note and chocolatey malt would come out with a fuller feel .<ssssss>the beer be almost wall-to-wall black .<ssssss>the side just barely glow with dark brown .<ssssss>very good beer and one of the easier to drink coffee stout that i have try .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		3 4 4 5 3		my first review for bud come at the beginning of my beer awakening , when like many early-20s beer people i take a reactionary stance against the big brand .<ssssss>also , the bud i drink really suck .<ssssss>but i have have it since , and it be not awful , so i decide to do a formal review of a bottled bud .<ssssss>the bottle art -- i be sorry to say , as much as i do not like almost all of anheuser 's marketing -- be classic .<ssssss>it be really , really hard for a label to look so simplistic while be so busy , have so many word .<ssssss>the beer itself , however , do not look good .<ssssss>it be like sun-bleached straw .<ssssss>smell like a a yeasty adjunct .<ssssss>the yeast be more pronounced and pleasant than what you get out of miller or coor , but the adjunct be not nice at all and the barley be not enough to balance it .<ssssss>taste just fine .<ssssss>i have this fresh at the brewery a few year ago and it taste very good , actually , smooth as silk and almost explosively yeasty and believe it or not there be a little hop bitterness at the back end .<ssssss>it be impossible to expect brewery freshness , though , and this bottle wear its 62 day of age very conspicuously .<ssssss>it be sweet and grainy up front , very lightly bitter on the back .<ssssss>not bad at all , but really not good .<ssssss>what just about kill bud , though -- the reason it be a firm third behind miller and coor , imho -- be that in spite of be so lightly flavor , it be really not all that drinkable .<ssssss>there be a time and a place for lawnmower beer .<ssssss>ounce for ounce , i have probably drink more grain belt and schlitz in the last year than i have all other beer combine .<ssssss>but grain belt and schlitz -lrb- and coor , and high life , and stroh 's and pbr and red dog -rrb- all have more flavor than bud , and even more importantly they be not so damn sodapop fizzy , so they do not hurt my stomach when i drink they .<ssssss>so , there .<ssssss>my last review be reactionary .<ssssss>this one be fair .<ssssss>it would be damn dishonest to say this be anywhere near the worst beer in the world .<ssssss>but it be not very good , even for what it try to be .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		7 8 8 7 4		like most of the other recent reviewer , i obtain the 2001 vintage , and consume it in april '03 .<ssssss>the bottle proclaim , `` the world 's most extraordinary beer ; '' that and the whole dec 6 brewing thing perk my interest .<ssssss>while it be indeed extraordinary , i can not really say that i enjoy it .<ssssss>what little head the beer initially have rapidly diappear .<ssssss>there be very little carbonation .<ssssss>consider that this be a austrian brew , these attribute seem out of character .<ssssss>however , i can see that higher carbonation could negatively impact the drinkability of such a stong brew .<ssssss>otherwise the appearance be nice : clear , dark and appealing red color .<ssssss>i immediately notice the aroma : very strong , much like that of a dopplebock with the volume turn up .<ssssss>the alcohol be apparent even in the aroma .<ssssss>the strength of this , however , effectively mask any other subtlety there might have be to the aroma .<ssssss>the immediate aspect of the taste i notice be the sweetness and the alcohol .<ssssss>note that i say sweetness , not maltiness ; this be a pronounced sweetness without a complex backing .<ssssss>it be much like flat root beer in this respect .<ssssss>the alcohol lurk a little while , then strike , and it strike hard .<ssssss>it be not until after a few drink that i feel the wamth in my chest , but then it be a juggernaut , break down my sobriety and composure .<ssssss>the strenght of the alcohol flavor , combine with the simple sweetness , make this a rather unpleasant drinking experience for I .<ssssss>barleywine and imperial stout - both strong , though not comprable with the likes of this and beelzebuth - provide intersting body and hop to go along with the strength ; this be a experience i prefer .<ssssss>hence , i suppose i be more critical of the style than of the actual beer .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		8 9 9 7 7		a : look like it be somewhere between porter and stout in color and texture .<ssssss>a dark mahogany brown , only translucent in the corner when hold to light .<ssssss>no sediment or haze visible .<ssssss>small amount of tan head .<ssssss>s : grapefruit , coffee , molasses , bittersweet chocolate , lemon zest , orange .<ssssss>so ... sort of like a more intense , richer version of some of the black ipa 's i have have recently -lrb- iniquity , sublimely self righteous , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>t : initial citrus bitterness and some sweetness .<ssssss>however , it be quickly chase out by darker malt tone and some dry bitterness with flavor such as coffee , toffee , and molasses .<ssssss>a bit of grapefruit mingle with the cocoa , toffee , and coffee grind in the aftertaste .<ssssss>m : very thick , rich , full-bodied flavor .<ssssss>ample carbonation and velvety at the same time .<ssssss>woah .<ssssss>d : a lot go on here .<ssssss>very thick , very full-flavored , very complex .<ssssss>could be a pro or a con depend on you palate .<ssssss>either way , the 13 % abv inhibit drinkability , unless you do not value you sobriety .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		6 4 3 6 5		a - very little head , which disappear quickly .<ssssss>look more like a soft drink than a beer .<ssssss>if it be not a pumpkin ale , appearance would be a 2 , but i give a extra point because i think the orange color suit it .<ssssss>s - very mild smell , again more reminiscent of a soft drink than a beer .<ssssss>not unpleasant , but do not contribute anything to the overall experience .<ssssss>t - pleasant , mild taste , but yet again the taste be of a pumpkin soda rather than a pumpkin ale .<ssssss>definite pumpkin flavor , however , which i appreciate .<ssssss>the flavor kick in more on the aftertaste than in the initial contact .<ssssss>m - four for four so far in be more soda-like than ale-like , but in this case it be so watery that i would expect a better mouthfeel from a soda .<ssssss>o - it be a pleasant , mild drink - nothing offensive , just nothing especially good , either .<ssssss>would probably be good as a light summer beverage on its own , but be too weak to pair with food and be not good when you be in a specific `` beer '' mood .<ssssss>okay , folk , that be my first review here .<ssssss>i do not pick the greatest beer to start with , but hopefully i do all right .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 5 9 6 6		i pick up a bottle of new holland 's dragon 's milk last month for $ 7.99 at boyne county provision .<ssssss>i have have this beer many time and i have always think it be pretty good , but since i have be try a lot of good barrel aged stout lately i think i would see how i feel about it now , so let see how it go .<ssssss>2011 vintage .<ssssss>pour from a brown 22oz bottle that be foiled into a snifter .<ssssss>a - the label on this beer be pretty simple with a picture of a barrel and dragon , the dragon look nice .<ssssss>it pour a very very dark brown color that be pretty much the closest you can get to black while still be brown .<ssssss>it have two finger worth of off white head that die down to a thin ring that stay till the end and leave no lacing .<ssssss>s - the aroma of this beer be pretty damn sweet and with a heavy presence of bourbon .<ssssss>i get a little chocolate , coffee , caramel , toffee , brown sugar , and vanilla .<ssssss>the main player in the aroma be the sweet roasted malt and bourbon , not really that balanced or complex .<ssssss>t - the taste of this beer be much different then the aroma lead I to believe .<ssssss>it start off with lot of rich malt that have a little roast to they that impart a mild coffee and milk chocolate flavor , but the malt be not nearly as roasty as they should be for a stout and the lack of roast let the other flavor show up too much .<ssssss>the malt have a moderate amount of sweetness but its tone down a lot compare to how sweet the aroma be , after that comea all the dark fruit with some date , plum , and raisin show up the most .<ssssss>after that be the bourbon which be pretty nice and oaky with a nice hint of vanilla .<ssssss>the bourbon flavor be pretty evident and seem a little harsh at first but after a couple sip it really grow on I and prove to be a nice addition to this beer .<ssssss>the alcohol be slightly warm but it do not make this beer come off as be hot .<ssssss>the finish be smooth and slightly sweet with some oak , vanilla , and bourbon show up in the aftertaste .<ssssss>m - somewhat creamy and on the light side of be full body , the lighter body make this beer have a little better drinkability then normal .<ssssss>carbonation be at the low side of medium and work pretty well with this beer , i do not think i would change it .<ssssss>overall i have to say that this be a pretty average beer , but i still find some quality that i really like about it , but as a whole it be just average .<ssssss>my main beef with this beer be that it just be not as roasty as a stout should be , if you market something as a stout it should have a good amount of roast to it , with that miss it let all the other flavor take over and in the end that do not make it very stout like and if i be give this blind there be a good chance i would think this be a barrel aged barleywine or a old ale with a slight amount of roast to it .<ssssss>i do like how drinkable this beer be , i find that barrel aging can hurt the drinkability a lot of the time , but on this beer it really do not matter and the mouthfeel do not make it too fill plus for 10 % the alcohol be not that in you face .<ssssss>i can see how some people may be turn off by the heavy bourbon and oak presence in this beer , and i think that be because there be not enough roast to balance it out , but if you sip on it , take you time , and let it warm up you will find that the flavor that the barrel impart be really nice and not as in you face as they seem at the start .<ssssss>what i like most about this beer be the mouthfeel , usually i like my stout thick as oil , but the lighter then average body really work with this beer and find it to suit it perfectly .<ssssss>what i like least about this beer be that it be call a stout , it should have much more roast , instead of a heavy presence of dark fruit that make it closer to a barrel aged old ale or barleywine .<ssssss>i will still buy this beer on occasion , it can ' r hold a candle to kb , but anytime i want a barrel aged beer it be available , and availability can play a big part in what i buy sometimes .<ssssss>i recommend this to fan of barrel aged beer , but do not expect to be blow away buy the base of this beer cause it do not live up to the name .<ssssss>even though this be pretty much the most popular beer in they lineup , there be a couple other beer from they i would rather have that be lot more to style and better tasting .<ssssss>this be the first barrel aged beer i ever have and at the time it be super robust and big , but after try much other stout i find i still like it , but not as much as i use to it and it be much more average then i first thought .<ssssss>as a whole new holland be a pretty good brewery , maybe next batch you make you can set aside some of those barrel for pilgrim dole , now that may be a epic beer , think about it .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		9 7 8 5 5		update review : 2-06-2010 this one pour a clear dark black with a creamy tan film of head that leave some nice lacing along my glass .<ssssss>smell of sour grain , sweet chocolate syrup and a funky sour cough syrup round off with a disconnect piney hop .<ssssss>taste of sweet root beer and distant chocolate that fade into a sour cough syrup .<ssssss>this then awkwardly fall into a piney hop that linger long in the finish with red grapefruit peel .<ssssss>the balance here be pretty bad .<ssssss>feel clean and airy with a soft swarm of carbonation that seem to avoid my tongue .<ssssss>a mere shadow of what this be five year ago .<ssssss>this be pretty gross , in my opinion .<ssssss>i regret buy a six-pack .<ssssss>original review : 10-04-2005 this beer pour nearly black with a slight obsidian glow .<ssssss>after a hard pour , the head look like tiny copper ball bearing that fade to white and collapse all together in a few minute .<ssssss>on the nose , there be a subtle cocktail of coffee , hop , pineapple and plumb .<ssssss>there be also a tiny bit of alcohol that i have to really sniff out .<ssssss>the flavor be absolutely amazing .<ssssss>big sticky black malt with only a slight roasted flavor that transition into fruity hop .<ssssss>to further explain the flavor of this beer , it seem that the sweetness of the malt blend into the sweetness of the hop .<ssssss>but wait , there be more .<ssssss>in addition , the dryness of the roasted malt blend into the dryness of the hop .<ssssss>so , you get a blend of caramel and chocolate malt sweetness , that be seamlessly blended with citrus and port-like hop .<ssssss>on the dry end , the coffee note blend easily into the tart plumb skin-like dryness of the hop .<ssssss>i find this to be truly amazing and unique in beer .<ssssss>my favorite aspect of this beer be that in between the transition of malt to hop all sort of fruity port , plumb , prune , red grape flavor make themselves know only for a instant .<ssssss>it really boggle the mind to drink .<ssssss>i be disappointed to only give this category a 5 .<ssssss>this be a very viscous beer with minimal carbonation .<ssssss>what little carbonation help with the dynamics of the drinking , perhaps delay the onset of the fruitiness related to the hop .<ssssss>there be a good thick body that just slide down you throat .<ssssss>i be the kind of guy who , on the hottest day of the summer , will still reach for a stout first .<ssssss>that be just I .<ssssss>i will have to say , this beer be hand down my favorite .<ssssss>not too much coffee , and some delicate sweetness with some mystical guest appearance of subtle flavor that appear out of nowhere .<ssssss>that , and the price be right on for a stronger beer .<ssssss>here be to victory !<ssssss>as a side note , the beer be far hoppier when it be cask condition at the victory brewery .<ssssss>there be big pacific north west hop flavor that dominate the roasted malt .<ssssss>this be a absolute must for the hop-head who want to take a trip to the dark side .<ssssss>however , the hoppiness of the cask detract from the subtle blend that i rate so highly .<ssssss>a +<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 6 4 3 4		the first clue to the off nature of this brew be the lack of any head -lrb- after the first 10 seconds -rrb- .<ssssss>the clincher though be the faint hint of lepage 's glue -lrb- like we use in grade school in the 1950 's -rrb- that come through as it rest on my tongue .<ssssss>i hate to be unkind , but this beer - at least the bomber i buy - be dissapointing at best -lrb- in fact i drain pour about 16 of the 22 oz . -rrb-<ssssss>it be sort of a sour , off-tasting funky mess without be enjoyably hop-bitter .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>and this be both its strength and its weakness .<ssssss>at this abv and with the intensity of flavor here this be definitely a one a night beer and a once in a while beer .<ssssss>i will welcome another chance to drink it but it be not for every day drinking .<ssssss>so what to say about drinkability .<ssssss>do i want more ?<ssssss>yes .<ssssss>do i want more right now ?<ssssss>no .<ssssss>will i seek it out in the future ?<ssssss>yes .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 2 2 2 5		why do i buy this ?<ssssss>the only good thing about this beer , be its appearance .<ssssss>the smell be pretty bad with green apple and fusel on the nose .<ssssss>the taste be make I gag , what with its alcohol taste .<ssssss>on my mouth , this malt liquor feel like greasy water , which be pretty nasty in its own right .<ssssss>i guess the drinkability be ok , but at 9 % , you might head into rocky water .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		9 10 8 8 8		huge thanks to tpd975 for crack this bottle at the rbwg at redlight redlight .<ssssss>serve in a tulip-shaped taster glass .<ssssss>a - look a lot like regular pannepot - dark , dark , brown color that verge on black .<ssssss>big off-white foam that eventually dissipate to a thin cap and leave a little lacing .<ssssss>maybe not quite as attractive as the normal version , but still quite nice .<ssssss>s - you can definitely pick out the funk - i actually find regular pannepot a little funky to begin with , but this be substantially more amp up .<ssssss>there be a lot of sweet fruitiness to the brett , with some light acetic acid and red wine in there as well .<ssssss>as expect , there be the regular backdrop of anise , dark fruit , and spice , but they have be push into the periphery .<ssssss>no trace of booze in the nose , which be a improvement over other pannepot .<ssssss>wonderful stuff .<ssssss>t - the taste be a bit of a letdown compare to the aroma - it be a bit medicinal and slightly sour , and there be a large amount of earthy and tannic bitterness in the finish that i do not remember be present in any other variant of this beer .<ssssss>this be all in addition to the dark fruit and licorice malt backbone .<ssssss>spice be less present here than in the nose .<ssssss>again , it be less boozy - i be begin to wonder if it be 100 % wild fermentation -lrb- and thus a lower abv -rrb- , but after the description it start out as regular 10 % pannepot before go into the barrel .<ssssss>i guess the add flavor and age have temper the heat of the young beer a bit .<ssssss>it be probably a 3.75 but i will round up and be a little tougher elsewhere .<ssssss>m - the carbonation be a little lower than i expect , particularly for a struise beer .<ssssss>i actually think it could use a little more sprtiz and effervescence to highlight the gueuze-like quality .<ssssss>soft , smooth , medium-full body , with a nice dry finish and minimal heat .<ssssss>d - a very interesting experiment , but again i be not sure it improve on the original beer .<ssssss>the aftertaste be pretty intense and would slow I down more than the abv , although the entire 750ml bottle would slow down even the most intrepid drinker by the end .<ssssss>i would certainly have it again , but i doubt i will ever have the chance - unless urbain make more -lrb- wink , wink , nudge , nudge -rrb- .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 8 10 6 6		presentation : squat brown pop top , nice artwork on the label , as well as pour instruction .<ssssss>no freshness date .<ssssss>ugh .<ssssss>appearance : hazy dark straw beer with a nice creamy white cap which show nice retention .<ssssss>smell : pretty standard , but pleasant .<ssssss>citrus , a wheaty tang , coriander , and a hint of cardamom perhaps ?<ssssss>taste : pretty much follow the nose exactly .<ssssss>the balance between citrus and fruity spice be just about perfect .<ssssss>the one -lrb- and it be pretty substantial -rrb- downside be that there be a weird , firm , almost medicinal bitterness that i notice when i have the first bottle of the 4-pk a couple of month ago .<ssssss>quite odd , and not something i normally associate with the style .<ssssss>mouthfeel : best mouthfeel of any wit i have ever have ; this have the milkshake-thick , smooth mouthfeel i have hear describe as ideal for the style .<ssssss>conclusion : this would be one of the best wit i have have to date , if it be not for that firm , kind of uncharacteristic bitterness , which kind of mess thing up a bit , which be too bad .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		7 9 5 7 8		i be fairly excite to try the new brew from peak organic brewing , the weiss principal ale .<ssssss>the local representative drop this one off yesterday , and it have not even arrive for sale yet .<ssssss>he describe it as the perfect marriage between a sweet hefe and hoppy ipa .<ssssss>i can barely contain my excitement !<ssssss>the weiss principal come in a crown-capped 22oz bottle , screw-top oddly enough .<ssssss>it pour out a beautiful topaz color , with a thick and fluffy white foam .<ssssss>the foam last a ridiculously long time , and leave behind a ton of sticky lacing .<ssssss>the brew be very hazy , if not completely opaque , and the resemblance to a great hefe be get I even more excited !<ssssss>the nose be dominate by the hop , very bitter , american style hop .<ssssss>i be quite surprise by how much citrus and grapefruit i be get in the aroma .<ssssss>the label describe some banana and clove from the german weiss yeast , but this smell much more like a ipa to I .<ssssss>once i take a sip , i be sorry to say , i be very disappointed .<ssssss>this have american ipa write all over it , with more in-your-face hop than i can enjoy .<ssssss>there be definitely a hint of hefe present , but it be very subtle , and over-whelmed by the ipa side of this jekyll and hyde brew .<ssssss>i be seriously not into this beer .<ssssss>however , my hop-loving friend absolutely love the weiss principal ale !<ssssss>as i near the bottom of the bottle , i give it a good swirl to stir up some of the yeast .<ssssss>i be expect the yeast to be a little more appealing to my sweet , hefe loving palate .<ssssss>well , it unfortunately do not make the weiss principal any better for I .<ssssss>sorry !<ssssss>overall , a pretty cool beer .<ssssss>it be the first hefeweizen i have ever hand to my hop-head friend that he like .<ssssss>actually , he love it , and have not stop rave about it throughout the entire bottle .<ssssss>although it be not my favorite brew , i can sincerely appreciate the creativity of the weiss principle ale .<ssssss>it really be the `` international love child of a hefe-weisse and a american ipa '' as the label state .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 8 9 10 7		from a 11.2 oz bottle with a little white horse trinket on it , pour a cocoa-black color with a minimal head ... aroma be prunish , full of coffee , latte-like with obvious malt present ... very invite ... taste be exceptional , very full-bodied and full of toffee , malt , and cappuccino-like , very thick and rich ... mouthfeel be equally great ... go down smooth and be similar to drink a dark latte ... drinkability be not exceptional , a little better than average , but the ultra-rich flavor and relatively high alcohol percentage be what restrict a higher score in that department ... overall , a classic german beer and a great representation of the style ... definitely recommend ...<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 7 8 5 7		i suppose fruit beer and lambic just be not my thing , but i could not help but try this belgian red at the new glarus brewery .<ssssss>appearance : about as close to red as beer can get , you can see the carbonation bubble fly towards the top smell : cherry , a whole pound of cherry !<ssssss>you can smell it from a mile away taste : incredibly sour , obviously i know this be a matter of palate , but i just could not handle it .<ssssss>mouthfeel : champagne dry , almost need a glass of water afterward .<ssssss>drinkability : you be not exactly go to drink this down fast , to be serve in small dose .<ssssss>definetely a beer for non-beer people , and the big fruit beer fan 's holy grail , just not for I<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 5 8 5 5		year ago , back in escondido , my sister swear by this beer , refer to it -lrb- as do many other -rrb- as hefeweizen -lrb- with no brewery designation -rrb- .<ssssss>it be serve at more than one of she pool party , softball game and get together -lrb- though thankfully not at she wedding , where we be treat to the long lose blind pig golden ale -rrb- .<ssssss>with nostalgia on my mind , i decide to try this one again , and much to my surprise , it do not impress I in the least .<ssssss>widmer pour a lovely cloudy golden orange into my proper hefeweizen glass .<ssssss>orange yeast and cinnamon hit my nose before glide down my throat .<ssssss>lemon mingle with the orange and lightly bitter hop spice to add a bit of tartness to the hefe .<ssssss>easily drinkable , there be a bit of chewy yeasty wheat goodness which last throughout the beer .<ssssss>a hefty body to carry the orange , lemon rind zest and hop spice zing which encompass the widmer hefeweizen .<ssssss>hazy yellow color , a little citrus , no noticeable banana or clove aromas/flavors .<ssssss>drinkable to be certain , and obviously americanize -lrb- for better or worse -rrb- , this one leave I feel indifferent , maybe a bit nostalgic for the middle ninety in socal , when it be all about social d , sierra nevada -lrb- or blind pig/sam adams/alesmith esb/hefeweizen/portland brewing , etc -rrb- and a good place to party for the night , maybe a bit sad that this beer still retain the popularity which it do .<ssssss>oh well , whatever .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>this beer feel very strange go down my throat , to the point that i be get a feeling in my chest more than i be in my mouth .<ssssss>i be sure the carbonation be contribute to this , but i have have more carbonated beer than this without any `` chestfeel '' sensation .<ssssss>it be not alcohol warm either , despite be 11 % abv .<ssssss>this have to be some weird effect of one of the exotic ingredient .<ssssss>drinkability for I be hinder by that `` chestfeel '' sensation .<ssssss>overall , i be not sure how to judge this accord to style since this be my first sahti experience , but i do not care for it .<ssssss>intriguing and interesting , but not pleasant .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 10 7 7 8		a light brown brew with a beautiful white head , raison de'etre 's best asset may be its bouquet -- a heady mix of -lrb- at different moment and in different combo -rrb- cinnamon , ginger , brown sugar , alcohol , glue , red wine , and raisin .<ssssss>compare to the aroma , the flavor be rather straightforward and plain jane .<ssssss>there be a strong sweetness throughout with interesting hint of fruit and dark rum .<ssssss>the drawback be that it be almost too smooth -- the sweetness need a greater dryness , spiciness , or bitterness to match it and add less cloying length to the beer .<ssssss>this be a interesting and easy-to-drink brew for something so strong .<ssssss>i be go to try and cellar a bottle or two to see what happen in the next few month .<ssssss>perhaps age will impart the dryer body that this beer need to go from good to great .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		7 8 8 3 5		appearance : to be honest , it look a awful lot like a garden-variety oktoberfest ; superclear amber-yellow with a tissue-white head .<ssssss>very respectable level of retention despite fairly large bubble and no hop or yeast for support .<ssssss>smell : plenty of peach liqueur along with a surprising and welcome touch of lambic funk - reminiscent of gueuze , with a band-aidy phenolic quality .<ssssss>sweet and very peachy through and through , with a white wine quality and a sugary character reminiscent of peach candy or even artificially-flavored strawberry milk .<ssssss>taste : sweeet !<ssssss>argh ... i think this one would be sweet , but not this sweet .<ssssss>this be like drink apple juice , with a spoonful of the `` light syrup '' from a can of peach stir in for good measure .<ssssss>a light lemony acidity be the only thing work to offset it ... and it be not enough .<ssssss>i expect sweet from lindeman , but the cassis , framboise , and kriek be not anywhere near as syrupy and one-dimensional as this !<ssssss>mouthfeel : surprisingly clean and dry , especially in the finish .<ssssss>lip-smacking and smooth , with airy carbonation ... but unfortunately , it do not do much to lighten the heavy sugar load .<ssssss>drinkability : for what it be , this be pretty drinkable .<ssssss>it taste good , like soda .<ssssss>but it be definitely not worth the price , and definitely not something i would want more than a bottle of .<ssssss>tip : have it with a sweet , fruit-and-cream type dessert .<ssssss>it will offset the overt sweet fruit flavor in the beer and draw out the tart , funky lambic tone - improve its drinkability dramatically .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		6 8 7 6 6		i be drive up to lake tahoe over labor day weekend last summer , and stop off at a raley 's in auburn to pick up lunch .<ssssss>i usually like to peruse the beer aisle when i be in `` foreign '' grocery store , hope to snag a hard-to-find favorite , or otherwise something unfamiliar but entice .<ssssss>browse the unusually deep selection , i come upon a label i do not recognize , and whose tribal design recall those print on peet 's coffee cup .<ssssss>on closer inspection i discover a style and manufacturer i would never experience .<ssssss>examine the bottle further , i discover it be `` brew and bottle for knee deep beer company by beer4u , belmont , california . ''<ssssss>this amuse I , because i would just move from belmont after live there the previous two year , but have no recollection of either company .<ssssss>it be a snap decision to purchase the tanilla porter , but find the right occasion to crack it open take significantly more discretion and patience .<ssssss>typically , when i select a bottle with the intention of enjoy it solo , i opt for something a bit more conventional , a known quantity , avoid my one-of-a-kind bottle in favor of something i can more easily replenish .<ssssss>i have more or less decide to hang on to the tanilla until i could share it as a after-dinner beer with friend .<ssssss>unfortunately , i have not have too many dinner with beer-drinking friend in the last few month .<ssssss>first , i be occupy with moving-related task , and then i be busy with rehearsal for a play that run in november , and then before you know it , the holiday be upon we ... for various reason , i decide that my new year 's resolution would be to stop buy beer for my home collection .<ssssss>even though i decide this in december , i more or less forget to stockpile `` everyday '' beer when i have the chance , and so i enter 2012 with precious few session beer on hand -lrb- mostly leftover bottle of stella from a recent party -rrb- .<ssssss>the other night , i be in the mood for a post-dinner tipple , decide what the hell , and pour myself a luscious mug of sweetly aromatic tanilla .<ssssss>i must confess that the tasting experience peak just as -lrb- no , not before -rrb- the first sip of rich porter coat the inside of my mouth .<ssssss>it be not that i do not like the tanilla , do not misunderstand I .<ssssss>it be just that the invite smell which draw my lip closer to the glass be in itself the ultimate reward after month of anticipation .<ssssss>now , perhaps i have build it up so much for myself that anything less than a instantaneous bufotenin surge would have come off as anticlimactic .<ssssss>perhaps .<ssssss>all i know be that as soon as my taste bud register the tanilla 's presence , i know that the wait be over .<ssssss>reality be upon I .<ssssss>it be , after all , just a fucking beer as for get into the specifics of mouthfeel , color , viscosity , and all that , i leave those detail to other beer advocate reviewer , and will close by say that this beer do not disappoint I .<ssssss>far from it , actually .<ssssss>and if i learn anything from the experience , it be that i need to recruit a few friendly volunteer to help bring I back down to earth a little bit , and drink my beer with I in a more timely fashion , so i do not obsess too much about find the perfect time to open this bottle or that one .<ssssss>i would not even mind reload with a fresh bottle of tanilla to share with friend -- in 2013 , of course .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		9 6 8 8 8		pour a yellow-orange color with a profuse head typical of anchor beer .<ssssss>the nose be somewhat disappointing as i only smell a generic hoppy aroma .<ssssss>the hop make they presence know much stronger in the taste , however .<ssssss>this beer be anchor 's closest beer to a ipa .<ssssss>the hop seem to have a pineapple or grapefruit profile and leave a nice coating on the tongue .<ssssss>this be a solid and easy to overlook offering from anchor .<ssssss>i would probably give slight preference to liberty ale , though .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		8 4 8 7 8		my wife pick this up and make I listen to the dead .<ssssss>go figure .<ssssss>the beer pour a nice color , and look like quite a beer .<ssssss>oddly enough , there be no detectable smell .<ssssss>the taste be quite muted as well .<ssssss>i be not really aware of the taste , but i sense a smokey aftertaste .<ssssss>it be a decent base ale , but i will probably not be spend upon it again .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 8 8 10 8		late october 2004 release .<ssssss>excellent new packaging this year immediatly catch my attention as well as the statement of the ingredient which exclude spice .<ssssss>i do not like spice in beer very much -lrb- even coriander in a wit taste crappy to I -rrb- and after have last year jubelale i carefully check to see how this year recipe be formulate and after no spice be find i pick up a six pack .<ssssss>appearance : pour a rich deep red almost burgundy with a thick light brown head that stick around for a few minute leave a little lace .<ssssss>clear as a can be with little stream of tiny co2 bubble from the soft bottle condioning .<ssssss>aroma : rich dark fruit aroma , mainly plumb with a little dark cherry , with a subtle hop accent .<ssssss>taste : begin with a rich malt flavor that be full of dark roasted malt blended with sweet caramel malt flavor .<ssssss>the dark roasted malt seem to I to be more along the line of special b or a really dark munich with the sweet malt flavor lend a very clean balance .<ssssss>the hop be present in the middle and finish of this ale and i believe be comprise of a blend of american hop to get that fresh almost earthy hop bitterness and flavor , while also be blended with noble hop variety to give a smoothness to the hop flavor round out the linger bitterness .<ssssss>great hop flavor in the finish of this ale make I take drink after drink try to figure out which variety be use but the blend be very complex with no individual variety really make a impact .<ssssss>perfectly formulate for a winter warmer i do not believe that this recipe should ever be change in the future in order to maintain what i believe to be a hallmark of the style .<ssssss>also the lack of spice make I very happy .<ssssss>mouthfeel : smooth rounded carbonation fit very well with the flavor profile lending smoothness but also pick up the hop but not accentuate the bitterness too much .<ssssss>drinkability : very drinkable on a cold night by the fire i believe that this beer would lose some of it be pleasurable quality if serve on a hot day as it be more flavorful than thirst quenching .<ssssss>a nice session beer in the winter though after about three i would not need many more .<ssssss>

#user#		#product#		8 7 9 10 6		thank you ppoitras for this very interesting barleywine .<ssssss>appearance : pour a deep amber color border towards tan .<ssssss>quite white head be about a inch and a half in a tulip glass , and last maybe for a quarter of the session before form a thing white film .<ssssss>aroma : strong alcohol nose that be not as hoppy as the other barleywine i have have .<ssssss>malt be also prevalent ... smell be almost of a unmashed malted barley .<ssssss>also detect hint of toast malt .<ssssss>taste : toastiness hit first , but i be suprise by the dryness of this barleywine .<ssssss>do not have the syrupy sweetness typical of the other barleywine i have have .<ssssss>there be a slight citrus/slight spicy hop flavor to it .<ssssss>also there be undertone of roasted malt -- possibly chocolate or even black malt .<ssssss>mouthfeel : dry , medium body .<ssssss>not overly sweet which be good , but not harshly bitter .<ssssss>very well balanced brew .<ssssss>drinkability : probably would not have grab another one if i have one available , but definitely not hard to finish the bottle .<ssssss>
#user#		#product#		5 9 8 8 8		pour a dark hazy muddy brown color with zero head .<ssssss>attempt to swirl and induce any head be futile ; very minimal spotty lacing .<ssssss>aroma begin with dark dark fruit , leather , oak and light light bourbon .<ssssss>as it warm more you get apple skin and vinous grape note .<ssssss>some sherry/light oxidate note be also present .<ssssss>really complex to say the least .<ssssss>the taste begin quite tart surprisingly .<ssssss>dark dark fruit , booze soak dark toast bread , sour cherry and vinous dry soaked oak .<ssssss>as i further sample i get more complex flavor of leather , brett barnyard funk/mustiness and some pit stone fruit .<ssssss>once again really complex and different than anything i have ever have .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium to full body with zero carbonation , which i usually hate but i do not mind it here .<ssssss>finish be super dry and oaky which be expect for 4 year of barrel aging .<ssssss>overall i be really please with this beer .<ssssss>as other have state , you will either love it or hate it .<ssssss>i be on the side that be a big fan .<ssssss>hopefully over the next year or so the bottle conditioning will up the carbonation a tad to add to the only downside this beer currently have .<ssssss>i imagine this be how many beer use to be back in ancient brewing time with lot of oak character and slight brett flavor .<ssssss>complex and recommend in my opinion ; maybe not worth the original elevated price tag but still tasty and worth a go if you do not have to give up a king 's ransom for it .<ssssss>
